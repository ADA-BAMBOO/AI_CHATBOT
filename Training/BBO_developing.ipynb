       "['The Cardano Govtool is a community tool that supports the key steps of Cardanos Governance process as described in CIP-1694. Govtool is part of the core governance tools. Intersect has facilitated the bootstrapping of GovTool and supported the process to fully open source it. allowing community ownership for improvement and maintenance. The Cardano Govtool. together with the other core tools such as the Constitutional Committee Portal. is currently managed by the Intersect Governance tools WG. the three existing pillars that make Govtool (Proposal Discussion. Delegation. and Voting) are developed and maintained by the WeDeliver Team. the Byron team and tested by the DQuadrand team. GovTool is an application that enables users to participate in many ways in the governance of the Cardano blockchain. View Governance Actions with or without connecting a wallet. Register to vote (Direct Voter) without becoming a DRep. Delegate Voting Power to a DRep. Register to become a Delegated Representative (DRep). allowing others to delegate their voting power to the DRep. Vote on Governance Actions - available to users that are registered to vote as DReps or Direct Voters. See results of Governace Action votes. Propose a Governance Action. Last updated 5 months ago.We read every piece of feedback. and take your input very seriously. To see all available qualifiers. see our documentation. . We propose a revision of Cardanos on-chain governance system to support the new requirements for Voltaire. The existing specialized governance support for protocol parameter updates and MIR certificates will be removed.. and two new fields will be added to normal transaction bodies for:. Any Cardano user will be allowed to submit a governance action. We also introduce three distinct governance bodies that have specific functions in this new governance framework:. Every governance action must be ratified by at least two of these three governance bodies using their on-chain votes. The type of action and the state of the governance system determines which bodies must ratify it. Ratified actions are then enacted on-chain. following a set of well-defined rules. As with stake pools. any Ada holder may register to be a DRep and so choose to. represent themselves and/or others. Also. as with stake pools. Ada holders may. instead. delegate their voting. rights to any other DRep. Voting rights will be based on the total Ada that is delegated. as a whole number of Lovelace. The most crucial aspect of this proposal is therefore the notion of one Lovelace = one vote. For the many contributors to this proposal. see Acknowledgements. Were heading into the age of Voltaire. laying down the foundations for decentralized decision-making. This CIP describes a mechanism for on-chain governance that will underpin the Voltaire phase of Cardano. The CIP builds on and extends the original Cardano governance scheme that was based on a fixed number of governance keys. It aims to provide a first step that is both valuable and. importantly. is also technically achievable. in the near term as part of the proposed Voltaire governance system. It also seeks to act as a jumping-off point for continuing community input.',\n",
       " ' including on appropriate threshold settings and other on-chain settings. Subsequent proposals may adapt and extend this proposal to meet emerging governance needs. The on-chain Cardano governance mechanism that was introduced in the Shelley ledger era is capable of:. In the current scheme. governance actions are initiated by special transactions that require Quorum-Many authorizations. from the governance keys (5 out of 7 on the Cardano mainnet)1. Fields in the transaction body provide details of the proposed governance action:. either i) protocol parameter changes; or ii) initiating funds transfers. Each transaction can trigger both kinds of governance actions. and a single action can have more than one effect (e. g. changing two or more protocol parameters). Properly authorized governance actions are applied on an epoch boundary (they are enacted). One of the protocol parameters is sufficiently significant to merit special attention:. changing the major protocol version enables Cardano to enact controlled hard forks. This type of protocol parameter update therefore has a special status. since stake pools. must upgrade their nodes so they can support the new protocol version once the hard fork is enacted. The Shelley governance design was intended to provide a simple. transitional approach to governance. This proposal aims to address a number of shortcomings with that design. that are apparent as we move into Voltaire. The Shelley governance design gives no room for active on-chain participation of Ada holders. While changes to the protocol are usually the results of discussions with selected community actors. the process is currently driven mainly by the founding entities. Ensuring that everyone can voice their concern is cumbersome. and can be perceived as arbitrary at times. Movements from the treasury constitute a critical and sensitive topic. However. they can be hard to track. It is important to have more transparency. and more layers of control over these movements. While they need to be treated specially by SPOs. hard forks are not differentiated from other protocol parameter changes. Finally. while there is currently a somewhat common vision for Cardano that is shared by its founding entities and also by many community members. there is no clearly defined document where these guiding principles are recorded. It makes sense to leverage the Cardano blockchain to record the shared Cardano ethos in an immutable fashion. as a formal Cardano Constitution. The following topics are considered to be out of the scope of this CIP. This CIP focuses only on on-chain mechanisms. The provisions of the initial constitution are extremely important. as are any processes that. will allow it to be amended. These merit their own separate and focused discussion. This is an off-chain issue. Any potential legal enforcement of either the Cardano protocol or the Cardano Constitution are completely out of scope for this CIP. The Cardano community must think deeply about the correct standards and processes for handling the creation of the governance actions that are specified in this CIP. In particular. the role of Project Catalyst in creating treasury withdrawal actions is completely outside the scope of this CIP.',\n",
       " ' How any private companies. public or private institutions.  individuals etc. choose to hold or delegate their Ada. including delegation to stake pools or DReps. is outside the scope of this CIP. The Cardano Constitution is a text document that defines Cardanos shared values and guiding principles. At this stage. the Constitution is an informational document that unambiguously captures the core values of Cardano. and acts to ensure its long-term sustainability. At a later stage. we can imagine the Constitution perhaps evolving into a smart-contract based set of rules that drives the entire governance framework. For now. however. the Constitution will remain an off-chain document whose hash digest value will be recorded on-chain. As discussed above. the Constitution is not yet defined and its content is out of scope for this CIP. We define a constitutional committee which represents a set of individuals or entities. (each associated with a Ed25519 or native or Plutus script credential) that are collectively responsible for ensuring that the Constitution is respected. Though it cannot be enforced on-chain. the constitutional committee is only supposed to vote. on the constitutionality of governance actions (which should thus ensure the long-term sustainability of the blockchain) and should be replaced. (via the no confidence action) if they overstep this boundary. Said differently. there is a social contract between the constitutional committee and the actors of the network. Although the constitutional committee could reject certain governance actions (by voting No on them). they should only do so when those governance actions are in conflict with the Constitution. For example. if we consider the hypothetical Constitution rule The Cardano network must always be able to produce new blocks. then a governance action that would reduce the maximum block size to 0 would be. in effect. unconstitutional and so might not be ratified by the constitutional committee. The rule does. not. specify the smallest acceptable maximum block size. so the constitutional committee would need to determine this number. and vote accordingly. The constitutional committee is considered to be in one of the following two states at all times:. In a state of no-confidence. the current committee is no longer able to participate in governance actions. and must be replaced before any governance actions can be ratified (see below). The constitutional committee will use a hot and cold key setup. similar to the existing genesis delegation certificate mechanism. The constitutional committee can be replaced via a specific governance action. (Update committee. described below) that requires the approval of both. the SPOs and the DReps. The threshold for ratification might be different depending on if the governance is. in a normal state or a state of no confidence. The new constitutional committee could. in principle. be identical to or partially overlap the outgoing committee as long as the action is properly ratified. This might happen. for example. if the electorate has collective confidence in all or part of the committee and wishes to extend its term of office. Unlike the Shelley governance design. the size of the constitutional committee is not fixed and can be any nonnegative number.',\n",
       " ' It may be changed whenever a new committee is elected (Update committee). Likewise. the committee threshold (the fraction of committee Yes votes that are required to ratify governance actions) is not fixed and. can also be varied by the governance action. This gives a great deal of flexibility to the composition of the committee. it is possible to elect an empty committee if the community wishes to abolish the constitutional committee entirely. Note that this is different from a state of no-confidence and still constitutes a governance system capable of enacting proposals. There will be a new protocol parameter for the minimal size of the committee. itself a nonnegative number called committeeMinSize. Each newly elected constitutional committee will have a term. Per-member terms allow for a rotation scheme. such as a third of the committee. expiring every year. Expired members can no longer vote. Member can also willingly resign early. which will be marked on-chain as an expired member. If the number of non-expired committee members falls below the minimal. size of the committee. the constitutional committee will be unable to. ratify governance actions. This means that only governance actions. that dont require votes from the constitutional committee can still. be ratified. a committee of size five with a threshold of 60% a minimum size. of three and two expired members can still. pass governance actions if two non-expired members vote Yes. if one more member expires then the constitutional committee becomes. unable to ratify any more governance actions. The maximum term is a governance protocol parameter. specified as a number of epochs. During a state of no-confidence. no action can be ratified. so the committee should plan for its own replacement if it wishes to avoid disruption. While the constitution is an informal. off-chain document. there will. also be an optional script that can enforce some guidelines. This script. acts to supplement the constitutional committee by restricting some. proposal types. if the community wishes to have some hard. rules for the treasury that cannot be violated. a script that enforces. these rules can be voted in as the guardrails script. The guardrails script applies only to protocol parameter update and. treasury withdrawal proposals. Warning. CIP-1694 DReps should not be conflated with Project Catalyst DReps. In order to participate in governance. a stake credential must be delegated to a DRep. Ada holders will generally delegate their voting rights to a registered DRep. that will vote on their behalf. In addition. two pre-defined voting options are available:. Abstain. If an Ada holder delegates to Abstain. then their stake is actively marked. as not participating in governance. The effect of delegating to Abstain on chain is that the delegated stake will not be considered to be. a part of the active voting stake. the stake will be considered to be registered for the. purpose of the incentives that are described in Incentives for Ada holders to delegate voting stake. No Confidence. If an Ada holder delegates to No Confidence. then their stake is counted.',\n",
       " ' as a Yes vote on every No Confidence action and a No vote on every other action. The delegated stake will be considered part of the active voting stake. It also serves as a directly auditable measure of the confidence of Ada holders in the constitutional. committee. Note. The pre-defined voting options do not cast votes inside of transactions. their behavior is accounted for at the protocol level. The Abstain option may be chosen for a variety of reasons. including the desire to not. participate in the governance system. Any Ada holder may register themselves as a DRep and delegate to themselves if they wish to actively participate in. voting. Any wallet serving as the Registered Reward Wallet for a Stake Pool can be delegated to one of these Pre-defined Voting Options and doing so will serve as the default voting option selected by the SPO for all Governance Action votes. excepting Hard Fork Governance Actions. Due to the need for robust consensus around Hard Fork initiations. these votes must be met as a percentage of the stake held by all stake pools. In Voltaire. existing stake credentials will be. able to delegate their stake to DReps for voting purposes. in addition to the current delegation to stake pools for block production. DRep delegation will mimic the existing stake delegation mechanisms (via on-chain certificates). Similarly. DRep registration will mimic the existing stake registration mechanisms. Additionally. registered DReps will need to vote regularly to still be considered active. Specifically. if a DRep does not submit any votes for drepActivity-many epochs. the DRep is considered inactive. where drepActivity is a new protocol parameter. Inactive DReps do not count towards the active voting stake anymore. and can become active again for. drepActivity-many epochs by voting on any governance actions or submitting a DRep update certificate. The reason for marking DReps as inactive is so that DReps who stop participating but still have. stake delegated to them do not eventually leave the system in a state where no governance. action can pass. Registered DReps are identified by a credential that can be either:. The blake2b-224 hash digest of a serialized DRep credential is called the DRep ID. The following new types of certificates will be added for DReps:. DRep registration certificates. DRep retirement certificates. and. vote delegation certificates. DRep registration certificates include:. An anchor is a pair of:. The structure and format of this metadata is deliberately left open in this CIP. The on-chain rules will not check either the URL or the hash. Client applications should. perform the usual sanity checks when fetching content from the provided URL. DRep retirement certificates include:. Note that a DRep is retired immediately upon the chain accepting a retirement certificate. and the deposit is returned as part of the transaction that submits the retirement certificate. (the same way that stake credential registration deposits are returned). Vote delegation certificates include:. DRep delegation always maps a stake credential to a DRep credential. This means that a DRep cannot delegate voting stake to another DRep.',\n",
       " ' The authorization scheme (i. e. which signatures are required for registration. retirement or delegation) mimics the existing stake delegation certificate authorization scheme. In addition to the existing per-stake-credential distribution and the. per-stake-pool distribution. the ledger will now also determine the per-DRep stake. distribution. This distribution will determine how much stake each vote from a DRep. is backed by. Unlike the distribution that is used for block production. we will always use the most. current version of the per-DRep stake distribution as given on the epoch boundary. This means that for any topic which individual voters care deeply about. they have time to delegate to themselves as a DRep and vote directly. it means that there may be a difference between the stake that is used for block. production and the stake that is used for voting in any given epoch. There will be a short bootstrapping phase during which rewards will be earned. for stake delegation etc. and may be withdrawn at any time. After this phase. although rewards will continue to be earned for block delegation etc. reward accounts will be. blocked from withdrawing any rewards unless their associated stake credential is also delegated to a DRep or pre-defined voting option. This helps to ensure high participation. and so. legitimacy. Even though rewards cannot be withdrawn. they are not lost. As soon as a stake credential is delegated. (including to a pre-defined voting option). the rewards can be withdrawn. DReps arguably need to be compensated for their work. Research on incentive models is still ongoing. and we do not wish to hold up implementation of this CIP while this is resolved. Our interim proposal is therefore to escrow Lovelace from the existing Cardano treasury until this. extremely important decision can be agreed on by the community. through the on-chain governance. mechanism that is being constructed. Alternatively. DReps could pay themselves through instances of the Treasury withdrawal governance action. Such an action would be auditable on-chain. and should reflect an off-chain agreement between DReps and delegators. We define seven different types of governance actions. A governance action is an on-chain event that is triggered by a transaction and has a deadline after which it cannot be enacted. Any Ada holder can submit a governance action to the chain. They must provide a deposit of govActionDeposit Lovelace. which will be returned when the action is finalized. (whether it is ratified or has expired). The deposit amount will be added to the deposit pot. similar to stake key deposits. It will also be counted towards the stake of the reward address it will be paid back to. to not reduce the submitters voting power to vote on their own (and competing) actions. If a guardrails script is present. the transaction must include that. script in the witness set either directly. or via reference inputs. and any other requirements that the guardrails script makes must be. satisfied. Note that a motion of no-confidence is an extreme measure that enables Ada holders to revoke the power.',\n",
       " ' that has been granted to the current constitutional committee. A single governance action might contain multiple protocol parameter updates. Many parameters are inter-connected and might require moving in lockstep. Governance actions are ratified through on-chain voting actions. Different kinds of governance actions have different ratification requirements but always involve two of the three governance bodies. with the exception of a hard-fork initiation and security-relevant protocol parameters. which requires ratification by all governance bodies. Depending on the type of governance action. an action will thus be ratified when a combination of the following occurs:. As explained above. different stake distributions apply to DReps and SPOs. A successful motion of no-confidence. update of the constitutional committee. a constitutional change. or a hard-fork. delays. ratification of all other governance actions until the first epoch after their enactment. This gives. an updated constitutional committee enough time to vote on current proposals. re-evaluate existing proposals. with respect to a new constitution. and ensures that the in principle arbitrary semantic changes caused. by enacting a hard-fork do not have unintended consequences in combination with other actions. The following table details the ratification requirements for each governance action scenario. The columns represent:. Governance action type. The type of governance action. Note that the protocol parameter updates are grouped into four categories. Constitutional committee (abbrev. CC). A value of ✓ indicates that the constitutional committee must approve this action. A value of - means that constitutional committee votes do not apply. DReps. The DRep vote threshold that must be met as a percentage of active voting stake. SPOs. The SPO vote threshold which must be met as a certain threshold of the total active voting stake. A value of - means that SPO votes do not apply. Each of these thresholds is a governance parameter. There is one. additional threshold. Q5. related to security relevant protocol. parameters. which is explained below. The initial thresholds should be chosen by the Cardano community as a whole. All thresholds for the Info action are set to 100% since setting it any lower. would result in not being able to poll above the threshold. Some parameters are relevant to security properties of the system. Any. proposal attempting to change such a parameter requires an additional. vote of the SPOs. with the threshold Q5. The security relevant protocol parameters are:. It may make sense for some or all thresholds to be adaptive with respect to the Lovelace that is actively registered to vote. a threshold could vary between 51% for a high level of registration and 75% for a low level registration. Moreover. the treasury threshold could also be adaptive. depending on the total Lovelace that is being withdrawn. or different thresholds could be set for different levels of withdrawal. To achieve legitimacy. the minimum acceptable threshold should be no less than 50% of the delegated stake. Apart from Treasury withdrawals and Infos. we include a mechanism for ensuring that governance. actions of the same type do not accidentally clash with each other in an unexpected way.',\n",
       " ' Each governance action must include the governance action ID for the most recently enacted action of its given type. This means that two actions of the same type can be enacted at the same time. but they must be deliberately designed to do so. Actions that have been ratified in the current epoch are prioritized as follows for enactment:. Note Info actions cannot be ratified or enacted. since they do not have any effect on the protocol. Governance actions are enacted in order of acceptance to the chain. This resolves conflicts where. there are two competing parameter changes. Governance actions are checked for ratification only on an epoch boundary. Once ratified. actions are staged for enactment. All submitted governance actions will therefore either:. In all of those cases. deposits are returned immediately. All governance actions are enacted on the epoch boundary after their ratification. Every governance action will include the following:. each action will include some elements that are specific to its type:. The new major protocol version must be precisely one greater than the current protocol version. Any two consecutive epochs will therefore either have the same major protocol version. or the. later one will have a major protocol version that is one greater. There can be no duplicate committee members - each pair of credentials in a committee must be unique. Each governance action that is accepted on the chain will be assigned a unique identifier (a. k. a. the governance action ID). consisting of the transaction hash that created it and the index within the transaction body that points to it. We have grouped the protocol parameter changes by type. allowing different thresholds to be set for each group. We are not. restricting each protocol parameter governance action to be contained within one group. In case where a governance action carries updates for multiple parameters from different groups. the maximum threshold of all the groups involved will apply to any given such governance action. The network.  economic and technical parameter groups collect existing protocol parameters that were introduced during the Shelley. Alonzo and Babbage eras. we introduce a new governance group that is specific to the new governance parameters that will be introduced by CIP-1694. The network group consists of:. The economic group consists of:. The technical group consists of:. The governance group consists of all the new protocol parameters that are introduced in this CIP:. Each vote transaction consists of the following:. For SPOs and DReps. the number of votes that are cast (whether Yes. No or Abstain) is proportional to the Lovelace that is delegated to them at the point the. action is checked for ratification. For constitututional committee members. each current committee member has one vote. Warning \\\\Abstain\\\\ votes are not included in the active voting stake. Note that an explicit vote to abstain differs from abstaining from voting. Unregistered stake that did not vote behaves like an Abstain vote. while registered stake that did not vote behaves like a No vote. To avoid confusion.',\n",
       " ' we will only use the word Abstain from this point onward to mean an on-chain vote to abstain. The governance credential witness will trigger the appropriate verifications in the ledger according to the existing UTxOW ledger rule. (i. a signature check for verification keys. and a validator execution with a specific vote redeemer and new Plutus script purpose for scripts). Votes can be cast multiple times for each governance action by a single credential. Correctly submitted votes override any older votes for the same credential and role. That is. the voter may change their position on any action if they choose. As soon as a governance action is ratified. voting ends and transactions containing further votes are invalid. When a governance action is successfully submitted to the chain. its progress will be tracked by the ledger state. the following will be tracked:. Since the stake snapshot changes at each epoch boundary. a new tally must be calculated when each unratified governance action. is checked for ratification. This means that an action could be enacted even though the DRep or SPO votes have not changed. (since the vote delegation could have changed). We define a number of new terms related to voting stake:. At first sight. the constitutional committee may appear to be a special committee that has been granted extra power over DReps. because DReps can replace the constitutional committee at any time and DRep votes are also required to ratify every governance action. the constitutional committee has no more (and may. in fact. have less) power than the DReps. Given this. what role does the committee play. and why is it not superfluous?. The answer is that the committee solves the bootstrapping problem of the new governance framework. Indeed. as soon as we pull the trigger and enable this framework to become active on-chain. then without a constitutional committee. there would rapidly need to be sufficient DReps. so that the system did not rely solely on SPO votes. We cannot yet predict how active the community will be in registering as DReps. nor how reactive other Ada holders will be regarding delegation of votes. Thus. the constitutional committee comes into play to make sure that the system can transition from. its current state into fully decentralized governance in due course. Furthermore. in the long run. the committee can play a mentoring and advisory role in the governance. decisions by being a set of elected representatives who are put under the spotlight for their judgment and guidance in governance decisions. Above all. the committee is required at all times to adhere to the Constitution and to ratify proposals in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Note that this CIP does not mention any kind of identity validation or verification for the members of the constitutional committee or the DReps. This is intentional. We hope that the community will strongly consider only voting for and delegating to those DReps who provide something like a DID to identify themselves. enforcing identity verification is very difficult without some centralized oracle.',\n",
       " ' which we consider to be a step in the wrong direction. Various mechanisms. such as quadratic voting. have been proposed to guard against entities with a large amount of influence. In a system based on 1 Lovelace. 1 vote. it is trivially easy to split stake into small amounts and undo the protections. Without an on-chain identity verification system we cannot adopt any such measures. The Cardano protocol is based on a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. so using a stake-based governance approach is sensible. there are many ways that could be used to define how to record the stake distribution between participants. As a reminder. network addresses can currently contain two sets of credentials: one to identify who can unlock funds at an address. (a. payment credentials) and one that can be delegated to a stake pool (a. delegation credentials). Rather than defining a third set of credentials. we instead propose to re-use the existing delegation credentials. using a new on-chain certificate to determine the governance stake distribution. This implies that the set of DReps can (and likely will) differ from the set of SPOs. so creating balance. On the flip side. it means that the governance stake distribution suffers from the same shortcomings as that for block production:. wallet software providers must support multi-delegation schemes and must facilitate the partitioning of stake into sub-accounts should an Ada holder desire to delegate to multiple DReps. or an Ada holder must manually split their holding if their wallet does not support this. this choice also limits future implementation effort for wallet providers and minimizes the effort that is needed for end-users to participate in the governance protocol. The latter is a sufficiently significant concern to justify the decision. By piggybacking on the existing structure. the system remains familiar to users and reasonably easy to set up. This maximizes both the chance of success of. and the rate of participation in. the governance framework. In contrast to other protocol parameter updates. hard forks (or. more correctly. changes to the protocols major version number) require much more attention. while other protocol parameter changes can be performed without significant software changes. a hard fork assumes that a super-majority of the network has upgraded the Cardano node to support the new set of features that are introduced by the upgrade. This means that the timing of a hard fork event must be communicated well ahead of time to all Cardano users. and requires coordination between stake pool operators. wallet providers. DApp developers. and the node release team. Hence. this proposal. unlike the Shelley scheme. promotes hard fork initiations as a standalone governance action. distinct from protocol parameter updates. Nothing in this proposal limits SPOs from becoming DReps. Why do we have DReps at all?. The answer is that SPOs are chosen purely for block production and not all SPOs will want to become DReps. Voters can choose to delegate their vote to DReps without needing to consider whether they are. also a good block producer. and SPOs can choose to represent Ada holders or not.',\n",
       " ' The requirements in the ratification requirement table are explained here. Most of the governance actions have the same kind of requirements:. the constitutional committee and the DReps must reach a sufficient number of. Yes votes. This includes these actions:. A motion of no-confidence represents a lack of confidence by the Cardano community in the. current constitutional committee. and hence the constitutional committee should not. be included in this type of governance action.

The Cardano Constitution. the Constitution is an informational document that unambiguously captures the core values of Cardano and acts to ensure its long-term sustainability.

We define a constitutional committee which represents a set of individuals or entities (each associated with a Ed25519 or native or Plutus script credential) that are collectively responsible for ensuring that the Constitution is respected. the constitutional committee is only supposed to vote on the constitutionality of governance actions (which should thus ensure the long-term sustainability of the blockchain) and should be replaced (via the no confidence action) if they overstep this boundary. The rule does not. so the constitutional committee would need to determine this number and vote accordingly. State of no-confidence. the current committee is no longer able to participate in governance actions and must be replaced before any governance actions can be ratified (see below). Constitutional committee keys. Replacing the constitutional committee. The constitutional committee can be replaced via a specific governance action (Update committee.',\n",
       " ' described below) that requires the approval of both the SPOs and the DReps. The threshold for ratification might be different depending on if the governance is in a normal state or a state of no confidence. Size of the constitutional committee. the committee threshold (the fraction of committee Yes votes that are required to ratify governance actions) is not fixed and can also be varied by the governance action. Terms. such as a third of the committee expiring every year. If the number of non-expired committee members falls below the minimal size of the committee. the constitutional committee will be unable to ratify governance actions. This means that only governance actions that dont require votes from the constitutional committee can still be ratified. a committee of size five with a threshold of 60% a minimum size of three and two expired members can still pass governance actions if two non-expired members vote Yes. if one more member expires then the constitutional committee becomes unable to ratify any more governance actions. Guardrails Script. there will also be an optional script that can enforce some guidelines. This script acts to supplement the constitutional committee by restricting some proposal types. if the community wishes to have some hard rules for the treasury that cannot be violated. a script that enforces these these rules can be voted in as the guardrails script. The guardrails script applies only to protocol parameter update and treasury withdrawal proposals. Delegated. Representatives (DReps). Pre-defined Voting Options. Ada holders will generally delegate their voting rights to a registered DRep that will vote on their behalf. The `Abstain` option may be chosen for a variety of reasons. including the desire to not participate in the governance system. Any Ada holder may register themselves as a DRep and delegate to themselves if they wish to actively participate in voting. Registered DReps. existing stake credentials will be able to delegate their stake to DReps for voting purposes. and can become active again for drepActivity -many epochs by voting on any governance actions or submitting a DRep update certificate. The reason for marking DReps as inactive is so that DReps who stop participating but still have stake delegated to them do not eventually leave the system in a state where no governance action can pass. The following new types of certificates will be added for DReps: DRep registration certificates. and vote delegation certificates. New stake distribution. In addition to the existing per-stake-credential distribution and the per-stake-pool distribution. the ledger will now also determine the per-DRep stake distribution. This distribution will determine how much stake each vote from a DRep is backed by. we will always use the most current version of the per-DRep stake distribution as given on the epoch boundary. it means that there may be a difference between the stake that is used for block production and the stake that is used for voting in any given epoch.

Similar to the motion of no-confidence. electing a constitutional committee depends on both the SPOs and the DReps to represent the will of the community. The versatility of the info governance action. While not binding on chain. the Info governance action could be useful in an number of situations. These include:. Hard-Fork initiation. Regardless of any governance mechanism. SPO participation is needed for any hard fork since they must upgrade their node software. For this reason. we make their cooperation explicit in the hard fork initiation governance action. by always requiring their vote. The constitutional committee also votes. signaling the constitutionality of a hard fork. The DReps also vote. to represent the will of every stake holder. New Metadata structures. The governance actions. the votes and the certificates and the Constitution use new metadata fields. in the form of URLs and integrity hashes (mirroring the metadata structure for stake pool registration). The metadata is used to provide context. Governance actions need to explain why the action is needed. what experts were consulted. etc. Since transaction size constraints should not limit this explanatory data. we use URLs instead. This does. introduce new problems. If a URL does not resolve. what should be the expectation for voting on that action? Should we expect everyone to vote No? Is this an attack vector against the governance system? In such a scenario. the hash pre-image could be communicated in other ways. but we should be prepared for the situation. Should there be a summary of the justification on chain?. Alternative: Use of transaction metadata. Instead of specific dedicated fields in the transaction format. we could instead use the existing transaction metadata field. Governance-related metadata can be clearly identified by registering a CIP-10 metadata label.',\n",
       " ' Within that. the structure of the metadata can be determined by this CIP (exact format TBD). using an index to map the vote or governance action ID to the corresponding metadata URL and hash. This avoids the need to add additional fields to the transaction body. at the risk of making it easier for submitters to ignore. since the required metadata can be empty (or can point to a non-resolving URL). it is already easy for submitters to not provide metadata. and so it is unclear whether this makes the situation worse. Note that transaction metadata is never stored in the ledger state. so it would be up to clients to pair the metadata with the actions and votes in this alternative. and would not be available as a ledger state query. Controlling the number of active governance actions. Since governance actions are available for anyone to submit. we need some mechanism to prevent those individuals responsible for voting from becoming overwhelmed with a flood of proposals. A large deposit is one such mechanism. but this c.Cardano is a blockchain platform for changemakers. innovators. and visionaries.  with the tools and technologies required to create possibility for the many. as well as the few.  and bring about positive global change. Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform: the first to be founded on peer-reviewed research                 and developed through evidence-based methods. It combines pioneering technologies                 to provide unparalleled security and sustainability to decentralized applications. systems.                 and societies. With a leading team of engineers. Cardano exists to redistribute power from unaccountable                 structures to the margins – to individuals – and be an enabling force for positive change and progress. Protocol. Research. Transact. Open. Ouroboros is the first peer-reviewed. verifiably-secure blockchain protocol. and Cardano is the first blockchain         to implement it. Ouroboros enables decentralization in the Cardano network on a sustainable scale for global requirements         and most crucially. without compromising security. The protocol is the result of tireless efforts. based on foundational         research. propelled by a vision for more secure and transparent global payment systems. and provides the means to equitably redistribute         power and control. Learn about Ouroboros. Cardano is the first blockchain platform to be built through peer-reviewed research.             to be secure enough to protect the data of billions. scalable enough to accommodate global systems.             and robust enough to support foundational change. We have changed science. We have changed what it means to build global systems and sustainable models of exchange and governance. Alongside the community. entities. and companies building on Cardano. a new future is being defined: a decentralized future without intermediaries. where power is returned to the individual. Multiple independent entities collaborate within a decentralized team framework to drive Cardano forward. ensuring that it remains aligned with its core mission as it progresses and develops.

Last updated 3 months ago. as it puts the community at the forefront of blockchain governance. Following the Chang upgrade. the Interim Constitution will be on-chain and in effect until the community ratifies another constitution. The Interim Constitution is intended to be minimal and temporary. allowing for the Chang upgrade to proceed by fulfilling the requirement of CIP-1694 to have a Cardano Constitution. The Interim Constitution therefore allows time for the community to converge on a more holistic constitution for Cardano. The Cardano Constitution Consultation period span all of 2024. summarised in the roadmap:. The first half of 2024 included work across Intersect committees and staff to prepare for the latter half of 2024 where broad community engagement is taking place. The Cardano Civics Committee and Parameters Sub Committee have collaborated to prepare the Interim Constitution for the Change upgrade. The Cardano Civics Committee. working with several relevant experts. have evaluated the Interim Constitution to identify areas for improvement. and develop a draft Constitution that align with Cardano’s vision for a decentralised. inclusive. and transparent governance structure. The Draft Constitution serves as critical input for the Constitutional Workshops. Starting in August and ending by Oct 15th. the Constitutional Workshops were a series of community hosted workshops designed with two objectives:. Gather broad and diverse community input on the Draft Constitution. Select Constitutional Delegates to attend the Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires in Dec. Each workshop will select a ranked list of 5 candidates. First place is the Voting Delegate. 2nd place is the Travelling Alternate. 3rd place is the Backup Alternate #1. 4th place is the Backup Alternate #2. and 5th place is the Backup Alternate #3. Each Constitutional workshop were designed to address specific outstanding questions related to the Draft Constitution. Through structured discussions and interactive sessions. attendees responded to important questions that could not be resolved without broad community input. These workshops  developed actionable recommendations that became synthesised across 63 workshops to guide updates to the Draft Constitution. Constitutional Delegates are responsible for reviewing the updated draft at the Constitutional Convention to approve to proceed for on-chain voting.A Constitution for fully decentralized on-chain governance: ensuring every ada holder has a voice in shaping the future of the Cardano network. The eras of Cardano represented major phases of development. each addressing an important challenge. Cardano has an ethos of openness and transparency. It was designed by a global team of experts who are leaders in disciplines ranging from distributed systems to programming languages and game theory.

Foundation. Decentralization. Smart contracts. Scaling. Governance. The first version of Cardano launched in September 2017. with the Byron era. The Cardano community began. with users buying and selling ada on a federated network using the ground-breaking Ouroborus consensus protocol. The second era of Cardano was the Shelley era. This encompassed the early steps towards optimized decentralization. transitioning smoothly from the federated model of Byron to more nodes being run by the Cardano community. This era integrated smart contracts into the network. enabling the community to build decentralized applications (DApps) on Cardano’s foundation. The Basho era focused on optimizing the underlying performance of Cardano to support growth and adoption. Crucially. sidechains were introduced to vastly improve and extend the capabilities of the network. The Voltaire era provided the final pieces to enable the Cardano network to be self-sustaining. It includes on-chain voting. institutions. and constitutional representation.The Roadmap and the Dawn of Voltaire.Was this helpful?.

Based on ledger design cddl: node 8. 8. 0-pre. ⚠ There are currently two ways to register/unregister stake credentials because the old stake_registration and stake_deregistration will be deprecated in the era following the Conway era. ⚠. The new version allows the ledger to check deposit amounts and return them instantly (rather than on epoch boundary). matching the other new certificates containing deposits. This change has been made to enable the checking of deposit amounts at the ledger level. It also proves to be more useful in Voltaire. given that protocol parameters are likely to change more frequently than in past eras. The decision to provide only the script hash. rather than the entire script. within a new constitution proposal serves the purpose of reusing the mechanisms previously implemented in Babbage. For instance. it allows individuals to use reference scripts to provide the actual script for the proposal policy when proposing various governance actions. Creating another source for scripts would entail more work. The new constitution proposal contains a ScriptHash. also known as the proposal policy. There is nothing special that needs to be done during the proposal stage because the policy is simply being suggested. The significance comes into play when a new constitution with a script hash (proposal policy) is enacted. At that point. the constitution will require scripts and redeemers for every governance proposal. except for the new_constitution and no_confidence proposals. In these cases. it will function in a manner similar to other scripts. This tag is yet to be implemented. The designated tag for such instances will be 5. with the index in the redeemer corresponding to the proposal procedure. there will be tag 4 – specifically for voting procedures. With numerous Plutus versions having distinct cost models. accommodating all of them may become impractical. Nevertheless. its highly unlikely to exceed the maximum transaction size in the near future. There are no checks for this at the ledger level. neither for SPOs nor for DReps. At any point. the DRep and the SPO to whom you delegated can unregister. so there is no need to enforce their existence when delegating. No. there is no mechanism to facilitate that action. The purpose of the deposit is to restrict the use of those funds.',\n",
       " ' DRep deposits function similarly to stake credential deposits. They are refunded in the transaction that unregisters the DRep. Stake pool and proposal procedures are retired or expired on the epoch boundary. which is why their deposits are refunded into a reward account. DReps and stake credentials are unregistered immediately. Donations function more like fees. They are collected in a pool and then transferred at the epoch boundary. The current treasury value is used for conveying the current treasury amount to Plutus scripts. If the treasury field is set incorrectly. the transaction will be rejected. Resigned and expired constitutional committee members are automatically counted as if they have voted Abstain. Another crucial point to note is that whenever the number of active committee members (those who are neither expired nor resigned) falls below the committeeMinSize protocol parameter. the system enters a mode in which it is as though all committee members have cast a No vote. Yes. It is only optional. when there is no governance policy. When there is a governance policy we require that policy_hash to be present and equal to the one in the elected constitution. they are rational numbers on the unit interval where both numerator and denominator are specified by 64bit unsigned integers. So. those thresholds can be very precise. the amount in the reward account is counted towards active stake. which means it will also participate in the voting. This decision was to prevent people from constantly withdrawing rewards just so they can get rewards on that amount. The only deposits which count toward voting stake thresholds are deposits locked for governance actions.Governance tooling is owned and maintained by the community. With community approval. through its committees and working groups. plays an important role in hosting and maintaining these governance tools. Through active community involvement. the aim is to create the initial Governance foundation layer together with different builders in the community. These governance tools support the whole process. both off-chain and on-chain. and as a whole they support the implementation of the governance described in CIP-1694 and its adoption. The community is able to further contribute to these tools by maintaining and improving existing features and pillars. creating new features or completely new areas either by themselves or supported by awards and grants facilitated by Intersect. With the freedom to test and refine Cardano’s next era of governance principles under one central apparatus. GovTool helps the Cardano community forge a future governance framework that represents the community’s best democratic interests.

You are now registered and can vote as a DRep and also accept delegated voting power from others.If a DRep no longer wants to participate in Governance. they can opt to retire. Retiring means that a DRep gives up voting rights. Voting Power that is delegated to the DRep will remain in place. i. will still be delegated to the DReps ID. ADA Holders that have delegated to be able to see that a DRep is retired in the DRep directory. They will be able to re-delegate their Voting Power to another DRep. Retired DReps can still participate in Governance by proposing Governance Actions. by delegating their personal Voting Power to another DRep. or by coming out of retirement. and assuming their previous role as a DRep. If a DRep comes out of retirement. their DRep ID will be the same as it was before retirement. and their Voting Power will consist of their own ADA balance and what delegated power that is associated \\\\u2028to your DRep ID.These errors arise when GovTool cannot find or cannot verify the data entered and stored by the DRep. at the time of the most recent registration or data change. GovTool uses external sources for DRep data. and these sources are maintianed by the DReps themselves. This error means that GovTool cannot locate the data on the URL specified when the DRep was originally registered. This error means that the data stored by the DRep does not match the data supplied by the DRep when they originally registered. This error means that the data stored by the DRep does not match the format defined by the DRep spec. and that the data is not in the correct format as specified by the DRep spec.

The person or organisation that you delegate to are called DReps. which is short for Delegate Representatives. DReps represent you in a similar way as a parliamentary or congressional representative does in an analog government. Simply put. they vote on your behalf. You can also use your Voting Power with \\\\Automatic\\\\ voting options: These special options are for voting \\\\Abstain\\\\.  or voting No Confidence on all proposals. These options are similar to DReps in that they vote for you. The main functions of Delegating:. To delegate your personal Voting Power to someone else. who has registered previously as a dRep.',\n",

Anyone that has ADA in a wallet can propose a Governace Action. To submit a Governance Action. the submitter  pays a refundable deposit of 100.000 Ada. The deposit will be returned automatically back to the submitters wallet upon completion of the Voting period. a deposit amount (recorded since the amount of the deposit is an updatable protocol parameter). a reward address to receive the deposit when it is repaid. an anchor for any metadata that is needed to justify the action. a hash digest value to prevent collisions with competing actions of the same type (as described earlier). Governance Actions are covered in depth in CIP-1694. which is the main defining document for governance on Cardano. You can read about the entirety of Cardano Governance in this document. Connect a wallet (Compatible Wallets) to GovTool that has at least 100.000 Ada plus a few extra Ada for transaction fees. Create a Proposal for the Governace Action Propose a Governance Action. Store the metadata for your Governance Action yourself Storing Information offline. At this point. your Governance Action is in the Proposal stage.

A normal state (i. a state of confidence). A state of no-confidence. the current committee is no longer able to participate in governance actions and must be replaced before any governance actions can be ratified. To pass. this Action requires:. Doesnt Vote. 67%. 51%. These values could be changed via a new Government Action. To see the current values at any time. you can view https://cardanoscan. io/protocolparams.This action will have one or more of these data objects:. The set of verification key hash digests (members to be removed). Members can be removed either singly or in multiples. A map of verification key hash digests to epoch numbers (new members and their term limit). New members can be added along with their term ending epoch dates. A fraction (new threshold). The threshold for passing an Action can be changed. 60%. An anchor to the Constitution. Optional script hash of the Guardrails Script. Pass. 75%. Doesnt vote.This action will have:. The new (greater) major protocol version. Note:. There are many varying definitions of the term hard fork in the blockchain industry. Hard forks typically refer to non-backwards compatible updates of a network. In Cardano. we formalise the definition slightly more by calling any upgrade that would lead to more blocks being validated a hard fork and force nodes to comply with the new protocol version. effectively obsoleting nodes that are unable to handle the upgrade.There are four types of protocol parameter changes. changes are not restricted to any groupp. In case where a Governance Action carries updates for multiple parameters from different groups. The four types of parameter changes:. maximum block body size (maxBlockBodySize). maximum transaction size (maxTxSize). maximum block header size (maxBlockHeaderSize). maximum size of a serialised asset value (maxValueSize). maximum script execution units in a single transaction (maxTxExecutionUnits). maximum script execution units in a single block (maxBlockExecutionUnits). maximum number of collateral inputs (maxCollateralInputs).

Generally speaking. most data in Governance is stored off-chain. and is referenced by an on-chain url and hash. For more detailed information. please see CIP-1694. Off-chain data can be stored in many places. such as IPFS. a web URL. or repo site like GitHub. The URL that references the data has to be publicly readable. Here is an example of using GitHub for storing data for a Governance Action. Storing data for becoming a DRep is the same process. Agree to store information and click Continue. Your information will be packaged up in a. jsonld file. Click on the button with the filename in it. and save it to your computer. If you dont have a github account. you will need to create one. Simply enter your email address and click Sign up for GitHub. Click Continue. Create a password. click Continue. Create a github user name (must be unique on github). GitHub will send you a confirmation code to your email inbox. Find it and enter it here. You now have a new GitHub account. You must create a repository. so in the screen below:. Create a name for your repository. Make your repository public. Click Create Repository. Now you have a public GitHub repository of your own!.

This will show the history of Governance Actions that have been ratified or rejected. Last updated 7 months ago.Last updated 17 days ago. GovTool aims to show vote total values which help the user gauge likelihood of ratification of an action. Active DRep stake = all the voting power of DReps within the active state. (This does not include any in-active DReps OR retired DReps). Total Active Stake = Active DRep stake + auto no confidence stake. We do not include any abstain within this. as they are not part of ratification equation. Total voting power of DRep Abstain votes + auto-abstain stake. IF governance action type != NoConfidence. Total of voting power of DReps Yes votes. IF governance action type == NoConfidence. Total of voting power of DReps Yes votes + auto no confidence stake. (Yes Total / Total Active Stake) x 100. Total of voting power of DReps No votes + auto no confidence stake. Total of voting power of DReps No votes. (No Total / Total Active Stake) x 100. Total Active Stake - Yes Total - No Total. 100 - yes percentage - no percentage. this should equal ((Total Active Stake - Yes Total - No Total) / Total Active Stake ) * 100. See GovTools SQL query run on DB-Sync. This pulls all the proposal data. and vote totals. GovTool takes DRep voting power from drep_distr table of DB-Sync for the registered DReps and the predefined voting option DReps. this data is only updated once per epoch. GovTool takes the newest vote from DReps for that governance action. filtering out votes from DReps who have recently retired. In the SQL query. Gets the latest epoch of DRep distribution. Gets the voting power of the predefined no confidence DRep. Gets the voting power of the predefined always abstain DRep.',\n",
       " ' Calculates Yes Total. Calculates No Total. Calculates Abstain Total. So we have some DRep John Doe. who voted yes on X governance action. John Doe has 100k Voting power coming from his own stake and all delegators (we are taking that value directly from db-sync (no calculations on GovTool side)). We have another DRep - Andre. who has 200k Voting power!. Andre also likes the governance action and votes yes. As a result - we display the sum of their voting powers. so it would be 300k for yes votes. Important note - John Doe and Andre can change their votes. For SPOs logic is completely the same as the DReps one - the difference is that we are taking the voting power from a different table - dedicated to SPOs (pool_stat).Using your voting power allows you to participate in Cardano Governance. Every ADA holder has an amount of Voting Power equal to the amount of Lovelace they have in a wallet. When you link a wallet containing ADA to GovTool. GovTool will read the ADA balance in the wallet. and make it available to you to use as Voting Power. Voting Power can be used in several ways:. How to delegate your Voting Power. Delegate your Voting Power to Abstain or Signal No Confidence. These effectively instruct GovTool to cast these votes on every Governance Action on your behalf. These options work like DReps. and they apply to every Governance Action that comes up for a vote. Become a Direct Voter and Vote on Governance Actions by yourself. How to become a Direct Voter. Become a DRep and Vote on Governance Actions with your own Voting Power and Voting Power shared with you by other users.What is the difference?. Direct voters are a concept that GovTool adds on top of the on-chain DRep mechanism. Direct Voters are not explicitly supported by the protocol but are instead an abstraction over the on-chain DReps. Like DReps a Direct Voter is someone that can vote on any Governance Action with their own Voting Power. They do not wish to campaign for delegations from others or be shown via the DRep Directory. GovTool considers (on-chain) DReps who do not wish to attach metadata to their DRep as Direct voters. The rationale being. those who wish to vote but not represent others are unlikely to want to attach metadata to their registration. They do not wish to be a representative. Other tools likely show Direct Voters as DReps. as on-chain they are. The idea of a direct voter came out of user tests for GovTool. where calling everyone who just wants to vote a delegated representative caused much confusion. Direct voter concept aims to reduce the potential for this confusion.Delegated Representatives (DReps) are like parlimentary representatives in the Governance system. DReps can have other ADA holders to delegate their voting power to them. which allows DReps to vote by proxy using the accumulated Voting Power of all their delegators. Read about how to become a DRep.',\n",
       " 'We define seven different types of governance actions. An action is said to be ratified when it gathers enough votes in its favor (through the rules and parameters that are detailed below). An action that fails to be ratified before its deadline is said to have expired. An action that has been ratified is said to be enacted once it has been activated on the network. A motion to create a state of no-confidence in the current constitutional committee. New constitutional committee and/or threshold and/or terms. Changes to the members of the constitutional committee and/or to its signature threshold and/or terms. Update to the Constitution or proposal policy. A modification to the Constitution or proposal policy. recorded as on-chain hashes. Hard-Fork2 Initiation. Triggers a non-backwards compatible upgrade of the network; requires a prior software upgrade. Protocol Parameter Changes. Any change to one or more updatable protocol parameters. excluding changes to major protocol versions (hard forks). Treasury Withdrawals. Withdrawals from the treasury. Info. An action that has no effect on-chain. other than an on-chain record. If a proposal policy is present. the transaction must include that policy in the witness set either directly. and any other requirements that the proposal policy makes must be satisfied.Delegated Representatives (DReps) are ADA holders who registered on-chain to allow other members of the community to delegate their voting power to them.For ada holders voting power refers to the amount of ada they own. For registered DReps Voting Power refers both to the voting power they own and to the voting power that other ada holders have delegated to them. Voting Power is calculated at the end of every epoch. When a Voter casts a Vote in GovTool. the Votes are also tallied only at epoch boundaries.The technical bootstrapping phase is a temporary state of governance as described in CIP-1694 Bootstrapping Phase. Within this state only a limited set of governance features are enabled by the network. Are able to register as DReps/ direct voters. Are able to delegate to DReps.

Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers. Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name. GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription. trial. or through an existing verified OSS. Student. Faculty. or MVP account may elect to use Free instead. GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language. the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions. GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code. Vim. Neovim. the JetBrains suite of IDEs. and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions. chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code. JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary.',\n",
       " ' With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan. GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub. com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organizations knowledge. GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination. When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues. it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code. but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion. they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase. To generate a code suggestion. the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor. but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model. to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions. To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor. the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document. your code selection. and general workspace information. such as frameworks. languages. and dependencies. To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub. such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt. Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts. the open pages on GitHub. com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management. policy management. and IP indemnity. Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE. CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also\\\\xa0 adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub. com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot\\\\xa0 throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom. private models for code completion. GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers. freelancers. students. educators. and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management. GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub. OpenAI. and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources. including code in public repositories on GitHub. GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code.',\n",
       " ' and is included in GitHub Advanced Security. Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor. enabling or disabling it at any time. you have control over which file types Copilot is active for. Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features. models. and set Copilot policies for your organization. you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details. refer to the documentation. GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers. If youre on the Free plan. you can upgrade to Pro through your Copilot settings page or directly on the Copilot marketing page. GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits). and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories. GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub. mobile app. extensions. or one of various IDE extensions. or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI). IDE code completions. or personalized chat on GitHub. The types of personal data processed may include:. User Engagement Data: This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot. such as accepted or dismissed completions. error messages. system logs. and product usage metrics. Prompts: These are inputs for chat or code. along with context. sent to Copilots AI to generate suggestions. Suggestions: These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts. Feedback Data: This comprises real-time user feedback. including reactions (e. thumbs up/down) and optional comments. along with feedback from support tickets. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models. How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web. computer terminal. and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:. Deliver. maintain. and update the services as per the customers configuration and usage. to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations. Troubleshoot. which involves preventing. detecting. resolving. and mitigating issues. including security incidents and product-related problems. by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services functionality and up-to-dateness. Enhance user productivity. reliability. effectiveness. quality. accessibility. and security by keeping the service current and operational. These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement (DPA). which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers. GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA. for the following purposes:. Billing and account management. To comply with and resolve legal obligations. For abuse detection. prevention. and protection. virus scanning. and scanning to detect violations of terms of service. To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives. To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning. covering areas like forecasting.',\n",
       " ' revenue analysis. capacity planning. and product strategy. For details on GitHubs data processing activities as a controller. particularly for Copilot Pro customers. refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement. If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:. Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:. Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained. User Engagement Data: Kept for two years. Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose. All other GitHub Copilot access and use:. Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days. Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github. mobile. and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation. While weve designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind. the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we cant guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals. These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement. The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code. which may include copyrighted code. and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:. Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:\\\\xa0 Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn. understand. extract patterns. and facts from copyrighted materials. including software code. the European Union. Japan. and Singapore. have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada. India. and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use. What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research). suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again. Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code. but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion. Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize. or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method.',\n",
       " ' If a code suggestion matches existing code. there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement. which would depend on the amount and nature of code used. and the context of how the code is used. In many ways. this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate. such as copying code from an online source. or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code. In Copilot. you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub. see Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub. If you have allowed suggestions that match public code. GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement. so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion. and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances. GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub. GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise. or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled. Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average.150 characters). If there is a match. the suggestion will not be shown to the user. In addition to off-topic. harmful. and offensive output filters. GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code. GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match. users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log. including where the match occurred. any applicable licenses. and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub. com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses. and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in. as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use. and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them. We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned. but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.',\n",
       " ' the intellectual property law in the relevant country. the length of the suggestion. the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive. etc). If a suggestion is capable of being owned. our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership. GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases. it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems. Public code may contain insecure coding patterns. bugs. or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data. it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns. including hardcoded credentials. SQL injections. and path injections. in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security. GitHub Actions. Dependabot. and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course. you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools. as well as your own judgment. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers. who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin. The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code. Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said. whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing. code scanning. security testing. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it. Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective                        risk tolerances. As noted above. GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers. or their individual skill and judgment. and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions. Depending on your particular use case. you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards. You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature. the copyright responsibility is ours. not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI. GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot.',\n",
       " ' See Microsofts Copilot Copyright Commitment for more details. We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with                        disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum. GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid                        synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter                        system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs. please report them directly to copilot-safety@github. com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it. Given public sources are predominantly in English. GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore. non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found here. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans.

On GitHub. lightweight code review tools are built into every pull request. Your team can create review processes that improve the quality of your code and fit neatly into your workflow. Every change starts with a pull request. Preview changes in context with your code to see what is being proposed. Side-by-side Diffs highlight added. edited. and deleted code right next to the original file. so you can easily spot changes. Browse commits. and references related to your pull request in a timeline-style interface. Your pull request will also highlight what’s changed since you last checked. See what a file looked like before a particular change. With blame view. you can see how any portion of your file has evolved over time without viewing the file’s full history. conversations happen alongside your code. Leave detailed comments on code syntax and ask questions about structure inline. If you’re on the other side of the code. requesting peer reviews is easy. Add users to your pull request. and they’ll receive a notification letting them know you need their feedback. Save your teammates a few notifications. Bundle your comments into one cohesive review. then specify whether comments are required changes or just suggestions. You can’t always avoid conflict. Merge pull requests faster by resolving simple merge conflicts on GitHub—no command line necessary. Reviews can improve your code. but mistakes happen. Limit human error and ensure only high quality code gets merged with detailed permissions and status checks. Give collaborators as much access as they need through your repository settings. You can extend access to a few teams and select which ones can read or write to your files. The options you have for permissions depend on your plan. Protected Branches help you maintain the integrity of your code. Limit who can push to a branch. and disable force pushes to specific branches. Then scale your policies with the Protected Branches API. Create required status checks to add an extra layer of error prevention on branches. Use the Status API to enforce checks and disable the merge button until they pass. To err is human; to automate. divine!.

GitHub Advanced Security is the native Static Application Security Testing (SAST) solution for GitHub Enterprise and Azure DevOps. Designed to accelerate the delivery of secure software. GitHub Advanced Security adds cutting-edge tools for static analysis. software composition analysis. and secret scanning to the GitHub platform that developers already know and love. Unlike traditional application security packages that burden the software development toolchain with complex workflows that inhibit adoption. GitHub Advanced Security makes it easy for developers to find and fix vulnerabilities earlier in the software development life cycle. By adding GitHub Advanced Security to the GitHub platform. security leaders can address compliance requirements while empowering development teams to solve customer problems. surpass competitors. and reduce the time-to-value for software development projects. Unlike third-party security add-ons. GitHub Advanced Security operates entirely in the native GitHub workflows that developers already know and love. By making it easier for developers to remediate vulnerabilities as they go. GitHub Advanced Security frees time for security teams to focus on critical strategies that protect businesses. customers. and communities from application-based vulnerabilities. DevSecOps refers to a combination of the development. and operations tools necessary to develop software applications. Application security (AppSec) is the process of finding. fixing. and preventing security vulnerabilities in applications. GitHub Advanced Security provides AppSec tools for static application security testing (SAST). which identifies vulnerabilities in the code itself. Unlike dynamic application security testing (DAST). which probes live applications for vulnerabilities. GitHub Advanced Security helps keep vulnerabilities out of production. The GitHub platform itself features multiple layers of security to keep developers and their code safe in transit and at rest. GitHub Advanced Security can be added to GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC) and GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) plans.

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content. such as issues. users. and discussions. is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search. see About searching on GitHub and Searching on GitHub. Search queries consist of search terms. comprising text you want to search for. and qualifiers. which narrow down the search. A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the files path. the following query:. The above query will match the file docs/http-push. txt. even if it doesnt contain the term http-push. It will also match a file called example.',\n",
       " ' txt if it contains the term http-push. You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms. The search results would include all documents containing both the terms sparse and index. in any order. As examples. it would match a file containing SparseIndexVector. a file with the phrase index for sparse trees. and even a file named index. txt that contains the term sparse. Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search hello AND world. Other boolean operations. such as hello OR world. are also supported. For more information about boolean operations. see Using boolean operations. Code search also supports searching for an exact string. including whitespace. see Query for an exact match. You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers. such as repo:. language: and path:. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search. see Using qualifiers. You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions. see Using regular expressions. To search for an exact string. you can surround the string in quotes. For example:. You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers. for example:. To search for code containing a quotation mark. you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. to find the exact string name = tensorflow. you can search:. To search for code containing a backslash. \\\\\\\\. use a double backslash. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. The two escape sequences \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ and \\\\\\\\ can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized. though. A backslash that isn\\\\t followed by either  or \\\\\\\\ is included in the search. unchanged. Additional escape sequences. such as \\\\\\\\n to match a newline character. are supported in regular expressions. See Using regular expressions. Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators AND. OR. and NOT to combine search terms. By default. adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the AND operator. the search query sparse index is the same as sparse AND index. meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms sparse and index. To search for documents containing either one term or the other. you can use the OR operator. the following query will match documents containing either sparse or index:. To exclude files from your search results. you can use the NOT operator. to exclude files in the __testing__ directory. You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search. To search within a repository. use the repo: qualifier. You must provide the full repository name. including the owner. To search within a set of repositories. you can combine multiple repo: qualifiers with the boolean operator OR. Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names. so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the repo: qualifier to work.',\n",
       " ' To search for files within an organization. use the org: qualifier. To search for files within a personal account. use the user: qualifier. Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names. so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work. To narrow down to a specific languages. use the language: qualifier. For a complete list of supported language names. see languages. yaml in github-linguist/linguist. If your preferred language is not on the list. you can open a pull request to add it. To search within file paths. use the path: qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. to find files containing the term unit_tests in their path. use:. The above query will match both src/unit_tests/my_test. py and src/docs/unit_tests. md since they both contain unit_test somewhere in their path. To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path). you could use a regular expression:. Note that the. in the filename is escaped. since. has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions. You can also use some limited glob expressions in the path: qualifier. to search for files with the extension txt. you can use:. glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path. so the above expression would still match a path like app/src/main. But if you prefix the expression with /. it will anchor to the start. Note that * doesnt match the / character. so for the above example. all results will be direct descendants of the src directory. To match within subdirectories. so that results include deeply nested files such as /src/app/testing/utils/example. you can use **. You can also use the ? global character. to match the path file. aac or file. abc. Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings. so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string file?. You can search for symbol definitions in code. such as function or class definitions. using the symbol: qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source Tree-sitter parser ecosystem. so no extra setup or build tool integration is required. to search for a symbol called WithContext:. In some languages. you can search for symbols using a prefix (e. a prefix of their class name). for a method deleteRows on a struct Maint. you could search symbol:Maint. deleteRows if you are using Go. or symbol:Maint::deleteRows in Rust. You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the String type:. Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references. and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:. We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort. you can add support for your language in the open source Tree-sitter parser ecosystem.',\n",
       " ' upon which symbol search is based. bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths. use the content: qualifier. This query would only match files containing the term README. md. rather than matching files named README. To filter based on repository properties. you can use the is: qualifier. is: supports the following values:. Note that the is: qualifier can be inverted with the NOT operator. To search for non-archived repositories. To exclude forks from your results. Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers. by surrounding the regex in slashes. to search for the regular expression sparse. *index. you would use:. Note that youll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. to search for files within the App/src directory. Inside a regular expression. \\\\\\\\n stands for a newline character. \\\\\\\\t stands for a tab. and \\\\\\\\x{hhhh} can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you cant type into the search bar. Most common regular expressions features work in code search. look-around assertions are not supported. All parts of a search. such as search terms. exact strings. qualifiers. parentheses. and the boolean keywords AND. and NOT. must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses. ( ). dont need to be separated from the parentheses. If your search contains multiple components that arent separated by spaces. or other text that does not follow the rules listed above. code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code. If code search guesses wrong. you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear. code search is case-insensitive. and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. to search for the string True.GitHub requires JavaScript to proceed with the sign up process.

Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) fulfil the same role for Cardano as the standards of other blockchains. including BIPs for Bitcoin and EIPs for Ethereum. Their original and up-to-date specification is in the first CIP: CIP-0001. CIP-0001 was long considered the only necessary document to describe Cardanos standards process. and the history of the material in the cardano-foundation/CIPs GitHub repository (PRs and Issues) was deemed to contain all the knowledge CIP editors and community members would need to understand the CIP process. and by example to write and evaluate new CIPs. Three years from that beginning. the level of community interaction resulting from the CIP process has become more complex and widespread. so the current editors believe the quality of Cardanos standards process will benefit from a higher level description of the process beyond the bare technical requirements outlined in CIP-0001. These pages should always be considered living documents: if readers of any category believe the material needs to be corrected or extended. please file a GitHub Issue so editors can respond to your suggestion.

The document builds on and extends the original Cardano governance scheme that was based on a fixed number of governance keys. It aims to provide a first step that is both valuable and technically achievable in the near term as part of the proposed Voltaire governance system. See rendered version. 2023-06-30 NOTE merged although work will continue on this CIP: see #380 (comment) (continued in #380 (comment)). Please see my proposed legal contribution here: https://forum. org/t/more-legal-framework-for-cip-1694-the-members-based-organization/110573. Overall Im very impressed with and happy with the contents. structure. and work put into the draft CIP-1694. Personally I was considering some similar ideas for governance. however because this isnt my field of expertise my ideas were not nearly as comprehensive. One feature of this CIP that I really like is that there is no mandatory hierarchical structure for how payouts must be made. This leaves funding the future community structure of the (members based organization. professional society. Catalyst startup incubator. whatever outcome of the Cardano constitutional process) entirely flexible. This flexibility is wise and is absolutely necessary for financial (fund/defund) checks-and-balances of future Cardano (organizations/ societies/ companies/ developers/ contractors/ ect). Thank you. Michael. the CIP is deliberately foundational rather than prescribing any specific structure. thanks for all the great suggestions @michaelpj . I\\\\ve just added a commit. address comments 20221122. addressing a lot of it. Im really glad that you suggested the rationale on the table values. as I found a problem. The AVST was not supposed to be ignored when the constitutional committee does not vote. it is required (which is stronger than diverting the responsibility to the SPOs). So now there is a new column in the table. and explanations. Ive added several section to the rationale. Ive left some TODOs. one for the potential other acceptance criterion and one to think more about the treasury voting thresholds (taking @michael-liesenfelt s comments into account). I removed the yes/no ratio remarks that were not correct. I did not yet address any of the comments about the described implementation plan. I will probably need more help understanding those remarks. Hi @jaradcorduan et al. @ltouro suggested that I review your proposal. I’m interested in learning about your CIP. Could you please give me some links where I can read about the background for the idea?. I am interested in reading about your rationale for the model of government that you propose for Cardano.',\n",
       " ' I began drafting a CIP myself that would involve a model of government based fundamentally on a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The draft is available at CIP-x?—I Gave at the Office. Comments are welcome at Cardano Governance #376. I understand some of the challenges associated with creating a stable DAO. see Waves founder: DAOs will never work without fixing governance. I believe that my CIP draft maintains a starting point capable of successfully overcoming such challenges. I have a background in IT as a Technical Writer and Instructional Designer. with a Business Analysis foundation. My graduate research in clinical psychology focussed on investigating social networks within workplaces and organizations using electronic communications. and I hold a related US patent. In response to the concerns expressed by  @Kronoshus regarding doing work for free. I believe that such resentment should not be ignored. Have you considered seeking funding for developing the CIP through Project Catalyst? I would be interested in exploring such an avenue myself. I believe that the timing may be good to apply for the next round of funding. with community voting set to start sometime early in 2023. if I recall correctly. I believe that the Project Catalyst application essentially boils down to an estimate and a schedule. which would be important documents to prepare and maintain for a successful project anyway. in my experience. Oliver. Hi all. Ive just read the CIP-1694 and the comments in this issue. I have some thoughts about them:. I read some comments above which I agree with. I feel that the name of the Constitutional Committee isnt accurate. It should be named something like Governance Committee or something like this. I was thinking about the point 1 and another idea comes to me. Maybe we need an initial Constitutional Committee which creates the constitution and has a grace period to govern with its rules. After this grace period. we would need to revalidate all the members and/or add new ones for the first Governance Committee. I understand that we can remove members of the CC with an action proposal. but it requires someone to do actively an action. Im not comfortable with this situation because this doesnt incentivizes the committee members to participate. and it might cause that they prefer to have a passive role. I think that the membership of the committee should  be revalidated after some time. I hope these points are useful. or at least they spark some debate. Juan. There was a problem hiding this comment. The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others. Learn more. Loved reading this text (three times to understand anything at all). Left a review since I am very interested and personally invested in Cardano. but I dont have much prior experience in governance. so take it for what it is!. Cheers. Im not sure this is a great idea. I think its a good idea in the case of SPOs. since your stake is directly involved in the method of securing the network.',\n",
       " ' but in the case of dReps. that will be voting on issues regarding the future changes to the network. other factors. such as expertise in a given area is IMO more important. Right. if we want a layer 1 solution. we need some way to limit the DReps. Based on economics the number of dReps should be self limiting just based on the tx cost. For most people Im guessing the rewards of a single vote will be much less than the transaction cost to cast that vote. In this way delegating is incentivized. maybe eventually. but at the start there could be a lot of interest that is not financially motivated. and we cant just hope that not too many folks want to vote. I do agree with this. But must the threshold be ADA? As you correctly state. there are no guarantees that this will actually limit the number of representatives. if there are other motives than financial. Maybe if there was a social threshold instead? Or some other kind of proof. like proof of competence. Not sure what that would look like though. Im just thinking out loud here. and I understand such an alternative solution would come with a large iplementation cost/time asociated with it. A dynamic threshold sounds dangerous: it means that theres the possibility of you being pushed out of the top N and then your votes dont count anymore. Youd also need some tooling that tells you if you are in the top N or not. Yeah. transparency is deceased. I agree with that. If the votes are weighted. that would effectively counteract splitting stakes. even with the hard threshold solution. which was the only real point I had against it. Who Chooses N? Should that be one of the items in the constitution? Or should it grow as cardano grows? Should it be a combination of stake pools or producing stake pools and unique active wallets or some other metrics?. @JaredCorduan  Can you please highlight what are the limitations to having an arbitrarily large number of DReps on a layer 1?. ADA holders having to register as a DRep with the deposit intended to be large. reduces the freedom of an ADA holder to register their choices themselves (as in a direct democracy). It would be nice if the governance system could bring in the best of both from direct & representative democracy. Ideally. an ADA holder should have the fundamental right with reasonable restrictions to vote directly or instead delegate to a DRep. Large deposits can make the restrictions unreasonable. I completely understand your concerns and I feel the same way. Unfortunately. the physical reality today is that if we were to end up with. say. 10x the number of DReps as SPOs. and there were several governance actions to vote on each epoch. this would start to take up a very non-trivial amount of the total throughput of Cardano. This may not happen. but we have to be prepared for this (at least at the beginning when there are so many unknowns).',\n",
       " ' Is there a documented business case for CIP-1694? If so. could someone please post the link? I would like to get up to speed as quickly as possible. If information is still being gathered. such as competitive analysis or benchmark studies to compare the strengths and weaknesses of CPI-1694? with those of Cardanos competitors. then I would like to suggest reviewing the PivX DAO (see also Why and How the PIVX DAO Works. for example). Thank you Oliver. I have considered asking for funding yet I still would like some sort of official support by the community or IOG. There are many that do not see the point in creating legal framework and I would like to hear from them because I only ever hear from people that agree with me. If everyone agrees a need for law is necessary then I will go ahead with making a full manual for tribunals. In addition to the need for punitive legal framework in a governance system. someone will also need to make administrative/business law for non-punitive governance actions such as all these nice ideas we love talking about. I am not very good at making legal code around that but a couple of lawyers have reached out to me for that. They just need to have official support from some entity too before writing the code. If law is not created before the governance proposal is implemented. then there will be many issues in the future or people simply will not use the system. call it broken like what happened with Catalyst. and move on with their lives. V/r. Kevin Mohr. In reference to Juans 3rd point here. #380 (comment). He is right. There is no legal procedure to defend oneself if being removed from a committee. thus what incentive would anyone have to do anything once on the committee besides hold power. Thank you @Kronoshus I am going to spend time to read An On-Chain Decentralized Governance Mechanism for Voltaire in detail. The CIP-50 analysis of actual state of Cardano network decentralization has taught one very powerful lesson so far: High leverage is bad. Applying this lesson to social decentralization and governance it would be wise to limit the voting power of all SPOs to some leverage limit multiple of the SPOs pledge: L. This has a profound effect: there is an added social/governance motivation for pledge. Groups like Binance and Coinbase which do not pledge any ADA would have no voting power. On the topic of pledge and leverage. would it be possible to include time duration for pledge existence?  The use of time duration for a pools pledge (i. 10 epochs) could prevent pools from updating their pledge to increase vote impact then remove the pledge to keep their ADA in a more liquid state. @kenricnelson @Quantumplation. The only analogy I have for it was when schools in the US were forced to admit students from all localities of a city. The only problem being there was not way that a kid from a black neighbourhood could actually (using public transport) get to these schools.',\n",
       " ' On paper. yes they had every chance to attend but in practice. the resources needed to utilise their rights were not provided. This freedom is somewhat meaningless (side point: recurring theme in the US. I’d recommend the reader to look up Scandinavian countries and how they view freedom. eg Sweden). What evidence does this design decision rely on?. I’m going to be very honest. I personally don’t care about KYC-ing myself and although I appreciate the cyberpunk ideals. I don’t share them because their intractable. Hence I’m interested in the latter question. I’m pragmatic. Each design decision should solve a problem. I’m not convinced by any means that a governance system ultimately rooted i a token which is highly liquid. it’s owners are pseudonymous and the power is highly concentrated. is “good” in any meaningful sense. The excuse that this is “Minimum Viable Governance” is not good enough because it is a qualitative decision that is likely to have persistent effects. It’s an anchor. The first design is likely to have a sticky effect. analogous to how incumbents in US senate elections have an incumbency advantage (see Cattaneo. Frandsen & Titiunik. 2012). I don’t think any efforts to move away from 1c1v will have any effect at this point. But I would like this raise that this design decision should be explicitly stated as a MAJOR point of discussion that should be revisited X months after implementing MVG and that funds should be allocated to enable competing models to have an actual chance to develop and make the case. The asymmetry between a team within Catalyst headed by a CEO with certain preference paying their salary and a bunch of passionate volunteers taking a few hours off their week doesn’t make this a reasonable comparison. Of course the current CIP-1694 will be in better shape. more eloquent and thought-through. With. a few $10k we consult some of the worlds leading political economists. political scientists and political historians. see what they would come up with. That would be the Cardano way. Best. Simon. Great input @SimonSallstrom ; I hope you can join us today for the ATH discussion. @kenricnelson Unfortunately. I have to work to pay my bills and deliver on the commitments to the hundreds of students I. thanks to the Cardano technology. have committed to help in Kenya and Ethiopia. I am happy to share thoughts asynchronously but the marginal difference/impact my attendance would have on what happens to governance in Cardano is so low that I don’t think this is how I can provide most value to the ecosystem. or the world for that manner. I might swing by for a bit though. we’ll see. Id like to remind everyone about the goals of the CIP process and what the process itself stands for. A CIP is NOT binding anyhow. nor is it any kind of authoritative document that command changes on a project. A CIP is first and foremost. a technical solution to a problem that is thoroughly discussed and backed by arguments.',\n",
       " ' This response is disingenuous. The CIP editor process already conflates Open Source maintainer and editor roles. There is no neutal maintainer here. CIP editors perform both roles - judge and jury. Your statement is also implicitly self-contradictory. By claiming authority What any project maintainer. and in this particular context IOG. does with their code bases is up to them and then also denying it . A CIP isn\\\\t an order or a statement of work etc. This partiality is evident in your subservience . absolutely no desire from the CIP process or us editors to argue against that reality. Your defense that there is no particular rush is self-fulfilling as it depends on our good faith that your merge is not an order or a statement of work. Such good faith is somewhat stretched given the preeminence of code ownership just asserted. Furthermore the availability of a main author is not. in itself. a reason to merge. In fact this circumstance could be precisely a reason not to merge. many months to come forth with a different design and approach. It has taken several months for a wider consultation to occur on this CIP. And the CF consultation has taken the form of workshops that were heavily templated to steer the discussion to the CIP-1694 variables not the overall principles. Many in the community have felt used by this type of shepherding. A large part of the CIP has already been implemented by IOG. Such statements again remind us of the performative nature of this consultation and the disingenuousness of no rush. If there is no rush to merge why defend the merge by citing a mature implementation ?. little chance that the proposal will significantly deviate from the current design unless someone is able to not only propose a new design but also implement it. This appears to be the core of your statement and essentially amounts to take it or leave it. And pre-empts any possible alternative. It very clear where agency lies in this process. Totally agree with all the criticisms raised here. This process feels like a stitch up. because it is a stitch up. it will not work for the purposes of appeasing the SEC. because many people. including myself. will be loudly pointing out how this entire governance proposal has been contrived to give the appearance of increasing decentralisation. when the true effect is just to further consolidate power in the hands of those already at the top. Exactly @kieransimkin !!. I will give credit to IOG for inviting me to the Scotland Workshop despite my vocal critique. Over the past two years. and two months. Ive gone through the following stages:. 2020 - After three years of exploring crypto space decided to focus on Cardanos effort to build a third generation of Crypto culminating in Voltaire Governance. 2021 - Completed Catalyst funded research on voting power; educating the community on the centralizing tendencies of 1c1v and introducing methods of Plural Quadratic Voting. Although there was some opposition mostly it was appreciatively received.',\n",
       " ' 2022 - Supported. though because of time constraints. did not work on Snapbrillias Plural Voting & Funding projects. Their platform is now operational on the Cardano network. The fact that the Federation has made no effort to either integrate this capability into Catalyst or Voltaire. or sponsor a small grant to evaluate the approach. is indicative of the indifference to more decentralized decision-making methods. For F10. Photrek. Snapbrillia. and QA-DAO propose to complete Catalyst Testnet evaluation. At the Colorado Workshop I was stunned by the premise of secrecy and corporate-style voting as a foundation for decentralized governance . I took the view a) further education of the issues and b) discussion of alternatives was the point of having such a workshop. Upon publishing critiques laying out the problems and reiterating the research wed provided earlier. it became clear that defensiveness would be the only response from the Voltaire team. I was reluctant to assign intent. The proforma local workshop agendas helped me understand that discussions of governance principles were not welcome. through side discussions and other venues. there have been rich conversations. The community has helped me understand that only a Democracy in which each DRep has an equal vote can cut through the willful desire for a insecure. corruptible governance. Although Pluralism has important properties. its too complicated to cut through the rush to hand near-dictator power to small group of the wealthiest ADA holders. For the two days of the workshop my focus will be: a) Call a spade a spade: the intent of CIP-1694 is to entrench near dictator status with no regulatory oversight. b) Determine what is required to validate the identities of the DReps now. so they can serve as democratic rather corporate leaders. For those who continue to advocate for CIP-1964. demand the evidence of what the distribution of power will be and explanation why they associate such a distribution with decentralization. from Edinburgh. Scotland. This may explain why there havent been many alternative proposals that have really been fully developed - why bother when its clear the decision has already been made?. Its exactly the same kind of staged public consultation that governments use to make it look like theyre listening when really they are not. In fact this whole proposal stinks of traditional. broken and corrupt politics. the many months to come up with alternative proposals is total nonsense. There have been only a handful of months. which is not even nearly enough time for unpaid volunteers to properly formulate a proposal. This whole proposal stinks. IOG have a massive attitude problem. and they need to start properly taking on feedback from the community instead of hiding in their ivory towers and ignoring their own community. Anyone where free to discuss other topics as well and many solutions where mentioned. In both my workshops quadratic voting and DID solutions where discussed. Most agreed that MVG will not be able to get this in but that it is something we should strive for in the future.',\n",
       " ' I can only speak for the two workshops I did but it was certainly not anything proforma. Yes there was some predetermined suggestions but no they did that did not stop the workshops from discussing a lot of potential solutions. We also saw in Edinburgh we could agree on 3 out of 6 issues and we have more work to do on the 3 others. Just want to mention that I disagree with such strong statements such as Proforma workshops when this is not what I experienced at all. I do however agree with the ambitions of implementing quadratic voting and such voting tools for the right situations where they shine (in particular treasury priorities voting in my opinion). Fair point. and indeed there was a good variety of input from the different workshop hosts. Looks like Optim is the first to start a market for votes:. youtube. com/live/qhG2EiFJrRk?feature=share&t=1472. The mechanism is a smart contract. While this is currently happening in Catalyst. my understanding is that there is no reason this can not be done against CIP-1694 governance. Thats because according to Sabastian of DC Spark. there is no way to differentiate between a smart contract and a user wallet. And so ends Cardanos non-attempt at decentralized governance. The corruption isnt the buying of votes but the mispricing of influence. Because Influence grows quadraticly with votes. the differential value is linear. So the votes held by a small holder are worth less than those held by large holder. the large holder gains more influence than the small holder losses. Centralization is a guaranteed outcome of the mispricing of influence built into any one coin one vote system. Corporations have always been centralized but they have other mechanisms for accountability. None of those accountability mechanisms apply to a non-identity system that fails catastrophically if decentralization is broken. Optim is only the first. There will be many more. In the current form of CIP-1694. it seems the formation of markets for voting delegation is already certainty. In this one respect there is no innovation or departure from all other man made democracies. Evolution implements democracy in the bee colony by delegating voting power to a BRep (scout bee) on each issue rather than delegating for all time. Each BRep investigates the issue and makes a report (waggle dance). com/watch?v=NDnQ4pAjBUg&t=310s. com/watch?v=JnnjY823e-w&t=2309s. Then other BReps investigate and report on the same issue with vigorous debate. When a quorum is reached among the scouts the colony delegates their votes to the issue (not the BReps) by following the quorum for that issue only. Bees do not do KYC. and votes are weighted only by the quality of first hand information. Bees delegate to every issue. and BReps must earn delegation on each and every issue. This is what evolution has figured out about democracy that man is still struggling with. Preventing the buying and selling of delegation is addressed at the following location in Beemocracy. https://github. com/johnshearing/beemocracy#prevent-buying-and-selling-of-delegation. A until this issue of delegation markets is worked out.',\n",
       " ' a strong constitution and the constitutional committee may be the only thing to prevent delegation markets from emptying the treasury. @SimonSallstrom the discovery of the nonlinear growth in influence with votes goes back to the 1950s by Penrose. Banzhoff. and others. Here are a few articles. I also sent you an invite to a Zotero literature database we are maintaining on DAO Governance. Feel free to add articles to this. The mathematical properties are reviewed in Dubey. P. & Shapley. L. Mathematical Properties of the Banzhaf Power Index. Mathematics of OR 4. 99–131 (1979). Square voting system: Slomczynski. W. & Zyczkowski. K. Penrose voting system and optimal quota. Preprint at http://arxiv. org/abs/physics/0610271 (2006). Glen Weyl and Eric Posner are the inventors of Quadratic Voting. They have many publications. including an excellent book. Radical Markets. This was discusses the history of voting. Posner. E. A. & Weyl. G. Voting Squared: Quadratic Voting in Democratic Politics. This paragraph from Posner. gives a good description of the dangers of majority rule. including corporate systems were votes are weighted by shares or coins. But there are good reasons to be worried about tyranny of the majority. The first reason is that majority rule. unless constrained to prevent tyranny of the majority. will not necessarily advance the public good. Majority rule can lead to the systematic transfer of wealth or resources from a minority to the majority. From the standpoint of the public interest. such systematic transfers are sometimes justified (for example. transfers from rich to poor). but they need not be. nothing about majority rule guarantees that such transfers will promote public well-being. The transfers may go from one morally arbitrary group to another-for example. election winners to election losers. or poorer people to wealthier people. or black people to white people. Often these transfers incur substantial waste both administratively and in separating goods from the owners that most value them. 5 Moreover. because the harm from being trapped in a minority is so great. people will struggle to form coalitions that constitute a majority. a high-stakes game that consumes time and resources that could be more productively spent elsewhere. Hi community. Hope this comment finds you!. I am deeply concerned about this. I am an early adopter and I have been with the community a very long time. I love Cardano and its vision. I also love Charles and what he stands for. My main concern is that we go without constitution in the Voltaire-Phase. but this looks very. very naive to me. We have a principal’s approach. we have all science-papers peer reviewed. we take our time to program a rock solid blockchain. we use Haskell which was a awful lot of work and we take our time to build a blockchain which could last for ages. and we want to be the financial back bone of the world.

Addition of language that allows for SPOs to delegate to pre-defined voting options. PR created by Adam Rusch and Johnny Kelly. Idea for achieving SPO pre-defined voting options came from Martin Lang of ATADA Stake Pool at the September 23. 2024 Ledger Working Group meeting. Here is the ticket on the Ledger side that goes into some reasons and outlines more specifics of this change: IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger#4645. Cross referencing it for anyone interested in following progress on implementation of this feature. I second that PR by saying. Thats about time! 😅🥰👍. The total active voting stake for SPOs usually doesn’t include Auto-Abstain in the calculations for any governance actions. including hard fork governance. Since hard forks will not include Auto-Abstain and No-Confidence voting options. wouldn’t it be better to rephrase this with the assumption that we are effectively discussing active stake delegated to stake pools. rather than just the active stake that has voted?. Same here. To dispel confusion about what constitutes active voting stake for SPOs. its important to note that the Auto-Abstain voting option is typically not included in the active voting stake calculations.',\n",
       " ' while Auto-No-Confidence is. Should we add some additional clarifications regarding the hard fork exception?. The SPOs relationship to the Automated Voting Options being added as a Note after the Automated Voting Options section is placed to dovetail off of the existing explanations of how these options affect the Active Voting Stake. I wont be at the next CIP meeting when this is introduced (https://hackmd. io/@cip-editors/98). but just in case its undisputed & perhaps can be merged there. Im endorsing this in advance due to the approval of the Ledger team & governance advocates. hello!. Thanks for the pull request @adamrusch and team. I am a fan of this. Changing active CIPs once marked as active has proven to cause compatibly issues. Tooling claiming to be CIP-1694 compliant will no longer be. May I suggest that we change this to be its own proposal (I know it will be brief) but I feel this will make tracking compatibility much easier. @Ryun1 Id like to argue against your suggestion. Technically CIP-1694 is not yet fully active. It will only be active after the bootstrap phase is over with Chang+1 HF. which is exactly when the full CIP-1694 goes into affect. This feature that is being described in the PR is something that is currently being implemented for the Chang+1 HF in Ledger. if we do this change in a separate CIP. technically then ledger will not be CIP-1694 compatible 😉. We also discussed this on a call and @disassembler and @kevinhammond also made the same suggestion: just amend the existing CIP-1694. I see that a separate CIP is not necessary. but I want to guard against inconsistencies with this change to CIP 1694. Are you sure that the suggested changes cover all things that should change?. is line 722 still correctly formulated?. I believe line 722 is indeed correctly formulated. That being said. I suggested more clarification in this comment (on line 521):. #916 (comment). I believe line 494 and 521 should probably be revised. As it is currently written. it suggests that the thresholds for hard forks are exempt from being calculated based on active voting stake.  In reality. even for a hard fork. its still necessary to meet a threshold of active voting stakes. The only exceptions are the exemption of auto-abstain and auto No-confidence voting options regarding Hard-fork initiation governance action. @Hornan7 :). And for completeness. do you think we should add some line from this issue for context somewhere in the CIP?. I think Johnny Kelly and Adam Rusch did a great job with this PR. It summarizes the changes to the ledger well in the CIP-1694. though I believe the part mentioned above could be slightly modified. 😇. @lehins. My main motivation for wanting this in its own proposal is for communication reasons. It is a lot simpler to communicate heads up new Ledger CIP-???? rather than CIP-1694 is changing again. Having this change in its own proposal. gives the authors a chance to fully describe the motivation and rationale for this making communicating easier.',\n",
       " ' Furthermore much tooling has considered itself CIP1694 compliant. having tested across different networks with and without bootstrapping. Changing CIP1694 will now mean these tools are not compliant. and it is a challenge to reach out to all these tools to let them know. Anyway. seems like the sentiment is against me on this one 😆. If this is to stay as a change to CIP1694. I must request a few changes. cc @adamrusch. While I appreciate your perspective on the benefits of creating a separate CIP. I believe it is crucial to maintain and update CIP-1694 instead. This document serves as the official key reference for how Cardanos governance features operate at the protocol level and is integral to our governance framework. The CIP-1694 is also referenced multiple times in the Interim Constitution:. Appendix 1 - Cardano Guardrails Introduction: This section states that implementing on-chain governance requires establishing guardrails based on CIP-1694 to ensure the Cardano Blockchain operates securely and sustainably. Guardrail 2. 5 - Governance Parameters: This section emphasizes that the goals of managing governance parameters include ensuring governance stability and maintaining a representative form of governance as outlined in CIP-1694. Guardrail Script 9: CIP-1694 is cited multiple times within this section. reinforcing its role as a foundational document for governance practices during the Interim Period. Given that the CIP-1694 is already established as the main reference point in the Interim Constitution. creating a new CIP for this change would imply significant modifications to the Constitution itself to incorporate this new reference. This could lead to confusion and misalignment within our governance framework if these changes are not done concurrently in both documents. As Alexei mentioned. we are still in the bootstrap phase. which is why I also believe we should prioritize updates to CIP-1694 to ensure it accurately reflects our governance processes. 😃👍. Im sorry for not contributing much so far beyond agreeing with the points everyone is making on both sides. I can see how a trail of distinct CIPs documenting any changes to the baseline would be important as @Ryun1 is saying. I also can see why its necessary at this point to confine the sum of this behaviour to CIP-1694 alone. as a special case beyond this generally desirable process. because of CIP-1694s uniquely defined & comprehensive role. I think what @Ryun1 offers in #916 (comment) would be an excellent compromise — to rationalise and record this update within CIP-1694 itself — and to follow this precedent for any similar updates until some evolutionary change might break that uniquely intimate relationship between CIP-1694 and the overall Governance process. @adamrusch - consensus at CIP meeting today is that we only await updating as per #916 (comment) before double-checking the added rationale / changelog & then hitting the merge button for this. I believe it would be sufficient to add this pull request as an additional link in the discussion section of the header which can be accomplished via a separate housekeeping PR. intertreeJK. intertreeJK left review comments.',\n",

Cardano is built by a decentralized community of scientists. engineers. and thought leaders united in a common               purpose: to create a technology platform that will ignite the positive change the world needs. We believe the future               should not be defined by the past. and that more is possible - and. through technology. can be made possible for all. We measure the worth of a task not by its challenge. but by its results. Every ada holder also holds a stake in the Cardano network. Ada stored in a wallet can be delegated to a stake pool               to earn rewards – to participate in the successful running of the network – or pledged to a stake pool to increase the               pool’s likelihood of receiving rewards.

It takes us from where we’ve been to where we’re destined to go: a global society that                   is secure. and fair. and which serves the many as well as the few. Like the technological revolutions that                   have come before. it offers a new template for how we work. interact. and create. as individuals. businesses. and                   societies. Cardano began with a vision of a world without intermediaries. in which power is not controlled by an accountable few.                 but by the empowered many. In this world. individuals have control over their data and how they interact and transact. Businesses have the opportunity to grow independent of monopolistic and bureaucratic power structures. Societies are able                 to pursue true democracy: self-governing. fair. and accountable. It is a world made possible by Cardano. From the incremental to global. Cardano improves how we interact. transact. and create - and ultimately operate as a                   global society. Cardano is a blockchain platform built on the groundbreaking Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus protocol. and developed                   using the Haskell programming language: a functional programming language that enables Cardano to pursue evidence-based                   development. for unparalleled security and stability. Our technology is underpinned by research. We have redefined what it means to create a global software platform through                   scientific methods.',\n",

A cryptocurrency wallet is a software program designed to store your public and private keys. send and receive digital currencies.           monitor your balance. and interact with supported blockchains. In addition to the variation of wallets available. there are also two types of wallets: a hot wallet and a cold wallet. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and can be accessed at any time with the requisite keys. Examples of hot wallets include mobile and software wallets. and funds stored on exchanges. A cold wallet is an offline wallet. It is not connected to the internet and is used for securing storing funds that do not have to be frequently accessed. Examples include hardware wallets - which is a secure hardware device that stores the wallet’s private keys - and paper wallets. Cardano is supported by both Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets.There are many ways to obtain ada to use the Cardano blockchain. Before receiving or buying ada. you need to set up a Cardano wallet. Once you have a Cardano wallet. all you need to do is share your address to start sending and receiving ada (and other native tokens) peer-to-peer. Some wallets let you purchase crypto with a debit/credit card. bank transfer. or Apple Pay. Availability depends on your location. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) are platforms where cryptocurrencies and other digital assets are traded. They act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers.',\n",

Note that CEXs have custody over ada  and other native tokens until you send them to a wallet that you control. Listing here does not imply endorsement. Visit CoinMarketCap to see a full list of exchanges that support ada. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are platforms for trading cryptocurrencies that operate without a central authority. They allow users to trade directly with each other (peer-to-peer) through automated processes facilitated by smart contracts. This approach enhances security and privacy. reducing the risk of hacking and custodial failures associated with centralized exchanges. DEXs are not suitable for beginners. as you must already have ada to use them. Visit the Cardano Showcase to get a more complete list of available decentralized exchanges. Discover Cardano’s innovation fund designed to support groundbreaking projects and ideas. By participating. you can receive ada funding to bring your vision to life. Visit Project Catalyst and learn how to create a proposal. If you already have some ada. you can earn more by delegating your ada to a stake pool. This allows you to participate in the network’s proof-of-stake system and earn rewards. you can run your own stake pool. which requires more effort and technical knowledge but can be more rewarding. Cardano offers several advantages for staking: there is no minimum amount of ada required to stake. no risk of slashing (losing your staked ada). and no locking period. You always maintain custody over your delegated ada. ensuring that your funds remain secure and accessible at all times. rewards are distributed by the protocol itself. not by the pools. ensuring a fair and transparent distribution process.The cryptocurrency space is full of opportunities. but it’s also a playground for scammers. The cryptocurrency space is full of opportunities. Cardano (ada). one of the most popular blockchains. isn’t immune to these threats. From fake giveaways to phishing attacks. scammers are constantly innovating new ways to exploit users. As artificial intelligence continues to improve. these scams are also becoming more sophisticated. This page outlines the most common scams in the Cardano ecosystem and how you can protect yourself. Remember: If someone gains access to your seed words (recovery phrase). they can take full control of your wallet—no spending password can protect you. Once your ada is stolen. it’s gone forever. with no way to recover it. One of the most well-known scams targeting the Cardano community is the Ada Giveaway Scam. Scammers promise to double your ada if you send them a certain amount first. These scams often feature fake live streams of Charles Hoskinson. or other well-known personalities. to appear legitimate. The streams may mimic genuine events and include a wallet address for you to send your ada. How to protect yourself:. Phishing scams involve fake websites. apps or emails designed to steal sensitive information. such as your wallet credentials or recovery phrase (seed words). These fraudulent sites often mimic popular wallets like Typhon. VESPR or Eternl.',\n",
       " ' Fraudulent investment schemes are another popular scam. Scammers promote fake projects. claiming they are “Cardano-backed” or “ada-specific” opportunities with guaranteed high returns. Victims are urged to send ada or other funds to a provided wallet address. with promises of earning exponential profits. In this scam. fraudsters pose as “official“ Cardano support representatives. They often reach out via social media. forums. or email. claiming they can fix your wallet or troubleshoot an issue. They also often copy the profiles of real moderators and to “help.” they’ll ask for your recovery phrase (seed words) or private keys. Cardano is a public. permissionless Layer 1 blockchain and everyone can use it. Some fraudulent projects launch on Cardano. gaining attention with big promises and flashy marketing. After collecting a significant amount of ada from investors. these projects disappear—this is known as a “rug pull.See how much you could potentially earn by staking ada and learn how rewards are calculated. The Cardano Foundation is not responsible for any differences between estimated and actual rewards. This calculator is for guidance purposes only.To build the network. earn rewards. and become part of the Cardano journey. Ada held on the Cardano network represents a stake in the network. with the size of the stake proportional to                 the amount of ada held. The ability to delegate or pledge a stake is fundamental to how Cardano works. There are two ways an ada holder can earn rewards: by delegating their stake to a stake pool run by someone else.                 or running their own stake pool. The amount of stake delegated to a given stake pool is the primary way the Ouroboros                 protocol chooses who should add the next block to the blockchain. and receive a monetary reward for doing so. The more stake is delegated to a stake pool (up to a certain point). the more likely it is to make the next block –                 and the rewards are shared between everyone who delegated their stake to that stake pool. Delegation is the process by which ada holders delegate the stake associated with their ada to a stake pool. It                 allows ada holders that do not have the skills or desire to run a node to participate in the network and be rewarded                 in proportion to the amount of stake delegated. Incentives are used to ensure the longevity and health of the Cardano network and ecosystem. The incentive mechanism                 is underpinned by scientific research that combines mathematics. economic theory. Discover a wide variety of wallets designed to facilitate your interaction with the Cardano ecosystem.Become a stake pool operator. earn ada. and contribute to the decentralization of the Cardano network.                 or by running their own stake pool. The amount of stake delegated to a given stake pool is the primary way the Ouroboros protocol chooses who should                 add the next block to the blockchain. the more likely it is to make the next block                 – and the rewards that it earns are shared between everyone who delegated their stake to that stake pool.',\n",
       " ' Stake pools may be either public or private. A public stake pool is a Cardano network node with a public address that                 other users can delegate to. and receive rewards. Private stake pools only deliver rewards to their owners. Stake pools are run by a reliable operator: an individual or business with the knowledge and resources to run the node                 on a consistent basis. Ada holders can delegate to public stake pools if they wish to participate in the protocol and                 receive rewards. but do not wish to operate a Cardano network node themselves. The more stake that is delegated to a stake pool. the greater chance it has of being selected as a slot leader. Each                 time it is selected and produces a block that is accepted onto the blockchain. it is rewarded. and these rewards are                 shared between the stake pool operator and stake pool delegators. Extensive research and development has gone into ensuring a fair. competitive marketplace that proportionately incentivizes                 participation. and rewards the investment of time. energy. and resources. The key technical parameters influencing stake                 pools and the rewards received are:. While there is no required minimum pledge amount. pool operators can optionally pledge some or all of their stake               to their pool to make their pool more attractive. The higher the amount of ada pledged. the more rewards the pool will               receive. which will attract more delegation. The a0 protocol parameter defines the influence of the pledge on the pool reward. The desirability of a pool is calculated by taking the pledged owner’s stake. costs. and margin. and combining them with                 an influence from saturation and pool performance. This number will be used to rank pools in wallets. and indicates how                 ‘desirable’ or ‘attractive’ the pool is to potential delegators. Saturation is a term used to indicate that a particular stake pool has more stake delegated to it than is ideal for the                 network. while k is the targeted number of desired pools. Once a pool reaches the point of saturation. it will offer                 diminishing rewards. The saturation mechanism was designed to prevent centralization by encouraging delegators to                 delegate to different stake pools. and to incentivize operators to set up alternative pools so that they can continue                 earning maximum rewards. Saturation. exists to preserve the interests of both ada holders delegating their                 stake and stake pool operators. and to prevent any single pool from becoming too large. It’s important to remember the role of a stake pool operator: to ensure reliable. 24/7 operation of a network node. As a stake pool operator. you have a responsibility to the ada holders who delegate to you but also to the health of the network itself. This requires a stable and reliable network infrastructure and. ideally. system operation and server administration skills along with experience in development and operations. Anybody can learn how to operate a stake pool. but a degree of technical familiarity and knowledge is required.Cardano is developing the most secure and decentralized governance model in the world.',\n",
       " ' A model to give everybody a voice. and control over the future development of the platform and the applications and services that emerge from it. Cardano is defined by its community. Its governance model shows that true democracy - in which individuals are incentivized to play a role and votes are immutably recorded - is possible. It is a way for token holders to decide the future of a platform. and for the community to dictate the use of Cardano’s treasury funds. This model and the pioneering technology that underpins it can be applied to any application. system. or even society. It is a blueprint for change that is decided by the many. and which will redistribute power. eliminating intermediaries. to improve the lives of all. Change begins with one voice. But is realized through the Combination of many. Delegation is the act of lending your voting power—equal to the ada balance in your wallet—to a Delegate Representative (DRep). who votes on your behalf like a parliamentary representative. you can use automatic voting options to abstain or signal “No Confidence” in all proposals. DReps are key participants in governing the Cardano network. They actively engage in governance and represent other Cardano members. DReps must stay informed on governance actions to make wise decisions. If you have the time and commitment to contribute to Cardano’s governance. register as a DRep. A refundable deposit of 500 ada is required and will be returned upon retirement. Stay informed and participate in Cardano’s decentralized governance.

A better. more positive future is possible. If the world is to serve the many. it must be agreed to by the many. Consensus must drive progress and where disagreement occurs. it must drive creative solutions. Decentralization begins with the technology - with Shelley - but is only truly achieved when no single entity is in control. The governing principle of decentralization is the redistribution of control: global networks that are defined not from the middle. but by every participant. This is the purpose of Voltaire. Voltaire adds the ability for the Cardano community to make impactful decisions about software updates. technical improvements and funding decisions. Known as Governance Actions. these allow the future of Cardano to be determined by its community and funded from the platforms treasury. The era will also play host to a series of experiments. as we discuss topics such as decentralised governance. the dynamics of democracy and consent. evolving Voltaire from research to reality. If Shelley was the foundation of a globally coordinated network without a central authority. then Voltaire will explore the apparatus for shared decision making: the language of decentralization.An environmentally sustainable. verifiably secure proof-of-stake protocol with rigorous security guarantees.',\n",
       " ' A proof-of-stake protocol that provides and improves the security guarantees of proof-of-work at a fraction of the energy cost. Ouroboros applies cryptography. combinatorics. and mathematical game theory to guarantee the protocol’s integrity. longevity. and performance. and that of the distributed networks that depend upon it. Ouroboros is the first provably secure proof-of-stake protocol. and the first blockchain protocol to be based on               peer-reviewed research. Ouroboros combines unique technology and mathematically-verified mechanisms - which.               combine behavioral psychology and economic philosophy - to ensure the security and sustainability of the blockchains               that depend upon it. The result is a protocol with proven security guarantees able to facilitate the propagation of               global. permissionless networks with minimal energy requirements - of which Cardano is the first. At the heart of Ouroboros is the concept of infinity. Global networks must be able to grow sustainably and ethically:               to provide greater opportunities to the world while also preserving it. This becomes possible with Ouroboros. Ouroboros facilitates the creation and fruition of distributed. permissionless networks capable of sustainably supporting               new markets. Ouroboros features mathematically verifiable security against attackers. The protocol is guaranteed to be secure so long as 51% of the stake – in the case of Cardano. ada – is held by honest                   participants. which. in addition to other novel concepts. is achieved through random leader selection. The protocol continues                   to evolve through new iterations and rigorous security analysis. To ensure the sustainability of the blockchain networks using Ouroboros. the protocol features an incentive mechanism that                   rewards network participants for their participation. This can either be operating a stake pool or delegating a stake in ada to a stake pool. Rewards (in the form of ada) can be                   earned by completing either of these activities. Ouroboros is a proof-of-stake protocol. It distributes network control across stake pools: node operators with the infrastructure                   required to ensure a consistent and reliable connection to the network. For each slot. a stake pool is assigned as the slot leader. and is rewarded for adding a block to the chain. Ada holders may delegate                   their stake to a specific stake pool. increasing its chance of being selected as the slot leader. and share in the stake pool’s rewards. Ouroboros solves the greatest challenge faced by existing blockchains: the need for more and more energy to achieve consensus. Using                   Ouroboros. Cardano is able to securely. sustainably. and ethically scale. with up to four million times the energy efficiency of bitcoin. There are two main blockchain protocols: proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-work (PoW). These protocols are consensus             algorithms for distributed networks: rulesets that dictate how networks – made up of thousands of nodes – agree on             new additions (blocks) in a permissionless setting. Proof-of-work is the blockchain protocol used by bitcoin. Proof-of-work began a revolution: it enabled the creation of               secure. permissionless. distributed networks. But to achieve consensus for each new block. proof-of-work requires an               enormous amount of energy: an amount so large that the supported blockchains struggle to sustain and scale to the               performance requirements of global networks.',\n",
       " ' Proof-of-stake answers the performance and energy-use challenges of proof-of-work. and arrives at a more sustainable             solution. Instead of relying on miners to solve computationally complex equations to create new blocks – and rewarding             the first to do so – proof of stake selects participants (in the case of Cardano. stake pools) to create new blocks based             on the stake they control in the network. This enables networks to scale horizontally. increasing performance by incorporating additional nodes. rather than               vertically. through the addition of more powerful hardware. The resulting difference in energy use can be analogized               to that between a household and a small country. PoS is positioned scale to the mass market; PoW is not. Ouroboros processes transaction blocks by dividing chains into epochs. which are further divided into time slots. A slot leader is elected for each time slot and is responsible for adding a block to the chain. To protect against               adversarial attempts to subvert the protocol. each new slot leader is required to consider the last few blocks of the               received chain as transient: only the chain that precedes a prespecified number of transient blocks is considered               settled. This is also referred to as the settlement delay. and is the mechanism through which the ledger is securely               passed between participants. Ouroboros is a meld of innovative technology and philosophy. Its research explores how we behave as a society.               to discover an ideal balance - defined through game theory - between individual and collective interests. Ouroboros’ incentive mechanism rewards participants for their honest participation. and disincentivizes dishonest               actors. It is a stable and sustainable foundation for permission networks that are built to endure: the infrastructure               of the future.What hard forks were implemented. and what functionalities did they introduce?. Hard forks in Cardano do not signify division and differences within the ecosystem. On the contrary. they define a specific and collectively agreed-upon exact time (slot) when all nodes switch from the current era to a new one. applying new functions. validation rules. or parameter values. All stake pool operators need to install the upgrade. and they also have a say and must agree to it. A Cardano hard fork is. not a separation but a precise collective evolution. Note that some hard forks. particularly Byron and Shelley. transitioned through a series of updates and may not have a single specific transaction id associated with them. For the others. the provided transaction ids correspond to significant parameter updates leading to the hard forks.Distribution of ada token vouchers. which are part of the Cardano settlement layer.  took place in Asia in four stages between October 2015 and the start of January 2017. The initial distribution of ada. essentially a pre-launch sales event. was the first in the cryptocurrency industry to               set Know Your Customer guidelines. and an audit was performed on the distribution process. Information and statistics               about the voucher distribution are detailed below in the Ada Voucher Distribution Stats section. In addition to these ada. the Genesis Block Distribution includes an amount equal to 20% of the ada vouchers sold during               the Sale period.',\n",

The sum taken during each tranche is viewable in Bitcoin. ada or the equivalent in US dollars. (All ada voucher holder transactions were made in Bitcoin. or by Yen converted into Bitcoin. to enable transparent               blockchain accounting. ) The proportion of ada voucher holders from each region is shown. along with the average               size of vouchers held. and there is also information on distributors. From September 2015 to January 2017 a pre-launch sales event of cryptocurrency token ada was undertaken. The sales event           covered five specific periods. referred to as ‘tranches’ (T1/T2/T3/T3. 5/T4). The principal party retained Attain Corporation           of Japan to manage the sale of ada ‘vouchers’ that could be exchanged into ada tokens after the platform launch. Subsequently.           the Cardano Foundation performed three separate audits into the sales operation. These audits were a bespoke hybrid of operational           and financial audit approaches. The first audit covered T1 & T2. the second covered T3/T3. 5 and the third covered T4.           an overall summary document was created. The core task was to produce an objective study of how sales were progressing and to           check on adherence to contractual terms between the parties. The Cardano Foundation interviewed representatives of Attain           Corporation both in the UK and Japan. It has had full independent access to the source data. Where appropriate. the Cardano           Foundation offered its best advice to improve processes and internal operations. Each audit had the same broad scope:. The sale proceeds were entirely in bitcoin. although some purchases were exchanged from Yen to Bitcoin as part of the sales           transaction process. Cardano Foundation’s findings were as follows:. Proceeds of Sale Review Cardano Foundation performed a full comparison between sales reported on Attain’s internal sales           database and compared that to the amounts received at the end of the process. Transparent sale accounting was enabled by use of           the publically available bitcoin ‘blockchain’ to process sales and receipts. This information could therefore be ratified against           accounting entries in Attain’s sales database. This comparison gave the Cardano Foundation a high degree of confidence that the           sales proceeds had been reported in a full and fair manner.',\n",
       " ' The final total of bitcoins received and visible on the blockchain           agreed with the total bitcoin reported in Attains Sales database agreed with an error margin of less than 0. 01%. Perform a Customer Sales Analysis Cardano Foundation looked at sales patterns and searched for inconsistencies in the data. During the first audit. which covered the first two sales tranches. some cases were identified where distributors were purchasing           on behalf of customers. This meant their customers were not being onboarded with the necessary KYC checks. Cardano Foundation           reported they saw evidence that these distributors were subsequently suspended from further trading and observed that considerable           effort was applied to ensure these individual purchasers were onboarded or refunded. Perform a Distributor Activity Analysis Cardano Foundation did not find any material issues of concern with the distributors           general activity. other than reported above. Check for Know Your Customer (KYC) standards adherence Cardano Foundation reported that they believed this is the first time a           cryptocurrency offering has required KYC in order to participate both as a purchaser and/or distributor. In this regard. the sale           is industry leading and goes significantly beyond other cryptocurrency offerings to ensure a good source of funds for the project. During the first and second tranches. Cardano Foundation reported some failings in the KYC onboarding process. such as missing           documents or inconsistent data. Attain demonstrated that they worked to correct these earlier errors and tighten the procedures in           later sales tranches. Cardano Foundation report that the KYC adherence for purchasers improved significantly as the sales tranches           progressed. The KYC adherence results were particularly strong in tranche 4. demonstrating improved rigour in operational practices           as Attains level of experience in managing this process grew. Review of Attain as an entity Cardano Foundation reported that. in their view. Attain had demonstrated an awareness of their           obligations and duties of care and have well established operational procedures performed by a dedicated team. Below are the sales statistics Cardano Foundation reported in the final audit. updated to include refunds processed and final           database reconciliations;. Below tables shows the total sales summary for all tranches:.The Cardano community consists of people from all over the world. who have come together to grow and safeguard the spirit and the future of Cardano.

Cardano Problem Statements.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0and\\\\xa0Michael Peyton Jones.This Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) introduces a standardized and flexible metadata format for governance events in the Cardano ecosystem. While the ledger does not enforce the structure of metadata. providing a standard for metadata will enable better tooling. improved interoperability. and more consistent display across wallets. blockchain explorers. and other tools. This CIP aims to strike a balance between flexibility and structure to facilitate high-quality tooling. without limiting expressivity with regards to user expression. With the advent of the Voltaire era. Cardano is moving towards a decentralized governance model.',\n",
       " ' CIP-1694 addresses a potential technical implementation of ledger rules for creating. voting on. and ratifying proposed changes to the ledger. The ledger has no mechanism or desire to validate this metadata. and as a result. the official specification leaves the format of this metadata unspecified. To facilitate rich user experiences for the various governance actors. it would be beneficial to have a suggested universal format for this metadata. allowing deep and interconnected discovery and exploration of this metadata. This CIP seeks to provide that standard format. and a minimal set of fields for various governance actions. leaving the true depth of metadata to be defined later through the extensibility mechanism outlined below. While this specification is written with CIP-1694 in mind. many of the ideas should be equally suitable for any other governance proposal. provided that proposal has a mechanism for attaching metadata to a governance action. Explicitly. here are the goals this CIP is trying to satisfy:. This section outlines the high level format and requirements of this standard. JSON-LD is a standard for describing interconnected JSON documents that use a shared vocabulary. In a JSON-LD document. every field is uniquely tied to some globally unique identifier by means of an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI). Different machine-consumers can then know that they agree on the interpretation of these fields. The shared vocabulary of fields is standardized within the scope of a document via a @context field. This allows a compositional / extensible approach to versioning. similar to the recent changes to CIP-0030. Rather than specifying a version number and forcing competing standards to compete for what the next version number will include. instead a wide variety of standards are allowed and encouraged. Tool authors MAY support those which are the most beneficial or common. This creates an organic. collaborative evolution of the standard. Note: Any URIs in the @context field SHOULD be content-addressable and robustly hosted; losing access to the schema is less dangerous than losing access to the metadata itself. but should still prefer strong and immutable storage options for the preservation of context. Extensions to the governance metadata standard can take one of two forms:. In CIP-1694 (and likely any alternative or future evolution of it). there are a number of certificates that can be attached to a transaction pertaining to governance; each of these is equipped with an anchor. which is a URI at which can be found additional metadata. While this metadata can be published anywhere. external hosting may be unavailable to some users. we recognize the transaction metadata as an effective tool for a common town square for hosting and discoverability. and reserve metadatum label 1694 for publishing governance related metadata on-chain. With the help of CIP-?. the anchor can then refer to the metadata of another transaction. or even the metadata of the transaction being published itself. When published on-chain. the CBOR encoding of this metadata. when published on-chain. follows the standard convention used for converting JSON to CBOR in transaction metadata. someone may wish to augment a previous piece of metadata with new information.',\n",
       " ' divorced from the transaction that initially published it; this may be useful. provide additional arguments in favor of or against a proposal. provide translations to other languages. provide a laymans explanation of a highly technical document. These use the same format. but leverage the references field to point to the documents that they wish to extend. These can. in theory. be published anywhere. but the use of metadatum label 1694 mentioned above is particularly useful in this case. We expect a rich ecosystem of CIPs to emerge defining different extensions. so this CIP provides only an initial base-line MVP of fields. defined in the following JSON-LD and JSON Schema files:. The rest of this document will provide a high level description of how these fields should be interpreted. The following properties are considered common to all types of transactions. and the minimal set needed for minimum viable governance:. we highlight the following concepts native to json-ld that are useful in the context of governance metadata:. When publishing a governance action. the certificate has an anchor. defined as a URI and a hash of the content at the URI. For CIP-0100 compliant metadata. the hash in the anchor should be the blake2b-256 hash of the raw bytes received from the wire. Hashing directly the original bytes ensures that there are no ambiguities. since the process doesnt depend on parsing the metadata. which can be the source of conflicts in different implementations. A metadata has a number of authors. each of which MUST authenticate their endorsement of the document in some way. This is left extensible. through the use of a new context. but for the purposes of this CIP. we provide a simple scheme. Each author should have a witness. The witness will be an object with an witnessAlgorithm (set to ed25519). a publicKey (set to a base-16 encoded ed25519 public key). and a signature. set to the base-16 encoded signature of the body field. Because the overall document may change. it is neccesary to hash a subset of the document that is known before any signatures are collected. This is the motivation behind the body field. The signature is an ed25519 signature using the attached public key. and the payload set to the blake2b-256 hash of the body field. this field is canonicalized in the following way. This section outlines a number of other best practices for tools and user experiences built on top of this standard. as brainstormed by the Cardano community. Here are the goals this CIP seeks to achieve. and the rationale for how this specific solution accomplishes them:. The following alternatives were considered. and rejected:. See test-vector. md for example. The path for this proposal to be considered active within the community focuses on 4 key stages: Feedback. Implementation. Adoption. and Extension. In order for this standard to be active. the following should be true:. Below you can find a growing list of community tools which let you sign / verify / canonize / manipulate governance metadata JSON-LD data:.',\n",
       " ' The key stages to get this proposal to active. and the motivation for why each stage is valuable. is outlined below:.

Some of these artifacts support the linking off-chain metadata. as a way to provide context.',\n",
       " ' The CIP-100 | Governance Metadata standard provides a base framework for how all off-chain governance metadata should be formed and handled. But this is intentionally limited in scope. so that it can be expanded upon by more specific subsequent CIPs. This proposal aims to provide a specification for off-chain metadata vocabulary that can be used to give context to governance actions. Without a sufficiently detailed standard for governance actions we introduce the possibility to undermine voters ability to adequately assess governance actions. Furthermore a lack of such standards risks preventing interoperability between tools. to the detriment of user experiences. Blockchains are poor choices to act as content databases. This is why governance metadata anchors were chosen to provide a way to attach long form metadata content to on-chain events. By only supplying an onchain hash of the off-chain we ensure correctness of data whilst minimizing the amount of data posted to the chain. When observing from the chain level. tooling can only see the content of the governance action and its anchor. These on-chain components do not give give any context to the motivation nor off-chain discussion of an governance action. Although this information would likely be desired context for voters. By providing rich contextual metadata we enable voters to make well informed decisions. By standardizing off-chain metadata formats we facilitate interoperability for tooling which creates and/or renders metadata attached to governance actions. This intern promotes a rich user experience between tooling. This is good for all governance participants. Although there are seven types of governance action defined via CIP-1694. we focus this proposal on defining core properties which must be attached to all types. We leave room for future standards to refine and specialize further to cater more specific for each type of governance action. Here we extend the potential witnesses. with a witnessAlgorithm that can be set to include support for CIP-08 | Message Signing standard. indicated by CIP-0008. Here we mimic the restrictions as imposed over the CIP-30s implementation in. signData(). This standard introduces the possibility of using Github markdown text styling within fields. The following properties extend the potential vocabulary of CIP-100s body property. Governance action metadata must include all compulsory fields to be considered CIP-0108 compliant. As this is an extension to CIP-100. all CIP-100 fields can be included within CIP-108 compliant metadata. md for examples. This proposal should not be versioned. to update this standard a new CIP should be proposed. Although through the JSON-LD mechanism further CIPs can add to the common governance metadata vocabulary. We intentionally have kept this proposal brief and uncomplicated. This was to reduce the time to develop and deploy this standard. We think it is better to have a base standard which can be improved. rather than meticulously craft a perfect single standard. This way we enable tooling which depends on this standard to start development. it is very difficult to predict future wants/needs now. so by allowing upgrades we build in the ability to improve the standard as new wants/needs arrive.',\n",
       " ' The fields which have been chosen for this standard heavily inspired to those used for CIPs. We did this for two reasons; familiarity and competency. Those who are involved in Cardano are familiar with the CIP format. meaning they will be intuitively understand these fields being reused here. These fields in combination have also been fairly battle tested via the CIPs process and thus act as a good standard to describe problems and their solutions. We introduce a new witness type to be able to reuse existing dApp-Wallet infrastructure. The type as described allows for reuse of the CIP-30 signData standard. which means that governance dApps are able to implement this without needing any alterations to existing wallets. We choose to introduce rich text standard here because we see significant value in supporting it. Rich text styling improves the ability for the author to express themselves. most potential voters are use to such standards when reviewing metadata. With this design. we wanted to allow for quick and easy differentiation between governance actions. We achieve this by facilitating users layers of investigation. where some fields are limited in size. This encourages tooling providers to show users the small fields before allowing deep investigation of the larger fields. By allowing this we aim to improve the experience of prospective voters. when sorting though many governance actions. The downside of highlighting some fields over others is that we incentivize hyperbolic and eye catching phrases. Where authors want their governance action to standout in tooling so use overly dramatic phrasing. This creates an environment where there is a race to the bottom on voters attention. Overall this could decrease the perceived legitimacy of the system. The counter argument is that tooling providers should not use metadata to solely highlight proposals. rather other means such as cryptographically verified submitters. This should be used by voters to quickly and easily differentiate between two governance actions which may be having the same or similar on-chain effects. This is why we have chosen a short character limit. as longer titles would reduce the ability for quick reading. This gives voters one step more detail beyond the title. This allows for a compact description of the what. why and how without the voter having to read the larger fields. The motivation is a chance for the author to fully describe the problem that is being solved by the governance action. This is important as all governance actions are a solution to a problem and thus this is a universal field. By showing relation to stakeholders the author is able to show that they have performed adequate research on the problem. Voters can use this field to determine if the problem is sizable enough to warrant voting on. This field gives the author the opportunity to explain how the onchain action is addressing the problem outlined in the motivation. This gives the author a place to discuss any alternative designs or completing governance actions. Voters should be able to use this field to evaluate the applicability of the solution to the problem.',\n",
       " ' References give the author ability to point to supporting research or related work. These should be used by voters to verify the content of supporting research. The inclusion of a hash allows for the supporting documentation to be cryptographically verified. This standard is supported by two different tooling providers used to submit governance actions to chain. This standard is supported by two different chain indexing tools. used to read and render metadata. Solicitation of feedback. I would like to thank those that contributed to the Governance Metadata Working Group Workshop #1 hosted by Ryan Williams (see presentation slides with notes). Thank you to the co-hosts:. Thank you to the participants:. I would like to thank those that contributed to the Governance Metadata Working Group Workshop #2 hosted by Ryan Williams (see presentation slides with notes). Thank you to the co-host:. Thank you to the bots that joined also. with the addition of many new on-chain governance artefacts. Some of these artefacts support linking to off-chain metadata as a way to provide context. This proposal aims to provide a specification for off-chain metadata vocabulary that can be used to give context to CIP-100 for DRep registration and updates. Without a sufficiently detailed standard for DRep metadata we introduce the possibility to undermine the ability of DReps to explain their motivations and therefore people looking for someone to represent them with the best possible information available to make that choice. Thank you to everyone who participated in the CIP workshops. and to @ryun1 for creating the JSON-LD schemas for this CIP and for his excellent technical support and invaluble advice. Thank you also to the other CIP editors and attendees of the CIP Editors Meetings where this CIP was refined. most notably @rphair and @Crypto2099. CIP-1694 has set forth a model of a blockchain controlled by its community. and in doing so has challenged providers to build apps and tools that will allow users easy access to the governance features currently being built into Cardano. Minimum viable tools must be ready at the time these governance features are launched. The motivation for this CIP therefore is to provide these toolmakers with a simple and easy to accommodate standard which. once adopted. will allow them to read and display the metadata created by anyone who follows this standard when creating their DRep registration or update metadata. Tooling designed for DReps so that they can easily create metadata will also be made possible. because toolmakers will not need to individually innovate over the contents or structure of the metadata that their tool creates. Metadata is needed because blockchains are poor choices to act as content databases. By only supplying a url to the off-chain metadata. and a hash of that metadata to the blockchain we ensure correctness of data whilst minimising the amount of data posted on-chain. I believed that this CIP would provide a benefit to:. tooling can only see the content and history of DRep registration and update certificates and any associated anchors.',\n",
       " ' These on-chain components do not give any context to the motivation of a DRep. even though this information would likely be the desired context for people who might delegate their voting power. By providing rich contextual metadata we enable people choosing a DRep to delegate their voting power to make well informed decisions. DReps will be able to use tools that create metadata in a standard format. This in turn will allow their metadata to be read by apps that will render their words on screen for potential delegating Ada Holders to enjoy. this may lead to greater levels of delegation. By standardising off-chain metadata formats for any tooling which creates and/or renders metadata that is referenced in DRep registration and update transactions we facilitate interoperability. This in turn promotes a rich user experience between tooling. This CIP explains the structure of any metadata referenced in a metadata anchor optionally included in any DRep registration or update transaction. This CIP has been written for individuals acting in the capacity of DReps. and not for teams of people collaborating as a single DRep. although this does not preclude teams from using metadata in the structure explained by this CIP. DRep Metadata will not follow the CIP-100 specification related to signing the metadata. the authors property can be left blank without the need for tooling providers to warn their users that the author has not been validated. Instead the author can be derived from the DRep ID associated with the registration or update. The need for an authors field will also be discarded in favour of including givenNames and Identity inside of the body field. For the avoidance of doubt this CIP recommends that the entire authors property be left blank. and that tooling ignore it. Like CIP-108. this CIP also extends the potential vocabulary of CIP-100s body property. Furthermore we extend the Schema. org definition of a Person. Any property of Person maybe included within the body. Reminder for tooling providers/builders DRep metadata is user generated content. The following are a list of properties tooling should expect to encounter:. DReps may want to receive tokens for a variety of reasons such as:. Therefore there MAY be a paymentAddress field in the metadata where such payments could be sent. This makes such an address public and payments to DReps transparent. This SHOULD NOT be confused with the address property of a Person. address in the context of a DRep refers to their location and NOT their payment address. imageObject contains a base64 encoded image in its contentUrl property in a dataURI format:. If the imageObject DOES NOT contain a base64 encoded image. the contentUrl MUST contain the URL where the image can be found and the sha256 property MUST be populated with the SHA256 hash of the image file contents found at the contentUrl. The SHA256 hash is needed in order for readers to verify that the image has not been altered since the metadata anchor was submitted on-chain. Only the givenName property is listed above as compulsory.',\n",
       " ' DRep metadata must include it to be considered CIP-119 compliant. all CIP-100 fields can be included within CIP-119 compliant metadata. The compulsory nature of this field was controversial because the givenNames cannot be made unique and therefore are open to abuse (by e. copycats). However this is not a reason to not include a givenName. it a reason for people reviewing a DReps profile to properly check their whole profile before delegating to them. A givenName MUST be included because a person must always have a name. Iit is a human readable identifier. it is the property that people reviewing DReps will most likely identify a given DRep by. even in the presence of copycats. It has been suggested that the objectives. motivations. and qualifications properties (or at least the latter two) could be one freeform property instead of 3. The rationale for having 3 separate properties is to provide structure to DReps so that they have a useful set of prompts about what they can and should write about. The author noticed in research that a single bio field in a form typically resulted in lower quality. often single line. responses from respondents than when this bio field was split into smaller fields with more highly specified purposes. It has also been suggested that the format of the input into these three properties could be more tightly specified for example qualifications could require a list of qualifications. Whilst this will probably be needed I have left this up to a future CIP to specify what these specifications should be because at this stage (MVP) I have no concrete examples of how people will end up using these fields and I want to leave it up to the community to experiment with this. PKI cryptographic solutions were also considered in the place of the current solution however they were generally considered too complex to implement for minimum viable tooling. There were also other issues with cryptographic forms of identification for MVPs:. This CIP is not written to specifically cover the metadata created to describe teams of people collaborating to register as a DRep. but it is written to cover the metadata created by individuals to describe themselves in their capacity as a DRep. Therefore DReps are people. People who want to extend the use of the DRep metadata can now do so in a way that allows tooling providers to use off the peg solutions. Furthermore there may be SEO benefits to using schema. org templates. According to schema. org The image property inherited from Person can either be a URL to a separate location where an image is stored. or it can be an imageObject. For the following reasons it was originally intended that this CIP would specify the use of an imageObject with a b64 encoded image only. because:. However it was pointed out that this may quickly lead to relatively massive (multi-megabyte) metadata files that are more difficult to fetch and store without providing substantial value. Even IPFS would take a relatively long time to serve these files.',\n",
       " ' and if there was a need to index them by some chain indexer (such as DB-Sync) then this could massively increase the storage space needed to run the indexer. It is also the case that CIP-100 allows for metadata to be saved within a governance transaction. and including b64 encoded images directly within transactions would be troublesome due to their size. This would not be an issue with including an image file URL. Therefore it was decided to allow a provision for people to submit imageObjects with a URL only if a hash was included OR with a base64 encoded image. and allow them to make the decision as to which was most appropriate for their use case. This field was intended for DReps who wish to identify themselves via rich metadata but are not seeking to campaign for delegations. By not being listed via DRep aggregation/campaign tools the idea is that these DReps are less likely to attract unwanted delegation from ada holders. These DReps could be organizations that want to use their ada to vote in a transparent way on-chain but do not wish to vote on the behalf of others. It is expected that tooling such as block explorers will list DReps using doNotList=true. Tooling built specifically for DRep campaign and delegation should respect the intent of this field. This proposal cannot force tooling to respect this desire from DReps. DReps must be aware that any information anchored on-chain can be found via tooling and may result in delegation. CIP-1694 allows for DReps to be registered using a native or Plutus script credential. this implies that individuals could organise to form a team that would have a broad range of expertise. and would perhaps therefore be more attractive to some delegating Ada Holders. Participants at the workshop held to debut the first draft of this CIP strongly advocated in favour of including features that would assist a DRep comprised of a team of individuals to properly describe their endeavour. This CIP has not included these features. the decision not to include these features was made in order to simplify this CIP so that it became suitable for the minimum viable level of tooling. with the expectation that further CIPs will build on it. There have been 3 lively public workshops on this subject. and I would like to thank the following people. A recording of this meeting can be found here.English.This Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) defines a standardized structure for encoding and representing various governance and credential identifiers. specifically designed for DRep. Constitutional Committee (CC) keys. and Governance Actions within the Conway era. This specification introduces a single-byte header that encapsulates metadata related to the key type and credential type. allowing identifiers to retain critical metadata even when stored as byte arrays. By encoding this metadata directly into the bech32 format. we enhance both usability and interoperability across Cardano infrastructure and tools. The Conway era on Cardano introduces new governance features. requiring unique and identifiable credentials for roles such as DReps.',\n",
       " ' Constitutional Committee members. and distinct governance actions. Existing infrastructure and tools that process bech32 identifiers often decode and store the raw byte data for efficiency. unintentionally stripping away the metadata embedded in the bech32 prefix. This CIP addresses that limitation by embedding metadata into a structured single-byte header. allowing credentials to be stored in byte form without losing essential metadata. This standardization facilitates seamless linkage. sharing. and compatibility of governance identifiers across the ecosystem. supporting a robust and interoperable governance framework in Cardano. We define a bytes representation for the various credentials and identifiers along with the their bech32 prefixes in this CIP. Taking inspiration from the Cardano addresses bytes format. we define an 8 bit header and a payload to define the key. which look similar to the reward address byte format but with a new specification and using the governance credentials. We also define a simple bech32 prefix for gov actions. which does not have a credential. Gov actions only contain transaction ID bytes and an index. defined in the Gov Action Section below. The chosen prefixes for each identifier align with Cardanos established naming convention used in ledger specification. ensuring easy recognition and minimizing confusion within the ecosystem. In the header-byte. bits 7;4 indicate the type of gov key being used. The remaining four bits 3;0 are used to define the credential type. There are currently 3 types of credentials defined in the Cardano Conway era. this specification will allow us to define a maximum of 16 different types of keys in the future. There are currently 3 types of governance keys. and it is defined using the first half (bits 7;4) of the header. The different types are summarized below. The second half of the header (bits 3;0) refers to the credential type which can have the values and types as summarized in the table below. We reserve the values 0 and 1 to prevent accidental conflicts with Cardano Address Network tags. ensuring that governance identifiers remain distinct and are not inadvertently processed as addresses. Cardano Conway era introduces proposal procedures to submit gov actions. Gov actions are vote on chain by different kinds of keys. and as such it is necessary to be able to share gov actions across communication channels. The gov action is currently defined as combination of a transaction ID it was submitted in and an index within the transaction. We define a byte format to combine the tx ID and the index to form a single valid byte string. as such it can be converted into a hex format and have its own bech32 prefix. Transaction ID is always a 32 byte length. hence we can append the index bytes to the tx id. please see below. Example 1. TX ID in Hex - 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.

This CIP achieves its objectives by introducing a unified header and payload structure for governance-related keys. allowing for metadata to be directly embedded within the byte-level representation of each identifier. By defining a single-byte header that includes both key type and credential type. the proposal provides a consistent. compact format that retains crucial metadata even when stored or transmitted as raw byte arrays. This specification is designed to be forward-compatible. with a capacity to support up to 16 key types. allowing it to evolve with Cardano’s governance and credential requirements. This approach aligns with existing Cardano address encoding practices while adding specificity for governance keys in the Conway era. By also defining distinct bech32 prefixes for each identifier type. the CIP enhances user-friendliness and makes it easier for tooling and infrastructure to recognize. validate. and link these identifiers within the ecosystem. This design ensures governance identifiers are not only interoperable across platforms but also intuitive and accessible. paving the way for streamlined governance interactions within Cardano’s tooling and community. Tools. Wallets. and Explorers to utilize the identifiers and bech32 prefixes defined in this CIP for communication and view purposes. This CIP uses some bech32 prefixes which are already defined by CIP105 and ref by CIP005. This PR includes updates to both the CIPs with updated vector spec. The suggested changes align with the design of the original CIP005. For key generation tools - To move faster to this CIP. current tools which implement CIP105 based bech32 prefixes do not have to implement this CIP specification. They can change the prefix according to the updates suggested in this CIP. updating bech32 prefix will be a find and replace sort of an updated and it will instantly become compatible with this CIP. Tools like explorers and wallets - These tools can potentially support both formats to start with for the purpose of allowing users to search for drep. cold keys. hot keys as these 3 are impacted by this CIP upgrade. And can continue to show only this CIP specification. having an easy backward compatibility as well moving to this CIP standard.

Some of these artifacts support the linking of off-chain metadata. as a way to provide context to on-chain actions. The CIP-100 | Governance Metadata standard provides a base framework for how all off-chain governance metadata can be formed and handled.',\n",
       " ' This standard was intentionally limited in scope. This proposal aims to provide a specification for the off-chain metadata vocabulary that can be used to give context to Constitutional Committee (CC) votes. The high-level motivation for this proposal is to provide a standard which improves legitimacy of Cardanos governance system. Governance action authors are likely to have dedicated a significant amount of time to making their action meaningful and effective (as well as locking a significant deposit). If this action is not able to be ratified by the CC. it is fair for the author to expect a reasonable explanation from the CC. Without reasonable context being provided by the CC votes. authors may struggle to iterate upon their actions. until they are deemed constitutional. This situation could decrease perceived legitimacy in Cardanos governance. By producing a standard we hope to encourage all CC members to attach rich contextual metadata to their votes. This context should show CC members decision making is fair and reasonable. This context allows the other voting bodies to adequately check the power of the CC. The CC and their votes are fundamentally very different from the other voting bodies. This makes reusing standards from these voting bodies problematic. Cardanos Interim Constitution Article VI Section 4 states:. This section suggests that the CC shall provide rationale documents. Specifying a standard structure and common vocabulary for these documents aids the creation of supporting tooling. By creating and implementing these metadata standards we facilitate the creation of tooling that can read and write this data. Such tooling greatly expands the reach and effectiveness of rationales as it allows for rich user interfaces to be created. translation tools. rationale comparison tools. We define a specification for fields which can be added to CC votes. Here we extend CIP-100s references field. CC must include all compulsory fields to be considered CIP-136 compliant. all CIP-100 fields can be included within CIP-136 compliant metadata. By providing a peer reviewed structure for CC vote rationale. we encourage detailed voting rationales increasing the legitimacy of CC votes within the governance system. We include compulsory summary with limited size to allow for the creation of tooling which layers of inspection to vote rationale. This allows readers to get a summary of a rationale at a high level before reading all the details. This field allows for a very long-form discussion of their rationale. This is compulsory because it forms the core of their rationale. By setting some fields to compulsory we ensure a minimum amount of data for downstream tools to expect to render. This is a dedicated field to be able to discuss specific precedent of votes. By separating this from rationaleStatement we encourage specific discussion of precedence as well as clear separation in tooling. This is a dedicated field to be able to discuss counterarguments from those proposed in the other fields. By separating this from rationaleStatement we encourage specific discussion of counterarguments as well as clear separation in tooling. This field. gives the ability for CC members who are operated by multiple individuals to share insights on specific voting choice of the individuals.',\n",

Intersect has facilitated open and transparent elections to the interim Constitutional Committee. the body overseeing the implementation of the interim Constitution during the bootstrapping phase following the Chang upgrade. and supports its day-to-day running. The Voltaire era continues the project to fully decentralize the Cardano network. introducing the ability for the community to present proposals to improve and update the network. to be voted on using the existing staking and delegation process to vote on such proposals.

Voltaire establishes processes for proposing. debating. and implementing network changes. giving the community a direct voice and completing the transition to a genuinely community-driven platform. Its where the decentralization that began with\\\\xa0 Shelley fully blossoms. CIP 1694: The Blueprint for Decentralization. CIP 1694 is the Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) named after Voltaires birth year. It defines the governance system of the Voltaire era and outlines mechanisms for on-chain voting. treasury management. and constitutional changes. Born from a desire to realize decentralization fully. CIP 1694 establishes a framework where Ada holders directly control the platforms future. making Cardano a truly community-governed ecosystem. A strong community desire for on-chain governance drove CIP 1694s development. Recognizing the importance of broad consensus. community leaders initiated discussions and events. including a governance workshop letter that sparked considerable engagement. This led to a global workshop grant fund supported by IOG. Nearly 100 applications were received. resulting in a series of in-person and virtual workshops held worldwide. The workshops aimed to gather diverse feedback on CIP 1694s proposals. addressing key questions like governance action deposits. and voting thresholds. The synthesized feedback from these global discussions directly shaped the final CIP 1694 design. The Chang and Plomin Hard Forks. The journey continued in two dynamic phases. each a significant leap forward. The first act. named Chang after Phil Chang. occurred in August 2024 and was about building the foundation. This bootstrapping phase introduced PlutusV3. a powerful engine that unlocks complex voting mechanisms and paved the way for the full realization of the Conway era. Delegated Representatives (DReps) and an Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC) were also introduced. Last but not least. Cardano got its interim constitution. The second act. ignited by the community through an on-chain governance action in December 2025. unleashed the full potential of on-chain decision-making. This wasnt just about voting; it was about actual ownership. and the ICC were all fully enabled to participate. making decisions directly impacting the ecosystem. including treasury withdrawals. This pivotal moment. previously known as Chang upgrade #2. was renamed the Plomin Hard Fork to honor the memory of Matthew Plomin.',\n",
       " ' who tragically passed away in 2024. The Interim Constitution: A Stepping Stone. The Chang hard fork was more than just technical upgrades; it was a new era of governance. with the interim constitution playing a pivotal role. This document was a temporary framework. a crucial stepping stone toward a fully realized Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution. It provided the initial structure and guidelines for on-chain governance. enabling the community to experiment. learn. and refine the processes that would ultimately shape Cardanos future. It outlined fundamental governance principles. including the roles of DReps. the ICC. and Ada holders. It introduced mechanisms for proposing and voting on network changes. setting the stage for a more comprehensive governance system. This interim phase was essential for several reasons. It allowed the community to gain practical experience with on-chain governance. testing proposed mechanisms in a real-world setting and providing valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of decentralized decision-making. Building Consensus: Constitutional WorkshopsConsensus wasn’t built overnight—it required more dialogue and debate. but it always required a shared vision. 63 Constitutional Workshops were hosted in 52 countries. where more than 1.400 community members with a broad range of cultural experience and technical viewpoints came together to refine the governance principles set out by the Interim constitution and build consensus for the future. Each workshop would elect a Delegate and Alternate Delegate whose roles were to gather and consider views or concerns representative of their community - enabling an incredible breadth of perspectives to be brought to the upcoming Constitutional Convention. The Constitutional Convention. The Constitutional Convention gathered hundreds of people from across the Cardano ecosystem. representing the global voices of their communities. Held simultaneously in Buenos Aires and Nairobi from December 4 to 6. this landmark event reinforced community ownership of governance. It was another highlight in our journey towards decentralized governance and a fully ratified Cardano Constitution. After intense deliberation on the draft version of the Constitution. the delegates voted an overwhelming “Yes!” to proceed to an on-chain vote by DReps and the ICC. On-Chain Voting and Ratification: The Voice of the Community. Following the Plomin Hard fork. on January 30th. the delegate-endorsed constitution was formally submitted for DReps and the ICC to vote on. This updated constitution represents a significant milestone. replacing the interim constitution as a temporary framework. Its purpose is to provide a solid and enduring foundation for the Cardano ecosystem. guiding its future development and governance. This foundational document outlines the principles. rules. and processes shaping the Cardano blockchain and its community. On February 18th. the governance action reached the required approval threshold. The DReps approved the constitution with an 84. 29% vote. signifying their confidence in its design and purpose. The ICC unanimously voted constitutional. affirming its adherence to established standards and principles. With these approvals secured. the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution was officially enacted on February 23rd. The Road Ahead: Elections and Amendments. With the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution now ratified. DReps in place. and a Constitutional Committee established. the Cardano ecosystem is poised for its next development phase.',\n",
       " ' A key focus is the upcoming Constitutional Committee election. The ICC is set to expire on Epoch 580 (September 1st). In anticipation of this transition. the Constitutional Committee election working group. operating under the Civics Committee. is diligently working to propose an initial framework for the election process. Further details regarding this election will be released shortly. Beyond the immediate priority of this election. the community may also consider the future of the constitution itself. Remember that this is the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution. not the final one. The document is designed to be adaptable and responsive to the emerging needs of the Cardano ecosystem. discussions and planning about the future of the Constitution can progress regarding how. if. and when the Constitution might be amended in the future.Budget proposals updated. plus more - Intersect Development Update.

Join us for a special X Space in collaboration with Epoch’s End. where we celebrate this important milestone at 9 PM UTC on Sunday. Intersect’s Constitutional Council was proud to vote YES to the governance action! Thank you to Mauro Andreoli. Ian Hartwell. HOSKY. Juan Sierra. Mercy Fordwoo. Eystein Magnus Hansen. Ubio Obu. and Jose Miguel De Gamboa. You can view their rationale here. Decrease treasury tax from 20% to 10%. On Thursday. February 13. a new governance action titled “Decrease Treasury Tax from 20% to 10%” was submitted. This action aims to reduce the Cardano treasury cut from 20% to 10% to increase staking rewards for both SPOs and delegators. Intersect’s parameters committee has been requested to review this proposal to provide guidance on the impacts. Useful links: Delegate to a DRep. Register as a DRep. What is a Governance Action.

Hard fork working group sign-off - for now!Intersects hard fork working group was designed to oversee the Chang and Plomin upgrades. which became known in the community and across the ecosystem. The working group first sat as a team of three on February 13. Since this first gathering. the working group has met at least weekly. if not more. Eventually. it grew to an attendee list of more than sixty. providing updates via the knowledge base and hard fork bulletins to thousands across the Cardano ecosystem. The hard fork working group met for the last time on Tuesday. February 11. almost a year later. The group has fulfilled its remit to oversee all aspects of the Chang and Plomin hard forks to a successful conclusion and will cease—at least for now! With the current conversation on product roadmaps and budget proposals.',\n",
       " ' the community will define and determine future upgrades. Thousands of people have contributed to these hard forks by helping peers and sharing knowledge. updating nodes. readying DApps and tooling. or participating in new on-chain governance. Although a few stand out. many have contributed to the hardworking group. Without their efforts. the outcomes of these hard forks may have been very different. In no special order. we would like to pay special thanks to these people and their contributions over the last year:. Additional hard fork workshops will arise as and when the community decides. at which time the Technical steering committee will once more call upon the community. Until then a huge thank you to all that took part. Membership and Community. With our latest enterprise member.

This also includes facilitating a budget process to propose funding a diverse roadmap that matches ecosystem priorities. which are submitted as governance actions for on-chain approval by ada holders. Intersect played a key role in supporting the Cardano ecosystem by facilitating grants designed to support the 2024 roadmap. which included both the Chang and Plomin upgrades and funding community tooling and outreach to foster an accessible and inclusive environment in the age of Voltaire. Last year’s work highlighted the significant impact that funding opportunities can have on strengthening a decentralized ecosystem. especially as we navigate the formative years of Cardano’s on-chain governance system. By empowering members to propose and implement ideas. we saw meaningful progress across various initiatives that benefited the broader Cardano network.

Work-in-progress budget proposals shared!. Exciting news! This week. the Budget Committee released the Intersect-wide committee drafts of proposed Cardano budgets. We’ve also provided a draft ecosystem budget overview document. which outlines how the proposed budget process will work and includes financial breakdowns. the document contains detailed proposals for each budget-assigned category. covering core development. governance support. growth & marketing. and innovation. All drafts have been published in their respective threads on the Cardano Forum for community review. Fiscal responsibility and Cardano’s first Net-Change-Limit. To maintain the sustainability and stability of Cardano’s treasury. a Net-Change-Limit has been suggested. which would. if approved. set the constitutional and democratic mandate for the amount of ada that can be withdrawn from the Treasury over the 2025 period. The total indicative withdrawal limit spans approximately 73 epochs between January and December 2025 and has been suggested at 350 million ADA. This figure aligns with the projected treasury growth in 2025. which is estimated at approximately 350 million ADA. It positions the budget framework as balanced. funding the ecosystem for 2025 while leaving net Treasury resources unchanged from 2024 levels*. The intent is to ensure that expenditures remain sustainable while enabling strategic investment in ecosystem growth. This figure remains subject to further review and on-chain approval as the ecosystem seeks to balance prudence with a forward-looking approach to treasury allocation. This approach aims to:. Feedback time!. The Budget Committee has prepared the draft Net-Change-Limit metadata for community review and feedback. also available on the Cardano Forum. * Note: on Thursday February 13. a governance action was raised to change the treasury_growth_rate from 20% to 10%. This is the first community-raised parameter change using the new features available to ada holders following the Plomin Upgrade!. This will impact projected revenues for the Treasury. warranting further community consideration. The Parameters subcommittee is preparing an analysis of expected and potential impact. both in the immediate and future. It’s now over to the community to decide.

Let’s dive straight into the update!. Budget update and socialization period. The Cardano Budget is a key element in ensuring the sustainable development of the ecosystem. With full on-chain governance now in place following the Plomin hard fork last week. the components to make the treasury entirely decentralized are in place. allowing the community to allocate funds directly. All that is needed now is community agreed-upon budgets that enable the ecosystem to decide how the treasury funds should be allocated. As part of this transformation. Intersect has been working on consolidating budget proposals from committees. community members. and organizations. seeking alignment with Cardano’s strategic priorities. The process includes community input. governance voting. and structured fund disbursement. ensuring transparency and accountability. the process and supporting documentation remain a work in progress. All figures. timelines. and proposals are indicative and subject to change based on community feedback. market conditions. and on-chain approvals. Socializing proposals. Early next week. the current work-in-progress will be shared with the community on the Cardano Forum. marking the start of the next consultation phase. Situational awareness. We recognize that the process has not been as smooth or inclusive as it should be. While significant effort has gone into shaping these proposals. we acknowledge the concerns raised by community members about transparency. engagement. and clarity. This is a learning process for all involved. and we approach it with humility. knowing that improvements must be made. We want to assure the community that we are listening. Based on the feedback received. we have clarified the socialization period to ensure ample time for discussion. and refinement before any proposal goes on-chain. following recent reports. we want to clarify that all events aimed at socializing the budget process and facilitating deeper discussions will be global. with both in-person and virtual options available. This period is an opportunity for open dialogue. deeper collaboration. and meaningful adjustments to ensure the outcome truly reflects the collective wisdom and priorities of the Cardano community. Thank you to all the members who have helped initiate this process. which is highly complex and a first for Cardano. Further details on the budgets and next steps will be shared very soon. so watch the usual communications channels for more on this in the coming days. ConstitutionThursday.

Over the last few months. Intersect staff has worked closely with the Cardano marketing working group (MWG). This working group has been resilient and persistent in its efforts to drive marketing efforts for the whole ecosystem. Towards the end of 2024. multiple proposals were brought to this group from EMURGO. RARE Network. and more! Citing recent approval from the Intersect Steering Committee (ISC). we are pleased to announce the Growth and Marketing Committee (GMC). This committee is bootstrapped with representation from EMURGO. IO. and the long-standing dedicated members from MWG. During the bootstrap phase. these members will continue to advocate for marketing budget proposals. finalize a strategy draft. and determine criteria for future committee candidates. The committee will participate in the April elections and have a full. community-elected body by the end of 2025. Membership and communityWe’re thrilled to welcome our newest enterprise members warmly: Hello Labs and The Cardano Blockchain Infrastructure Alliance! We look forward to a strong and successful collaboration with each of you. As our membership continues to expand. here’s a look at our latest numbers:. Last week. our LATAM hub hosted its Uruguay hub launch. Our Hub Manager. Mauro Andreoli. had the following to say about the event:. “On January 31. during the peak of the summer season in Punta del Este. Uruguay. an event titled “Cardano Builders: A Holistic Introduction to the Cardano Ecosystem” occurred. The event covered the founding entities of Cardano’s governance. emphasizing the opportunities available within Intersect. Following these discussions. an idea workshop was conducted. and a training session with prizes was held for those interested in applying to Project Catalyst. This dynamic format combined interactive talks and teamwork. enhanced by monetary rewards. ensuring active engagement and a satisfying experience for all attendees. After the winners were announced. the event concluded with a Sunset Party featuring a DJ and stunning views of Punta del Este’s beaches. Thanks to a collaboration with Aperol Spritz and a prior hands-on session with the Vesper Wallet and Hosky Airdrops. attendees had the unique opportunity to purchase their drinks directly using the Cardano mainnet. Undoubtedly. it was a remarkable and unforgettable event. we have the following activities taking place:. North America hub. led by AWEN. this weeks community hub stats are as follows:. Cardano Curation has released its fourth educational video. “CIP 1694 Explained” as part of its grant to produce short. educational. entertaining videos. The video explains how the Voltaire era will be fully launched with the Plomin hard fork.',\n",
       " ' If you’d like to learn more about the status of grants and read up on those that have been fulfilled. Note: All updates on grants relate to the completion of contracts issued in 2024. With the budget process for 2025. we are moving to a tender approach. where Committees initiate tenders based on any approved budget items. Intersect stake-based voting tool. Intersect requires a robust and versatile voting tool to facilitate yearly stake-based voting events. including Constitutional Committee elections. Next week. Intersect will open a tender requiring community members to submit applications to build this tool using any existing open-source voting tool (of keeping the outcome open-source as well). The application process will last two weeks. followed by two weeks of evaluation. Earlier this week. we provided the update on GovTool development. which is available on the Intersect website. The core issue raised by community members revolves around the lack of Governance Action (GA) support in the proposal submission area of GovTool following the implementation of the Plomin Upgrade. This is a valid critique. thereby better aligning with the wider community needs. GovTool was designed to evolve alongside Cardano’s governance capabilities. but we underestimated the urgency and complexity of supporting all GA types after the Plomin upgrade took effect. Governance actions can be raised using the CLI. but recognize that the lack of features in the GovTool interface is a barrier for non-technical users. This planning misstep has caused frustration. and we sincerely apologize for it. We will also seek to address this capability in the coming days and weeks. Short-Term GovTool priorities (this week and next). January 31. This weeks meeting was open and transparent. After implementing the Plomin Upgrade. it focused on the lack of Governance Action (GA) support in the proposal submission area of GovTool. We have aligned on a short-. medium-. and long-term roadmap. also available in the update published on the Intersect website.At Intersect. we are committed to empowering the Cardano ecosystem through tools that enable transparent. and effective governance. we want to address recent feedback regarding Cardano GovTool following the Plomin upgrade. We hear you. and we highly value the constructive criticism that has been shared. The core issue raised by community members revolves around the lack of Governance Action (GA) type support in the proposal submission area of GovTool following the implementation of the Plomin Upgrade. This would have allowed for broader feedback to help adjust the direction. as well as made it easier to identify ways to contribute. thereby better aligning with the wider needs of the community. GovTool was designed to evolve alongside Cardano’s governance capabilities but we underestimated both the urgency and complexity of supporting all GA types after the Plomin upgrade took effect. Governance actions can be raised by using the CLI. but recognize that the lack of the feature within the GovTool interface is a barrier for non-technical users. We will also seek to address this capability in the coming weeks. To provide context. GovTool’s development has followed a phased approach.',\n",
       " ' prioritizing features based on user needs and technical complexity. our focus was on ensuring that the most common participation avenues—DRep registration. and voting—were accessible and user-friendly. supporting the technical bootstrapping phase following the Chang Upgrade on September 1st. we ensured that all Governance Action (GA) types could be rendered properly for DRep voting. a critical feature to enable full governance and broad community participation. For GA submission and off-chain discussions. we began with the simplest governance actions: Info Actions and Treasury Withdrawals. These were chosen because they are the least complex and most immediately useful for the majority of users. We are expanding support to other GA types. focussing on Constitutional Updates. which will have the most significant impact on the ecosystem at this time. Each type comes with its own technical and user experience challenges. One of the specific pieces of feedback we received was about the UI for the NO VOTE count. which some users found misleading due to it including the “NOT VOTED” amount along with active “NO” votes. We understand how this could create confusion. especially for new users. and does not accurately reflect the state of a governance action. On Friday Jan 31. we pushed a fix to address this issue and improve the clarity of the voting interface. The Governance Tools Working Group. in collaboration with the Intersect members on the development side. has outlined a roadmap for Q1 to address community feedback and expand GovTool’s functionality. Here’s an overview of what’s coming:. We are also exploring ways to streamline the user experience for complex governance actions. ensuring that even highly technical processes are as intuitive as possible. This roadmap reflects the team’s commitment to addressing community needs and improving GovTool’s functionality. Wed love to hear more. with your feedback playing a central role in shaping these priorities. and we encourage you to join the Governance Tools Working Group or share your thoughts via the feedback button on GovTool. Cardano’s initial suite of governance tooling is maintained by Intersect members. WeDeliver. Byron. Lido Nation. and Bloxico. with its direction guided by the Governance Tools working group. This group sets the vision. roadmap. and priorities. ensuring that GovTool—including the “Outcomes” feature and the Constitutional Committee portal—evolves to serve the broader Cardano community. Cardano GovTool and the Constitutional Committee Portal are open-source projects with a publicly accessible backlog. The backlog is actively shaped by community feedback. which is reviewed regularly by the Governance Tools working group. While this collaborative approach ensures general alignment with community needs. it also means development may not always progress as quickly as we’d like. Contribute. Everyone is welcome to contribute at any stage—from discovery and design to development. The current maintainers and Intersect staff are here to support and enable contributions. To keep track of progress. we provide regular updates in our weekly development reports and encourage you to join the working group to share your feedback and thoughts.

While GovTool aims to simplify the submission process for the non-technical user. it is not the only way to submit governance actions. Following the Plomin upgrade on January 31. any ada owner can submit a governance action directly on-chain using other tools or Cardano’s Command Line Interface (CLI). How to create Governance Actions using CLI. While the prioritization decisions for GovTool this time did not meet community expectations. the Governance Tools Working Group—with active input from the community—is driving improvements to ensure the tool evolves in the right direction. As always. your feedback has been essential in reshaping priorities and guiding development efforts. We will continue to provide regular updates on progress. and accountability remains central to this process. GovTool is a community tool. and Intersect is committed to supporting its growth and improvement.Welcome to Intersect development update 47. This week was tremendous and historic for Cardano. as the CIP-1694 specification was completed. as we crossed the epoch boundary. and the Plomin hard fork was enacted. More on this. as well as updates on progress toward the Cardano budget. committee activities. community tooling. and much more! Full on-chain governance is here - Plomin hard fork enacted!. Cardano achieved the transition to full community governance with the enactment of the Plomin hard fork. The upgrade was enacted on-chain after the hard fork was approved by stake pool operators (SPOs) and the interim constitutional committee. This is a truly momentous achievement. not only for Cardano but for the entire blockchain industry. This is Cardano’s first community-enacted upgrade. with all future protocol changes now fully in the hands of the community. The decision began with CIP-1694. which was developed over two years and included community workshops. It is the only hard fork to make such an epochal change to blockchain governance. From this instant. the future of the Cardano blockchain is determined by governance actions. Any ada holder can raise a governance action. and all ada holders can vote to accept or reject it. They can do this as individuals or by delegating their voting power to delegated representatives (DReps) - Read more here. Staking rewards. Following the success of the Plomin hard fork. you will continue accumulating staking rewards. as specified in CIP-1694. you cannot withdraw them unless you delegate your ada’s voting rights to a DRep or a predefined voting option. The community took this decision at the first CIP-1694 workshop in Longmont. CO. in March 2023. Like staking with stake pool operators. the staked ada never leaves your wallet. and delegating does not impose new spending or selling restrictions. It takes just a few minutes of your time and does not involve any additional cost or risk. but enables you to contribute to shaping the future of Cardano. How to choose and delegate to a DRep.

       " ' Cardano’s constitution nears ratification. The Cardano community has completed the drafting of a new constitution. with it now on-chain for DRep and the interim Constitutional Committee to consider!. This achievement resulted from a collaborative process led by the Cardano Civics committee. involving community workshops. a constitutional convention. and the ongoing on-chain vote. Community-driven process. The process began with the Cardano Civics committee releasing a draft constitution. More than 1400 community members then participated in 63 workshops worldwide to discuss 15 open questions about the draft. Each workshop elected a delegate and an alternate to represent them at the Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires and Nairobi. At the convention. delegates worked together to finalize the constitution. achieving a 95% approval rate. This collaborative approach ensured that the new constitution reflected the communitys diverse perspectives and priorities. The constitutions purpose. The Cardano constitution serves as the guiding document for Cardanos governance. It defines the fundamental principles. values. and rules that shape the development and evolution of the Cardano ecosystem. It acts as an agreement among stakeholders. outlining the rights and responsibilities of community members. delegated representatives (DReps). stake pool operators (SPOs). and the constitutional committee (CC). By establishing these key elements. the Constitution provides clarity. stability. and a framework for resolving disagreements. It ensures that Cardano remains committed to its vision of a decentralized. and sustainable blockchain platform. Improvements and next steps. The proposed constitution has taken into account the valuable input gathered across the 63 global workshops and has been updated in the following ways:. A refined preamble - Clearly expressing the communitys shared values. Ten guiding tenets - Including a 45 billion ada supply cap. A framework for the Cardano ecosystem budget - Establishing a process for annual budgeting. Codes of conduct - Promoting ethical voting practices for DReps. and the CC. Compensation guidelines - Allowing reimbursement for DReps and CC members. Enhanced clarity and safeguards for the CC - Ensuring transparency and accountability. Amendment process - Enabling the constitution to adapt to future needs. While the proposed constitution represents significant progress. delegates identified areas for further development. These include refining the DRep system. clarifying the roles of various entities. and further developing the treasury and budget process. Participate in the vote. The Cardano community is now encouraged to vote on the proposed constitution. The governance action to update the constitution was submitted on January 30 and will be open for voting by DReps and CC for up to six epochs. It will be ratified once the necessary threshold of 75% yes votes by DReps and a 67% constitutional vote by the ICC have been met. After roughly 24 hours. At the time of writing. the current status is:. The current threshold for approval is 2. 46 billion ada (75% of active delegation). Top 5 Voting DReps (by stake):. Visit the Constitutional Convention website. Read the proposed constitution. Constitution vote - all you need to know. Budget committee: updates and initiatives. With the Constitution now live for voting. the budget committee is gearing up to raise the Net-Change-Limit governance action.',\n",
       " ' This constitutionally-mandated Info Action will add an additional layer of safeguarding as defined in the delegate-endorsed Constitution and the technical specification of Cardano’s on-chain governance (CIP-1694). Info Actions pertaining to a budget are evaluated and ratified by DReps and the Constitutional Committee. ensuring that future budgets remain within the stated limits. Committees across Intersect will publish their budget requests for review and consideration to support the Net-Change-Limit Info Action. This milestone will begin the formal evaluation period. It will involve significant engagement with the DReps and Committees to discuss their requests and refining before any budget Info actions are raised. The Cardano Civics committee at Intersect is forming a new working group focused on the upcoming Constitutional Committee elections. The group is developing a proposed election cycle process. which will be presented to the community once drafted. Committee efforts have intensified. with the Plomin upgrade harnessing community energy and momentum. Their activities include preparing budget proposals. DRep engagement. community engagement. proposal reviews. and roadmap development. Thanks to hundreds of members who have been participating at new levels.

January 17.Cardano is taking the next step in its governance journey by developing and implementing its first community-driven Constitution. Crafted with input from 1.400 contributors across 63 workshops in 50 countries. this Constitution represents the community vision and shared values. and confirms a key check and balance within Cardano’s governance model. In December 2024 the 63 elected delegates came together at the Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires and Nairobi and voted 95% in favor of approving the draft Constitution for an on-chain vote. Path to ratification. This next step is crucial: the governance action proposing replacing the interim Constitution with the delegate-endorsed Constitution is now on-chain!. DReps and the Interim Constitutional Committee will decide whether to ratify the delegate-approved Constitution fully. with the action requiring. On-chain. See the action via tooling;. Key dates. The Civics Committee’s Ratification working group is spearheading this effort. With the Civics Committees endorsement and following the successful enactment of the Plomin hard fork. Intersect has now submitted the action. The voting period will run from January 30th to March 5th. If the above thresholds are met during this period. enactment could occur between February 13th and March 10th. This governance action is notable as the first “non-info” action for DRep approval. So take this opportunity to register as a DRep. or be ready to check your DRep’s voting rationale. Stay informed and engaged. This milestone marks a pivotal moment in Cardano’s evolution. The ratification of its first community-driven Constitution will set the stage for a new era of decentralized governance. For a deep dive into all the materials and consultation process. head over to our knowledge base. Throughout February. we’ll host spaces and forums to continue the conversation with delegates and members of the Civics committee and various working groups. Watch this space!. As the community takes collective ownership of this process. we encourage all members and associates to stay informed. engage with their DReps. and actively contribute to this historic step.

       " ' inclusivity. and shared purpose.On January 29. This is the first hard fork in blockchains short history to be decided. approved. and enacted with the full involvement of the community rather than by a central authority. It is also the only hard fork to make such an epochal change to blockchain governance. They can do this as individuals or by delegating their voting power to delegated representatives (DReps). About the hard fork. The Plomin hard fork is the second part of the Chang upgrade to Cardano. Initially known as Chang #2. it was renamed in memory of Matthew Plomin. a contributor to the Cardano community. The Chang #1 upgrade moved the blockchain into a bootstrapping phase to prepare for the transition to full community governance. An essential feature of this phase was the creation and approval of a draft\\\\xa0 Cardano constitution in December. With the enactment of the Plomin hard fork. the system of voting by ada holders is fully established. One of the first tasks of the ada holders and DReps will be to ratify the delegate-endorsed constitution by on-chain voting. with one lovelace counting as one vote. Governance actions explained. There are seven types of governance action. shown in the following table. Staking Rewards. The community should note that although post-Plomin staking rewards will continue to be earned as usual. ada holders must delegate to a DRep to withdraw their rewards following the Plomin hard fork. The delegation can be one of the predefined options. a single key. an active script. or a Plutus v3 script. Keep informed. Join the dedicated Plomin hard fork Discord channel at #hfwg-plomin. The Intersect knowledge base has been updated. and information about the Plomin hard fork can be found in the refreshed Cardano Updates space. We recommend bookmarking this page and checking back often. as the hard fork working group regularly updates details. The Knowledge base. guides. and FAQs on GovTool contain information on the constitution and on-chain governance.On January 24. The three thresholds specified for a hard fork action during this interim governance period have been met;. Actual results:. You can view the governance action on chain via GovTool and cardano explorers;. Now that it is approved. the hard fork will be enacted on-chain at the end of the following epoch – on January 29. at 21:45 UTC. This upgrade sets the stage for all future enhancements to the Cardano blockchain. It requires approval from selected community members; all future upgrades will require approval from most of the entire community of ada holders via DReps. Known initially as Chang #2. it was renamed in memory of Cardano community contributor Matthew Plomin. An essential feature of this phase was the creation and approval of a draft\\\\xa0 Cardano constitution in December 2024. When the Plomin hard fork is enacted. the system of voting by ada holders will be established. Everyone who holds an ada can vote directly or through a delegated representative (DRep). The vote can be for or against a governance action or directed to one of two predefined options: abstain or no-confidence.',\n",
       " ' The community should note that. although staking rewards will continue to be earned as usual. The delegation can be one of the predefined options: a single key. a native script.

After many years of work and the dedication of countless individuals. the ecosystem stands with the age of Voltaire before it. Over the last week. key votes have taken place. and as the voting currently stands. the thresholds and guardrails for the Plomin hard fork have been met. The ICC members have voted unanimously to pass the hard fork. The mainnet hard fork governance action will be ratified tonight. January 24. at approximately 21:44 UTC. All governance actions are enacted on the epoch boundary following their ratification. the mainnet hard fork governance action is expected to be enacted on January 29. This will bring full CIP-1694 governance features on-chain and mark the start of the age of Voltaire and decentralized governance for the Cardano blockchain. An achievement everyone associated with Cardano should be proud of. Stay informed. The hard fork working group will continue to meet. make recommendations. and update the Intersect knowledge base during and after the voting and enactment and for any necessary time after the hard fork has taken place. With the completion of the Plomin upgrade. the Budget Committee is preparing to propose the Net-Change-Limit and the draft 2025 Budget proposal for DRep and community review. The draft 2025 Budget Proposal has been completed and is currently under review by the Budget Committee and the chairs of all our committees. This review process has generated valuable insights. and we receive broad feedback. The proposal will remain reviewed and revised until we submit it on-chain in the coming weeks for DRep approval. Consultation period: Key takeaways. Present multiple budgets for community consideration rather than a single. larger budget proposal. Accordingly. each funding track (or bucket) should have its budget Info Action to be voted on by the ICC and DReps. Once the ICC and DReps ratify a funding track (as an Info Action). corresponding Treasury Withdrawal Actions can follow. if there are five funding tracks. there will be five Info Actions and at least five Treasury Withdrawal Actions submitted on-chain for community consideration. We also heard feedback on the net change limit: It should not exceed Treasury income for the same period. in 2025. the Treasury is projected to grow by approximately ₳350 million. A budget proposal submitted on behalf of members and committees at Intersect should not exceed this amount. the Net Change Limit should leave ample headroom for other budgets to be submitted on-chain.',\n",
       " ' As part of our transparency efforts. we heard a strong emphasis on radical transparency in the accounting and auditing of Treasury funds. including the use of smart contracts and on-chain verifiability wherever beneficial. This included carefully considering and documenting how surplus or unspent ADA can be reutilized. reinvested. or returned to the Treasury. Note: Any solution must comply with the interim and/or delegate-approved Constitution (whichever is in effect as per CIP-1694). Learn more about the insights from our consultation period. Constitution. The Cardano Civics Committee’s constitution ratification working group has been working hard behind the scenes. planning how to bring the delegate-endorsed constitution to mainnet. The civics committee recommended. on behalf of the working group. that the delegate-endorsed constitution (formed via the Constitutional Convention) be put on the blockchain as a governance action. Intersect has accepted this recommendation and will pursue it. Depending on the successful enactment of the Plomin hard fork. the working group aims to submit a new constitution governance action on Thursday. This action will send the delegate-endorsed constitution to the DReps and interim constitutional committee(ICC) for ratification. If submitted on the 30th. the actions voting period would be from January 30 to March 5. with potential enactment dates between February 13 and March 10. these dates depend on the will and votes of DReps and the ICC. The successful enactment of this new constitution will replace the interim document. establishing a genuinely community-driven framework shaped by the input of over 1.

Below are our latest stats for Intersect grants:.In October 2024. the Budget committee at Intersect opened a consultation period to gather feedback on what a budget for Cardano should include. how it should be managed. and other topics important to the Cardano ecosystem. The consultation period included hosting over 15 open community calls (for members and non-members). where representatives from the Budget committee and other committees at Intersect shared their ideas and recommendations. The Budget committee is consolidating this input into budget proposal/s for the Cardano community to consider on-chain in early 2025. weekly calls were held for delegated representatives (DReps) and the broader community to learn more about the current approach and process. In parallel. the Budget committee launched a survey to gather input on community development priorities for the coming year (and beyond). The survey aimed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on various budget-related topics. with the goal of understanding priorities for the 2025 budget process facilitated by Intersect and identifying ways to better support member-led decision-making. Over 200 respondents provided valuable perspectives to guide the process. We have summarized the findings from both the open calls and the survey. highlighting the core priorities and focus areas that a budget for Cardano should address. While these results are informative. it is important to acknowledge that this consultation reflects only one avenue for budget-related discussions within the broader Cardano ecosystem. The Cardano treasury offers multiple funding pathways. and the priorities outlined here represent just one contribution to ongoing conversations. Who participated?The survey reached a diverse and experienced group across the ecosystem:. While this group brings considerable experience. the results represent a subset of the broader Cardano community. Budget priorities: What matters most?Respondents placed core infrastructure development at the top of their priorities. with scaling solutions. interoperability. and foundational improvements identified as essential for Cardanos progress. Here is how the priorities ranked:. These insights offer valuable perspectives on priorities within Intersect’s role in supporting Cardano’s development. Reserves: Balancing caution with flexibilityRespondents leaned toward a cautious approach to budget reserves:. This indicates a preference for financial stability while maintaining flexibility to address unforeseen challenges or opportunities. Technology priorities: What’s next?Respondents identified key areas for technological growth:. Engagement and awareness: Room for improvementThe survey revealed an important challenge: 60% of respondents reported limited familiarity with our budget process. While many expressed interest in participating. this lack of familiarity underscores the need for clearer communication and education about how our process fits within the broader Cardano funding landscape.',\n",
       " ' Preferred participation methods:. Most respondents indicated they could commit 1–9 hours per month. showing a willingness to engage. provided the methods remain accessible and clear. Immediate takeaways from the surveyThe survey results highlight key priorities that will shape a budget proposal for the Cardano ecosystem:. For those interested in reviewing the raw survey data. see here. Feedback from open calls. The open calls provided opportunities for the community to discuss budget values. funding. and general budget management. This marks the first time the Cardano community is considering a large treasury allocation for development in 2025. naturally sparking debate on how to proceed. If you’ve missed any of these calls. or want a refresher. check out our dedicated YouTube channel and catch-up with the very latest documentation on the Budget committee’s dedicated knowledge base. Conclusion and next steps. The consultation period represents an important opportunity to enhance transparency and inclusivity in our budget facilitation process. While there is alignment on key areas like core infrastructure and research. there is work to be done in improving awareness. education. and documenting measures for transparency and robust budget management. In the coming weeks. we will move the conversation to the net-change-limit (the maximum amount of ada that can be withdrawn from the Treasury in a given period). and share the current numbers related to the budget process we have been facilitating. From there. the wider community can start to consider what the Treasury can fund. and importantly what the community can expect if budget/s are approved. It is important to note that Intersect’s process is just one pathway to accessing Cardano’s treasury. and these findings represent Intersect’s members perspective within the broader landscape. Learn more and get involved. The process remains open for feedback! If you have questions or ideas. reach out representatives from the Budget committee directly. or via any of our committees who have provided inputs into the process. You can also join the conversation in Discord. Thank you to everyone who participated—your input strengthens this process and brings us closer to funding ecosystem priorities.

       " ' Node versionsNode version 10. 4 is almost identical to nodes 10. 2 and 10. Like those node versions. it is designed to cross the Plomin hard fork. It implements the remainder of the governance capabilities defined in CIP-1694. enabling all seven governance actions and DRep voting. It also enables a number of new Plutus cryptographic and other primitives. All Cardano stake pools and relays must upgrade to this node version to mitigate a potential DoS attack following a hard fork to protocol version 10 (Plomin hard fork on mainnet). All other node users should also upgrade. Node users who do not upgrade risk a potential DoS attack following the hard fork. Node performanceConsistent with expectations. standard benchmark results indicate no notable performance differences between node version 10. 4 and version 10. 2/10. You can find the benchmarking and performance reports here. Participation in GovernanceDespite passing the necessary thresholds. SPOs and exchanges are strongly encouraged to continue to participate and vote on governance actions. especially hard fork actions such as Plomin. You can read full details here in this dedicated Plomin bulletin. For clarity. those not wishing to participate are still asked for initial involvement and to vote to abstain explicitly. An explicit vote to abstain removes your vote power from the total sought for any governance action. An implicit action. ie doing nothing. counts as a ‘no’ vote. and your voting power would count towards this total. In some circumstances. implicitly abstaining may actually increase your participation in governance. as your voting power will count in the governance action. Because of this. the stake pool operators play a vital role in decision-making and leading change within the Cardano network.

Author: Abbie Yeates. providing reports and other artefacts that help the steering committees and membership make effective delivery decisions and promote transparency on progress. Last year and moving into 2025. delivery assurance was pivotal in the core continuity remit. managing 14 contracts. Nine have been completed. while five remain active. with significant progress underway. The complete list of projects is publicly available on the Intersect knowledge base. As we begin 2025. the role of delivery assurance in Intersect has evolved significantly. Initially established to manage contracts with the remit of core continuity technical work. this function has grown alongside the organization. adapting to serve our membership needs better. Initially. delivery assurance focused on overseeing technical contracts. ensuring projects were managed efficiently and effectively on behalf of the ecosystem. Over time. the teams responsibilities have expanded to provide broader support across various contract types. delivery assurance is a small. dedicated team at Intersect here to support all committees. whether their focus is technical or otherwise. As we step into the future. delivery assurance will remain focused on ensuring that every project is delivered successfully. supporting Intersects and its communities continued growth and success. How delivery assurance serves the community. Supporting Cardanos on-chain governance. Cardano is a decentralized. open-source blockchain. Like all software. it needs ongoing maintenance and enhancements to stay relevant and drive mass adoption. Intersect currently stewards more than 100 repositories. including the core Cardano node. development contributions to the core Cardano codebase by organizations other than Input|Output increased by 179%—from 16. 45% in 2023 to 45. 97% in 2024—signaling strong progress ahead of on-chain governance coming into effect. You can read more about Cardano’s distributed development here. Connecting this trajectory with the Budget Committee’s efforts to facilitate a budget proposal for Cardano in 2025. the coordination of counter-party and contract management through a not-for-profit. member-based organization aligns with Cardano’s continued evolution. The goals of delivery assurance. The delivery assurance function strengthens reliability. fosters transparency. and builds trust in the Cardano ecosystem. This role supports Cardanos continuity and growth by ensuring that projects are delivered efficiently and align with community goals. Through robust governance. transparent communication. and quality execution. delivery assurance contributes to a thriving and engaged Cardano community. In summary. delivery assurance monitors the delivery of contracted updates to Cardano on behalf of the community. Its processes and procedures are building a body of knowledge to ensure continuing improvement by and on behalf of the ecosystem. By identifying risks early.',\n",
       " ' confirming the quality of deliverables. and helping contributors meet their milestones in an open organization. delivery assurance plays an essential role in Cardanos ongoing success.Welcome to the first Intersect dev update of 2025! After a well-earned holiday break. we’re diving back into the exciting progress within Cardano governance and Intersect. we’ll pick up where we left off with updates on Cardano’s constitution development. Plomin hard fork progress. open-source initiatives. Let’s kick off the new year by looking at what’s ahead!Plomin UpgradeAs we set foot into the new year. we also step into new territory as we progress in the age of Voltaire with the Plomin hard fork. Readiness page updates\\\\xa0The hard fork readiness page on the Intersect knowledge base keeps the community updated on progress toward the mainnet hard fork. Thank you to those who have contributed and communicated their readiness to date. Many stake pool operators (SPOs) and tooling have made the relevant upgrades and expressed their readiness. The emphasis now turns to exchanges and DApps. The following exchanges were among the first to announce that they are ready for the Plomin hard fork: Bitrue. CEX. Coinbase. Crypto.\\\\xa0 Gate. Kraken. OKX. and Upbit. Exchanges are encouraged to contact the Cardano Foundation through their contact form. selecting “Integrations & Ecosystem Collaborations. ” The Cardano Foundation core integration team will set up a dedicated channel to offer support for their Cardano integrations and provide regular updates. SPO Votes on the Plomin hardfork (data via Adastat - 2024-01-10). with ~14 days left to cast votes. Members of the Interim Constitutional Committee have not yet cast their votes. A huge shout out to the first tranche of DApps that submitted pull requests to the knowledge base and attested their readiness for the Plomin hard fork: Danogo. Fluid Tokens. Genius Yield. Minswap. Snekdotfun. Splash. Summon. Tempo. and Wanchain. To help facilitate the updates to this page. the community is encouraged to suggest readiness updates or attest to the readiness of their tooling and DApps via this new hf-wg-documentation Github repository. The repository readme provides details on how to do this. Please contribute and let the ecosystem know you are ready for the mainnet hard fork. New release of Cardano nodeAll Cardano stake pools and relays should upgrade to Cardano node version 10. 4 to mitigate a potential DoS attack following a hard fork to Protocol Version 10 (Plomin hard fork on mainnet). All other node users should upgrade to this version. Node users who do not upgrade put themselves at risk of a potential DoS attack following the hard fork. Node 10. 4 is a mainnet-ready release of the Cardano node capable of crossing the Chang #2 (Plomin) hard fork. It adds safeguards at the mempool level to block specific transactions that could lead to a DoS attack following the upgrade. Mainnet hard fork governance actionThe governance action for the Cardano mainnet hard fork was submitted on-chain on December 20. following the recommendation of the hard fork working group and supported by the technical steering committee at Intersect.',\n",
       " ' This action represents the ending of the beginning for on-chain governance. If enacted. this action will enable full governance as described in CIP-1694 to mainnet. exiting the technical bootstrapping phase. The delegate-approved constitution will be submitted on-chain for community consideration soon after this upgrade. as suggested by the civics committee. Possible hardfork enactment datesShould the SPO and ICC ratify the governance action. these are the mainnet epoch boundary dates when the Plomin hard fork could occur. Staking RewardsAfter the Plomin hard fork. you will continue accumulating staking rewards (if you are delegating to an SPO). you will not be able to withdraw them unless you delegate your ada’s voting rights to a DRep or a predefined voting option such as auto-abstain. Keep informedJoin the dedicated Plomin Upgrade Discord channel. and information about Plomin can be found in the refreshed Cardano Upgrades space. We recommend bookmarking and checking back often as the hard fork working group regularly updates details. As the landscape of Cardano governance constantly changes. with new governance actions being raised and voted upon. it is essential to cut through the noise and report on the latest governance actions. This bulletin is updated weekly so you can stay informed and involved in shaping Cardanos future. Cardano Civics Committee recommends new Constitution for on-chain ratification. The Cardano Civics Committee (CCC) has officially recommended a new Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution for on-chain ratification. The delegate-approved Constitution is available at this link with a blake2b-256 hash of: 2a61e2f4b63442978140c77a70daab3961b22b12b63b13949a390c097214d1c5. Voted on and approved by 95% of elected Constitutional Delegates. this version reflects extensive community input gathered between July and December 2024—spanning 1.400 participants across 63 in-person workshops in 52 countries. The CCC endorses this version of the Constitution for on-chain ratification. At the Constitutional Convention. a special committee—led by a chair and vice-chair chosen by their peers—will finalize key definitions to aid in understanding the Constitution. compile the Voltaire Papers. and address a series of priority governance workstreams. These potential workstreams include refining the Constitution’s accessibility. expanding educational materials. defining an ethical code for Cardano. establishing a standard budget process. With an overwhelming majority of delegates in favor. this Constitution stands as a milestone for decentralized governance on Cardano—and a testament to the power of global community collaboration.

Thanking The Community and Delegates\\\\xa0This accomplishment is a testament to the dedication and cooperation of countless individuals and groups. Over 1.400 community members have read. engaged with. and provided valuable and meaningful feedback that helped shape the now delegate-approved Constitution. We extend our gratitude to each delegate and alternate for their commitment and the effort they invested in representing their communities. ‘126 strangers from 50 countries came together to ratify the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution. forging new friendships and making history—an incredible testament to Charles’ vision and the strength of our community. ’ - Nathan Barkell. delegate - Perth. Western Australia. Next Steps towards decentralized governance - over to the DRepsThe journey does not end here. The Cardano community. via its delegated representatives (DReps) will soon decide whether to fully ratify the delegate-approved Constitution on-chain. which is expected in January 2025. The process of delegating ada to DReps allows any ada holder to participate in the decentralized decision-making process that underpins the blockchain’s social contract; in this case. the first-of-its-kind Cardano Constitution that will underpin Cardano’s decentralized governance and security long into the future. To this end. it is now vital that both DReps and ada holders who delegate their ada to them understand their roles and responsibilities in the crucial next step to ratifying the Constitution.',\n",

It is expected to be submitted as a Constitutional Amendment governance action following the Plomin upgrade in January 2025. the Cardano community will determine whether to ratify the Constitution. in line with Cardano’s on-chain governance framework. The Constitutional Committee’s RoleLike the interim Constitution. the interim Constitutional Committee (ICC) helped enable the first stage of the Chang upgrade. The ICC provides technical oversight. ensuring the initial community submitted on-chain governance actions adhere to the constitution’s thresholds and safeguards. This system of checks and balances preserves the blockchain’s stability and security while granting the community a decisive voice. If the delegate-approved Constitution is ratified. the ICC will adhere and uphold the new version. The ICC’s term concludes in the summer of 2025. the community will elect members for the next term—another step toward a fully decentralized and representative governance model. Looking back. moving forwardFrom early workshops to this week’s monumental endorsement. Cardano’s community has taken deliberate. inclusive steps toward a robust and enduring governance framework. With scenes captured from both Nairobi and Buenos Aires. this moment will be remembered as a turning point in decentralized decision-making. strengthening Cardano’s position as a leading platform for the future of Web3. Stay engaged. stay informed. and take pride in what we’ve accomplished together. It’s only the beginning of what Cardano’s community can achieve.

Users must upgrade to this node version before the mainnet hard fork. Mainnet hard fork and plan 529 Introducing plan 529. Over the last weeks. the hard fork working group has discussed and agreed the requirements for raising the mainnet hard fork governance action. the hard fork working group’s must-have requirements have been met. Availability and time constraints will also have been met by mainnet epoch 529. Epoch 529 starts on 2024-12-20 at 21:44 UTC. This is the likely planned date for raising the mainnet hard fork governance action. SPOs and the ICC will decide the final date for hard fork enactment. This action and voting can be followed through most on-chain explorers or via the manual updates provided on the Intersect knowledge base. Once the on-chain voting thresholds are met. the hard fork will be enacted after a one-epoch ratification period. with approximately five days notice. With the Plomin upgrade complete. Cardano’s final on-chain governance features will be a reality and live on mainnet.

In a touching tribute to a beloved community leader. the community has chosen to name the second hard fork in the Chang upgrade. the Plomin hard fork. This decision honors the late Matthew Plomin. USDMs president and co-founder. who made an indelible impact on our ecosystem before his sudden passing due to health complications. Matthews visionary leadership and unwavering dedication to the community inspire all of us. and this renaming serves as a heartfelt acknowledgment of his contributions. The Plomin hard fork is not just a technical milestone; it is a testament to the strength and unity of the Cardano community as we honor one of our own. We will be propagating this name change across our various touchpoints over the coming days and weeks. According to Einstein. time is an illusion. and it certainly feels that way as we progress rapidly into the age of Voltaire and toward the full realization of CIP1694. With Cardano node 10 and the Plomin hard fork just around the corner. its a good idea to look at the core components of CIP1694 once more. The CIP1694 was the most widely discussed CIP. generated across multiple community-led workshops worldwide. Its formation is a testament to how passionate ada holders are about ownership over decision-making on the chain. In this blog. we explore the foundation of decentralized governance. and its meaning. Following our blog on Cardano CIP-1694. we also published a blog this week on the importance of delegated representatives. where we dive further into delegating the voting rights of your ada. which is a vital way to shape Cardano’s future in the age of Voltaire actively. Read the full blog here!. We’re excited to remind you about our weekly meetings. an open space for collaboration and discussion.

Our Africa hub. also held their WADA town hall last week. with 16 attendees. our hubs are hosting the following events:. We are happy to share that soon enough. there will be an update ensuring compatibility with the upcoming hard fork and support for all governance action types outlined in CIP-1694.',\n",
       " ' It will also include support for IPFS. the upcoming release can be fully assessed on the preview network which supports full governance. CC-Portal. The builder team is working to bring another CC-Portal release next week that includes additional improvements and full compliance with CIP-136. CC-Portal aims to offer easy access to the interim Cardano constitution and provide constitutional committee members with a streamlined interface for creating metadata as part of their on-chain voting rationale. it serves as a platform for the Cardano community to better understand committee members voting actions. These improvements will make it easier for the constitutional committee and the wider Cardano community to engage with governance actions. The updates are expected to elevate both usability and transparency for all users. The governance tools working group held another meeting this week. further elaborating on the pilot process of getting much-appreciated community feedback on fairness and transparency. The process itself will be documented online in the next few days. You can track the community backlog here. All feedback is welcome (see feedback guide). As we press ahead following Chang #1.

Following on from our blog on Cardano CIP-1694. where we explain the foundation of decentralized governance. we can now dive further into delegating the voting rights of your ada. It allows you to participate in the decentralized decision-making process that underpins the blockchain’s social contract. ensuring that every ada holder’s voice helps guide its direction. You contribute to a resilient. and community-driven ecosystem through delegation. The Chang upgrade comprises two hard forks. Chang and Plomin. and marks a pivotal step in Cardano’s evolution. It places the future of the blockchain firmly in the hands of its most invested stakeholders: the ada holders. The importance of delegated representativesDelegated representatives (DReps) are crucial in the Cardano networks decision-making processes. They effectively advocate for and make informed decisions on behalf of the Cardano community. Delegating your voting rights to a DRep is essential to supporting the ecosystems growth and development. By leveraging expert knowledge in the voting process. ada holders can raise their voices through nominated DReps. who will leverage the voting power of multiple individual ada holders. This way. everyone can contribute to shaping the protocols future. Staking rewardsAfter the Plomin hard fork. you will not be able to withdraw them unless you delegate your ada’s voting rights to a DRep or a predefined voting option.',\n",
       " ' Like rewards staking with stake pool operators. and staking does not impose new spending or selling restrictions. Delegation only needs to be done once. but it enables you to contribute to shaping the future of Cardano. Compatible walletsIntersect maintains a list of wallets that support delegation. More wallets are regularly added to the list. so if your wallet is not on the list today. you can check back later or use one of the compatible wallets with your wallets recovery phrase. How to choose a DRep. Predefined voting optionsYou can delegate to one of two predefined voting options instead of a DRep. An abstain option is a way to ‘opt-out’ of playing a part in decision-making within the governance system. It acts as if your stake is cast to vote ‘abstain’ on all GAs. You will have participated in governance but are not supporting a yes or no vote on proposals. Your voting power. Your staking rewards will be available. A no-confidence option acts as if your stake is cast to vote ‘no’ on all governance actions (GAs) and ‘yes’ to votes of no confidence. This option is extreme. and you would only do it if you wanted the current constitutional committee replaced. Voting on a particular governance actionGovTool allows you to view the current Governance Actions (GAs). If you haven’t yet delegated your voting power to a DRep to vote on your behalf. you can register either as a DRep or as a direct voter. As a direct voter. your voting power will reflect the total ada in the wallet linked to GovTool. As a DRep. you’ll create an off-chain profile to campaign for delegation. enabling you to vote with the ada delegated to you and any personal holdings. In both cases. voting is conducted through GovTool by linking your wallet. DRep campaigningIt is vital that DReps campaign around their intention to vote on any GA. Lobbying for stakes and building support for their position will determine how strong a DRep’s voting power is and. ultimately. how strong a voice they will have at the vote. DReps play an essential part in Cardano’s decentralized governance structure. Not only are they vital in decentralizing the decision-making process. but they are also crucial in breaking down complex governance actions into what they mean for ada holders and communicating why ada holders should care about them. In this way. DReps need to understand that they are not just operators of decentralized democracy but also educators and. as such. must be masterful communicators. DReps enrich the Cardano ecosystem and should be seen as the true representatives of the community. Intersect remains committed to facilitating all areas of decentralized governance. so we will continue to update you on the progress. Keep checking back for more information. We’re interested in hearing more from you about subjects important to you. please get in touch via\\\\xa0email.\\\\xa0X. or\\\\xa0LinkedIn.The foundation of decentralized governance. From its inception in 2015 through its first block in 2017 to 2024 and the Voltaire development phase (named after the French libertarian philosopher).',\n",
       " ' Cardano has aimed to be the most decentralized blockchain. Cardano’s design and implementation evolve through changes proposed in Cardano improvement proposals (CIPs). Cardano CIP-1694. named after the year of Voltaire’s birth. established the foundation for decentralized on-chain governance. CIP-1694 was implemented in two controlled hard forks. beginning the Voltaire development phase. This governance model aims to empower the Cardano community of ada holders with greater control over decision-making processes related to protocol updates. and technical improvements. Development of CIP-1694The proposal was first crafted in a workshop held in Longmont. from February 28 to March 1. It was then developed further in 20 in-person community workshops held in cities worldwide from May to July 2023 and another 20 virtual workshops. Contents of the proposalThe proposal. consisting of approximately 2.000 lines of detailed content. outlines the framework for governance within the Cardano ecosystem. To dive deeper into the specifics. the full text of the proposal can be accessed on GitHub at\\\\xa0CIP-1694. A key feature of the proposal is its voting mechanism. which operates on a one lovelace. one vote basis. ensuring that voting power corresponds directly to the amount of ADA participants hold. Governance actionsGovernance actions existed on the Cardano blockchain before this CIP. but this proposal expands their definition and scope. A governance action is an on-chain event triggered by a transaction. It has a deadline after which it cannot be enacted. Three entities can vote on governance actions: the constitutional committee. delegated representatives (DReps) (including direct voters). and stake pool operators. Table 1. The seven types of governance actions. Any ada holder can submit a governance action to the chain. They must provide a deposit. which is returned when the action is finalized (whether it is ratified or has expired). Cardano constitutionThere must be a constitution. Its contents are out of the scope of the CIP. it is an off-chain text document. There must be a constitutional committee. Its role is limited to voting on the constitutionality of governance actions. so it can only vote on actions 3 through 7. If it steps outside this role. it can be replaced via a motion of no confidence. DRepsTo participate in governance. Ada holders will generally delegate their voting rights to a registered DRep who will vote on their behalf. Any ada holder may register as a DRep or direct voter. If an ada holder delegates to abstain. their stake is actively marked as not participating in governance. It is a way to opt out of participating in decision-making within the governance system. No confidence. If an ada holder delegates to no confidence. their stake is counted as a yes vote on every no-confidence action and a no vote on every other action. Incentives for ada holders to delegateThere is a short bootstrapping phase during which rewards are earned for stake delegation. although rewards will continue to be earned as before. This helps to ensure high participation and. thus. they are recovered. They can be withdrawn once a stake credential (including a pre-defined voting option) is delegated.',\n",
       " ' Incentives for DRepsDReps arguably need to be compensated for their work. RationaleThe rationales for many of the decisions made in developing this improvement proposal are recorded in the CIP itself. This improvement proposal is probably the most important in Cardano’s history. It transfers the blockchains control from its founding entities to the people who care most. the community of ada holders. Well explore these areas more fully as they are implemented through Chang and Plomin hard forks.Welcome to this weeks Intersect dev update! Dive in as we review the “Plomin hard fork” info-action. Cardano Constitution updates. how to interact with DReps. continuing Budget awareness. and critical Hard Fork updates. Check out governance action updates. Govtool. and Parameter changes. updates from our core teams and social channels. and more!. Chang Hard Fork updatePlomin hard fork (a current on-chain proposal)The Intersect hard fork working group has proposed naming the next Cardano hard fork the “Plomin hard fork” in memory of Cardano community contributor Matthew Plomin. Matthew Plomin was an exemplar of the Cardano community. representing everyone ready to pick up the torch and carry the ecosystem forward. Matthew was a much-loved and respected member of the Cardano community. He passed unexpectedly on November 14. There is a tradition of naming hard forks in memory of notable historical figures or significant contributors to the Cardano community. Naming this hard fork in memory of Matthew Plomin would memorialize his lifelong actions of selflessly supporting and contributing to the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. Renaming the second Chang hard fork (Chang #2) to the Plomin hard fork. in memory of Cardano community contributor Matthew Plomin. reflects a natural progression of Cardano’s governance growth. The Chang hard fork. a two-part upgrade. was named after Phil Chang. who sadly passed away in 2022. Phil Chang was an employee of Input\\\\xa0|\\\\xa0Output who made significant contributions to Cardano’s governance system. helping to transfer the blockchains control and responsibility into the communitys hands. On behalf of the hard fork working group. Intersect has raised a governance information action for the Cardano community to consider. You can also view this governance action via cexplorer. \\\\xa0cardanoscan. or CF explorer. Tracking the Cardano constitution journey: latest draft releasedFollowing the conclusion of the latest delegate synthesis workshop on November 16th. the latest community-driven draft is now available. The latest draft remains a work in progress and may be different from the one shared at the Constitutional Convention. pending tweaks and adjustments requested by delegates. Drafting the Constitution has been and continues to be an iterative process. involving nearly 1400 community members and now 126 elected delegates and alternates representing their communities’ views. During the consultation process. alternative variations and iterations of a constitution emerged. These have ranged from changes in language and simplifications to more fundamental challenges to principles and statements. Much discussion and idea-sharing has taken place on social media. particularly on X. Still. there are notable exceptions where supporting materials and documentation have been published and shared. Cardano community member Cerkoryn recently published an excellent thread linking other materials and contributions.',\n",
       " ' including their own. plus Adam Dean. Jane. Alfonso Spencer. Collin Smith. This list is not exhaustive. but alongside the thousands of hours spent deliberating the draft Constitution through the workshops and Cardano Civic Committee. it’s evident how much effort has been made. Next StepsThe draft will soon undergo an off-chain vote by elected delegates. requiring a 51% majority for approval. If passed. the text will move to an on-chain vote. where it must achieve a 75% DRep approval threshold and a two-thirds majority vote by the interim Constitutional Committee. New Convention microsite!Launching today. a microsite to host and connect the Constitutional Convention to the Cardano community. The microsite includes an indicative schedule (subject to change pending delegate progress). and an open-invite to the signing ceremony. Head to cardanoconvention. com to find out more and RSVP. DReps - delegated representativesWe’re excited to remind you about our weekly meetings. Committees and working groupsAs Intersect continues to evolve. October 2024 marked a historic moment with our first-ever full-scale elections for our committees and governing board. This significant milestone. achieved with the active participation of our global community. reflects the spirit of inclusivity and collaboration that underpins our organization. Following the elections. each committee comes together to elect its chair. The Budget Committee continues to provide open “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) sessions across different time zones and days. seeking wide input from the Cardano ecosystem regarding the annual budget process. Through these sessions. committees have begun presenting their proposals to the community. The Product Committee. Technical Steering. and Membership and Community Committees have each given their proposals and taken questions. The Civics Committee is scheduled to present in the coming days. Intersect encourages participation in the consultation phase through surveys. Rebranding for Clarity: CDF Becomes CDHWhen Intersect was established in December 2023. it assumed the Cardano Development Foundation (CDF) administrator role. The financial vehicle was created to support the ongoing maintenance and development of the Cardano blockchain. A request to rename the Cardano Development Foundation was made to serve our members better and avoid confusion with the Cardano Foundation. Following thorough discussions with the Intersect Board and the foundations legal counsel. we are pleased to announce that it will now be known as Cardano Development Holdings (CDH). This name change underscores our commitment to clarity and distinction within the ecosystem while continuing to uphold our mission. As we move through the budget process. much more detail will be shared about the CDH. its structure and how it operates. Product committeeIn an update. the Cardano Product Committee reports that they presented at the recent Budget Committee open calls. sharing the current state of the proposed 2025 Cardano common goals and inviting everyone to participate in the consultation. The committee members and various SMEs are now discussing how to structure a first draft of the research budget proposal. which will be presented for feedback and consultation at the beginning of December. they congratulate Samuel Leathers and Kyle Solomon on being elected as Chair and Co-Chair of the Cardano Product Committee.',\n",

Governance toolingAs part of the hard fork readiness activities. the Govtool team began the week by upgrading DBSync and node versions to their latest releases. 1 and 10. respectively. During this process. we encountered some challenges with the data migration. which required a total resync. GovTool could not display data related to DReps and Governance Actions. This led us to activate the maintenance page until either a workaround could be calculated or the resync was completed. We are happy to report that GovTool is now back online and preparing for another release next week. This update will ensure compatibility with the upcoming hard fork and support for all governance action types outlined in CIP-1694. Cardano GovTool is currently in its bootstrapping phase. with a second hard fork planned in the coming weeks to enable full governance. All teams are working to ensure this transition supports full governance while maintaining system stability. Updates can be followed on SanchoNet. and the core-gov-tool-announcement Discord channel.

The draft ConstitutionDrafting the Constitution has been and continues to be an iterative process. involving nearly 1400 community members and 126 elected delegates and alternates representing their communities’ views. Throughout the entire consultation process. Cardano community member Cerkoryn recently posted an excellent thread linking other materials and contributions. including their own plus: Adam Dean. but these contributions and drafts highlight the robust engagement of the Cardano community. showcasing a wide spectrum of ideas that have been invaluable in shaping and refining what delegates will vote on at the Constitutional Convention. Following the conclusion of the seventh delegate synthesis workshop on November 16th. Learning more and providing feedbackThere are several ways to engage with the draft Constitution. The community-elected delegates are the best resource for understanding the progression of the Constitution text. You can also contact the Civics Committee via the channel #cardano-civics-committee on Intersect’s Discord server. We have also provided. alongside the latest draft. some supporting material designed to assist with reading. understanding. and contextualizing the draft Constitution. It includes an outline of the role the Constitution plays in the Cardano ecosystem. a summary of the community review and global workshops. explains the function of the preamble. and tenets. and outlines. section by section. the edits. and changes that have been made to the draft following the consultation process and discussions with delegates. What happens next?The draft Constitution remains subject to change until voted on by elected workshop delegates. Very shortly. those delegates will vote on whether they. on behalf of the workshop attendees and community members they represent. accept the draft. This off-chain vote requires 51% of elected delegates’ votes to pass. Should the majority vote yes. that text version will need to be voted on on-chain; at this point. no other changes to the text are anticipated. For the governance action to pass on-chain. it must meet a DRep approval threshold of 75% and a two-thirds majority vote (the same threshold as for all governance actions) by the interim Constitutional Committee. Once we reach the milestone of ratifying. on-chain. a Constitution that the community is happy with.',\n",

Here’s what’s happening in Cardano governance and at Intersect: Cardano constitution progress. budget updates. Chang #2. the latest governance report. open-source developments. Let’s dive in!. Tracking the Cardano constitution journey: paving the way for Cardano’s first Constitutional Convention. The Cardano community has made significant strides in developing its governance framework. An interim constitution was established to maintain blockchain stability during the interim period. 65 workshops were conducted globally. engaging 1.400 participants to gather feedback for refining the draft constitution. This extensive community involvement highlights a collective commitment to establishing a robust and inclusive governance structure for Cardano. The Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires in December will mark a pivotal moment for the entire community to come together and celebrate all the work they have put in to get us to this point. Will we have a constitution we are all happy enough to ratify? We shall see. the Cardano constitution will be endorsed and ratified by the majority and have the consent of the majority. We explore these topics in this blog. A dedicated microsite for the Convention will be published next week. Keep an eye on our X account!. Watch for much more information soon as we count down to the Convention!. The budget committee has begun facilitating an essential series of open discussions focused on its proposed 2025 Cardano budget process. These structured Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions bring together members. community stakeholders. and DReps to explore the framework for managing treasury funds in the post-Voltaire era. The initial sessions addressed vital topics. including what a sustainable funding range looks like. multi-stakeholder participation mechanisms. and comprehensive oversight frameworks. To participate in any open discussion AMA. please register here. Central to these discussions is the commitment to ensure the broader community can participate in treasury governance and oversight. with Intersect serving as an administrator of a budget rather than a gatekeeper.

Pre-production hard fork governance actionThe hard fork initiation governance action for the pre-production environment is live! This action will bring protocol version 10. 0 and full governance to PreProd if enacted. You can find it here via CardanoScan. Experience and community feedback from the first upgrade indicated that the pre-production test time needed to be increased before the mainnet hard fork. This governance action now looks to address this concern. The hard fork will be enacted on-chain once the governance action has sufficient SPO and ICC votes. This action follows the ratification of the PreProd protocol parameter update gov_action1k5…n7ft. which updates the PlutusV3 cost model ready for the hard fork. This parameter update adds new costing. enabling the use of new Plutus primitives post hard fork. You can keep track of all the governance actions and their status via our knowledge base. Daedalus governance updateDaedalus 7. 0 will enable users to delegate their voting power to delegated representatives (DReps) or choose an automatic voting option (abstain or no confidence). ensuring that Daedalus users have a voice in Cardanos direction. In the new voting tab. users can select their registration preference for each wallet held in Daedalus. For more on this update. follow the Intersect knowledge base and readiness page.

Latest governance actionsAs the landscape of Cardano governance constantly changes. Current live governance actions:. Protocol parameter update - Update the Plutus V3 Cost Model:This action was intended to update the Plutus V3 cost model by adding new costing variables for the upcoming Plutus primitives enabled by the Chang #2 hard fork. upon review. we found that the action did not produce the intended on-chain effect because the new costing variables were unintentionally omitted. This was an error but an expected one at this stage. Once this was spotted. the decision was made to invalidate the action’s metadata to discourage voting. You can read the full report Oops! Whats up with governance action 51f4…74#0?.

Community toolingEducational grant completion: engaging young people in Cardano governanceMAV100 and the Selfdriven Foundation have completed their educational initiative. Engaging young people into Cardano governance. This project. funded through an Intersect community grant. introduces high school and university students to Cardano’s governance structures. including an in-depth look at CIP-1694. The initiative follows a structured learning journey. including hands-on group discussions. interactive tasks. and quizzes. Key learning modules cover foundational blockchain concepts. decentralized governance representatives (DReps) roles. and Cardano’s on-chain governance mechanisms. By equipping young participants with this knowledge. the program aims to foster a generation of informed community members and future governance leaders.',\n",
       " ' Voting tool for the Constitutional ConventionClarity. which is building the voting tool for the Constitutional Convention. has also completed its first milestone. This tool has two purposes. it facilitates a poll to approve or reject the current draft constitution. If approved. we want this to be a celebratory occasion for the Cardano community as a whole. and we want the tooling to reflect this by being an on-chain voting tool and creating a spectacle. You can find more out here. please visit the grant project space. Here are the latest stats:. Governance toolingWe have released a new version of GovTool. supporting CIP-129 and the change in the ada display format in voting. All updates are detailed in the release notes and are available on page 1. 26. You can also track the community backlog here. The recent governance action outcome grant winner.

November 28. at 16:00 UTC. Join here. This session will focus on gathering community perspectives on the current status of Cardano governance and expectations leading into the upcoming Constitutional Convention. If you have questions or topics you’d like addressed in future town halls. submit them using this survey link. The Town Hall Working Group is drafting a proposal to extend these sessions beyond January 2025. join the WG sessions in December or share your feedback in the Discord channel. You can also join the Town Hall WG Zoom meetings.In the endeavor to decentralize Cardanos governance. a key question arises: How can we leverage traditional institutional processes to set up the rules we need and prevent disorder while rejecting old hierarchical systems so that the community handles governance? Intersect explored this topic in this earlier article. This blog post aims to chart the Cardano constitutions journey from its inception through the interim period with on-chain governance now live on the mainnet and finally to a Cardano constitution that the community can endorse and ratify. First things first: what is an interim. a draft. and the next Cardano Constitution?. Interim constitutionIn short. the temporary set of baseline rules and guardrails secure the chain during the interim period of Cardano’s on-chain governance rollout.',\n",
       " ' The journey began with the Cardano Civics Committee of Intersect. composed of the first founding members with engineering. political. social science. law. and communications backgrounds. Along with experts and community contributors. pooled from those who engaged with the early versions of CIP-1694. constitutional experts and the Civics Committee put together an interim Constitution. a set of baseline rules and guidelines designed to secure the blockchain through the transitional period 2024. Importantly. it provides the interim Constitutional Committee with a set of rules against which to judge the constitutionality of the first submitted governance and info actions until the Cardano Constitution is ratified on-chain. The interim constitution stipulates a broad timeline (reference Appendix II). whereby a convention must take place in 2024 with delegates and traveling alternates. and an approved version of the constitution must be submitted on-chain. This provided the roadmap for the consultation process and a mark for the community to work towards. The interim constitution currently governs the Cardano blockchain and is available for all to read. Draft constitutionIn short. drawing on the interim constitution. an update taking into account community feedback. concerns. and suggestions for improvement. With the safety of the blockchain secured for this interim period. the real business of developing the Cardano constitution by and for the community opened up. an amazing 65 workshops took place across 52 countries. involving nearly 1400 community members. All focused on hearing what the community does and does not want to see in the Cardano constitution—providing feedback and inputs into evolving the draft document. This ranged from removing and adding statements to simplification of language and procedural points to how the constitution should be interpreted. For no incentive other than the collective furtherance of Cardano’s governance. the dedication and commitment—and sheer number of hours—put in by the community cannot be overstated. Thank you to all who contributed. The synthesis processTo synthesize and make meaningful use of such a large volume of input and information. a difficult balance had to be struck between structuring the workshops around particular themes and questions and making space for all views to be heard. all workshops were asked. ‘What other feedback would you like to provide?’ During the first workshops. feedback was also shared with the Civics Committee on their structure and format. allowing them to become more flexible and adaptable during the latter stages of the series. Adding to the process. additional synthesis workshops with delegates were organized in Costa Rica and Kenya earlier this month. Adhering to the interim constitution. the Civics Committee ensured that workshops covered a broad geographical mix. for those unable to travel. Intersect facilitated a process for submitting individual feedback. sharing the same information with individual contributors as in-person workshop attendees had access to. This process garnered further responses from community members who might otherwise have been unable to participate. Following the conclusion of the workshops. the Civics Committee has been engaging with the elected delegates and alternates. who are representatives of the wider workshop cohort. sharing and collaborating on proposed changes to the drafts text.',\n",
       " ' The draft constitution itself is. of course. lengthy. detailed. and complex. and necessarily so for a document tasked with supporting and securing a global and sophisticated blockchain. but the Civics Committee has also strived to synthesize it into as concise and accessible a document as possible - the guardrails. or script. that are essential for enforceability by the Constitutional Committee make up the bulk of the document. Credit must go to the almost 1400 community members who have read. and provided valuable and meaningful feedback on such a document. Hearing from the community. Hosting this workshop brought home the power of community in Cardano —\\\\xa0 every voice. from every background.\\\\xa0 is encouraged to contribute to the shared vision as we continue moving into Voltaire. Seeing all these perspectives brought together in this way reinforced my personal why I’m passionate about Cardano — it’s not just the technology. it is genuinely a collective effort to shape a fairer future. The Edinburgh workshop was. for me. a real-life demonstration that Cardano’s governance isn’t dictated from the top down but is built from the ground up. giving real voices to every ADA holder.  - Larisa McFarlane. Constitutional workshop host. Edinburgh. Hosting the Constitutional Workshop in Oslo made me even more passionate about our work with the Constitution and highlighted the importance of what we are doing.  - Beatrice Anihiri. Oslo. The Cardano constitutionThe Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires in December will mark a pivotal moment for the entire community to come together and celebrate all the work they have put in to get us to this point. the Cardano constitution will be one that is endorsed by and has the consent of the whole community. Alternative approachesAs a membership body for the Cardano community. Intersect has strived to facilitate an open. and inclusive consultation process while recognizing that it hasn’t been perfect. No one membership body can speak for or on behalf of an entire ecosystem. especially one as diverse and globally distributed as Cardano. and nor should it intend to. No community is entirely homogeneous; a broad and diverse range of views. opinions. and approaches exists within every community. the Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires is a moment to review and approve this draft constitution. as we all know. Cardano is a permissionless system. and the spirit of decentralization means that alternative constitutions may make their way on-chain. Intersect strives to listen to its members. act on their instructions. and champion a constitution produced with as much community involvement as possible. adapting and responding to the community’s wishes as we govern Cardano together. supporting a robust and sustainable. decentrally governed blockchain long into the future.Welcome to this weeks Intersect dev update!

The Intersect Budget committee coordinates and compiles inputs from other committees. ultimately shaping a proposed budget for on-chain consideration. the Cardano ecosystem will collectively decide which initiatives the treasury should fund in 2025 and beyond. including core infrastructure improvements. marketing. Determining how to use Cardano’s treasury and manage its finances will. inevitably. spark debate. Throughout 2024. Intersect has been managing several suppliers developing Cardano’s core infrastructure. Using seed capital provided by EMURGO and Input Output | Global. Intersect members have delivered over 80 milestones so far this year. with Intersect as the counterparty and providing oversight to the work. If approved on-chain. Intersect may continue facilitating future budgets. including managing contracts with suppliers to achieve budget goals. working closely with the product roadmap. overseeing milestones. and conducting technical reviews. scrutiny. and auditing. While decentralized decision-making is driven by on-chain community voting. Intersect’s role is to facilitate by providing the machinery and oversight required to manage the processes we need as a community. We approached the concept of an annual budget for Cardano by establishing a budget committee to gather input from our membership base and the broader Cardano community. Our approach aligns with our core values: keeping “Cardano first”. informing (not dictating). staying transparent. and practicing servant-leadership. In addition to these values. the budget committee has outlined the following principles for the budget process:. the budget is a financial roadmap and plan for determining the resources required to move Cardano forward and allocating those resources to various projects and initiatives within the Cardano ecosystem - while ensuring transparency and accountability. Here’s an overview of the current process:. November and December 2024. Q1 2025. The budget process outlined above captures the off-chain components to having a draft proposal ready for on-chain consideration. Cardano’s on-chain governance necessitates checks and balances before a budget becomes funded and active. Step 1: An info action will need to be submitted to determine the treasury net-change limit. This limit defines how much ada can be withdrawn from the treasury in a given period. DReps will vote to confirm this value. Step 2: Once a draft proposal is ready. the proposed budget will be submitted as an info action to be voted on by the ICC and DReps (and must be aligned to the net-change-limit). A proposal will pass if 50%+ DRep active stake approves. Step 3: If the proposal passes. corresponding treasury withdrawal action(s) can be submitted for a further vote by the ICC and DReps. At the recent Cardano Summit in Dubai. the Budget committee presented the current status of the process and how people can get involved. The session provided valuable insights on overall budget value. fiscal policy. voting with ada from the budget. off- and on-chain approvals (and how often they are sought). and other key considerations. Many of these are contentious with a scale of approaches that we can take as an ecosystem. All of these areas remain open in the consultation phase and are undetermined.',\n",

To ease adoption. the upgrade has been implemented in two main phases: Chang #1 and Chang #2. This second phase. Chang upgrade #2. will move the Cardano blockchain out of the bootstrap governance it has been operating under since Chang upgrade #1. This has allowed a necessary step change for initial onboarding and governance participation. Impact on the Cardano ecosystem. This Chang upgrade #2 affects the Cardano ecosystem as full on-chain governance comes online. Since September 1st. every ada holder can participate by delegating to delegate representatives (DReps) or standing to become a DRep themselves. More can be found on DReps here. Important note: Following the Chang #2 upgrade. ada holders will need to delegate to a DRep to withdraw staking rewards. Rewards will continue to accrue to the ada holder typically. regardless of whether or not a DRep is delegated to. withdrawals will only be possible once an ada holder has delegated to a DRep or chosen the auto-abstain/no-confidence option. Delegate or become a DRep now. Technical Details. As per any major release. the community is advised to refer to the full release notes regarding node 10. which can be found here on the Intersect GitHub repository. There are a number of potentially breaking changes to be aware of. including modifications to era-agnostic commands. The hard fork working group will hold a number of technical Q&A sessions. which will be announced soon and found through the Intersect Discord events calendar. The governance design. including the interim constitution. states that a hard fork governance action needs to pass two thresholds for this upgrade to be enacted on the chain. Hard fork enactment will require a constitutional vote from the Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC) and a vote of 51% by stake from SPOs. Once these have been met. the hard fork will be enacted on the chain following a one-epoch ratification period. Notes for SPOs. exchanges and DApps. Like all previous upgrades. Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) must upgrade to the latest mainnet. hard fork-capable node candidate. version 10. Details on the latest releases can be found on Intersect GitHub. Intersect will coordinate updates and share information on downstream components needing upgrading to ensure compatibility. Separately and importantly. SPOs must vote on the hard fork governance action once they assess the ecosystem as being ready. There are no special requirements for Exchanges and DApps for this inter-era hard fork other than to reference the release notes and upgrade. Decentralized applications may need to be prepared by testing with the latest node release. Specific changes required will vary DApp to DApp. Exchanges play a critical role in Cardanos liquidity and stability.',\n",
       " ' They must ensure their systems are compatible with the new node to support seamless transactions and operations post-upgrade. Timeline and Expectations. The timeline for Chang upgrade #2 will be determined by interim constitution and enacted upon approval from the ICC and SPOs. The knowledge base provides further breakdown and details of these. Intersect will host and facilitate a similar ecosystem readiness page as previous hard forks. presenting the latest status across Cardano. The readiness page will reference governance actions about the upgrade so that you can follow the sequence and status as we move through the upgrade process. What happens after Chang upgrade #2. Following a successful Chang #2 hard fork. decisions on the Cardano blockchain will be shaped and voted on via fully decentralized governance. as detailed in CIP-1694. There are many exciting ways to participate in this new governance. Stay Informed and Engaged. Visit the Chang Timeline & Dependencies on Intersect’s Knowledge Base and follow our social accounts to stay updated with the hard fork working groups progress over the coming weeks. The Chang upgrade is a monumental step toward decentralized governance in Cardano. By empowering the community with the tools and infrastructure needed to guide the protocols development. Intersect is fostering a more inclusive and democratic ecosystem. As we approach the final stages of preparation. the Cardano community’s participation and readiness will be crucial in achieving a seamless transition to this new governance era. Stay tuned for more updates as we approach the hard fork event.Looking back at the constitutional workshops and forward to the conventionThe Cardano community has been hard at work these past months. and it’s important to celebrate and reflect on the journey so far. The end of the constitutional workshop series marks a pivotal milestone on the road to the constitutional convention. which will take place in Buenos Aires. from Wednesday. December 4. to Friday. Cardano’s constitution. The Voltaire phase of Cardano’s development involves transforming the network into a self-sustaining system. beginning with an interim constitution. as required by CIP-1694. The next step is to engage the community in creating an official constitution. Intersect has embarked on a series of constitutional workshops to ensure that as many voices as possible are heard. Running the constitutional workshops. Intersect called for applications from community members willing to host a constitutional workshop and received a great response. 63 applications were accepted. and Intersect awarded grants to successful applicants to run their local workshops. 64 workshops (including a pilot kindly hosted by the Cardano Foundation) took place from the beginning of August to mid-October. The civics committee has collected a wealth of valuable data and insight from the workshops. This will feed into the final draft. which the delegates at the constitutional convention in Buenos Aires will vote on. A global effort. The completed workshops covered \\\\u202f51 countries in six of the seven continents. Each workshop focused on three to six questions. each with various topics. With over 1.400 participants. the community engagement level has been nothing short of inspiring.',\n",

After the Chang upgrade. Cardano’s current behavior and future are determined by the ada holders with the most stake in its success. Individual holders can vote on governance actions. or they can choose to delegate their power to registered representatives. similar to how they can delegate their stake to stake pool operators(SPOs). Delegated representatives(DReps) are ada holders who register on-chain. allowing other community members to delegate their voting power to them. They act as parliamentary representatives in Cardano’s decentralized governance system. A DReps voting power is defined by the total amount of ada staked with them.',\n",
       " ' giving them considerable influence when governance decisions need to be made. Becoming a DRep. Any ada holder can become a DRep. and the process is straightforward. They must register via a platform like\\\\xa0GovTool. which provides a user-friendly interface for managing on-chain governance actions. More details on how to become a DRep can be found\\\\xa0here. Once registered. DReps take on significant responsibilities as defined by\\\\xa0CIP-1694. These responsibilities include:. When a DRep votes on a governance action. they vote with all the power delegated. This means they act not only for themselves but for every ada holder who has entrusted them with their voting power. This delegation and voting mechanism ensures that decisions in Cardano’s governance are weighted based on the amount of ada backing each DRep. Cardanos governance structure: three pillars. To fully understand a DReps role in Cardano. its essential to look at the broader governance structure. which rests on three foundational pillars:. On-chain decision-making: defined by CIP-1694. this system brings governance actions on-chain. allowing every ada holder to participate directly or indirectly via a DRep. Cardano constitution: a set of guiding principles that inform governance decisions and help ensure consistency in Cardano’s development. Institutions: organizations like Intersect. Project Catalyst. the Cardano Foundation. and Input\\\\xa0|\\\\xa0Output(IO) play pivotal roles in supporting and shaping Cardano’s governance. These three areas are intertwined and provide a comprehensive governance framework that drives both on and off-chain outcomes. Roles in on-chain governance. As described in CIP-1694. Cardano’s governance revolves around three key roles:. who represent the ada holders who delegate their voting power to them. Constitutional committee (CC). a body maintaining and upholding Cardano’s on-chain constitution. Learn more about the CC on the Intersect knowledge base. Stake pool operators (SPOs). who are vital for maintaining the blockchain’s operational security and governance. Learn more about stake pool operations on the Cardano website. Various combinations of these roles are involved in reviewing and voting on different types of governance actions. some actions may require the constitutional committees approval. while a combination of DReps and SPOs will decide others. A governance action (GA) is a proposal initiated by a transaction submitted on-chain for voting. Governance actions have a set expiration period after which they are no longer valid. These actions encompass a broad range of proposals. from protocol updates to treasury withdrawals. The types of governance actions defined by CIP-1694 include:. Intersect voting tutorial. Since the first Change upgrade (Chang #1). all ada holders have been able to delegate an amount of stake equal to their ada holding to one or more delegated representatives (DReps). Any ada holder can submit a governance action. but casting votes and interacting with these actions requires access to tools. While some may prefer using the command line interface. platforms like GovTool offer a more user-friendly experience with a graphical interface. Voting with GovTool. If you don’t have one. create a compatible wallet and put something in it. Go to https://gov. tools and click the Connect Wallet button. From this point on. follow the GovTool tutorial.',\n",

The future of voting and governance. The Chang upgradeCardano’s governance is set to undergo an important upgrade known as Chang #2. This upgrade aims to decentralize the decision-making process further and strengthen the role of DReps in governance. It will introduce new mechanisms for distributing voting power more equitably. ensuring that large ada holders do not monopolize the governance process. After Chang #2. the overall governance flow will see DReps taking on an even more central role. They will need to actively engage with the community. lobbying for votes and discussing governance actions to represent the best interests of the Cardano ecosystem. As voting power will be recalculated at every epoch. DReps must maintain a continuous dialogue with the ada holders who delegate to them. providing regular updates on their voting decisions and stances. Transparency and accountability are critical in a decentralized system like Cardano’s. By holding DReps accountable. ada holders ensure their voices are heard and that governance actions reflect the communitys will. As Cardano evolves. so will the role of DReps within its governance. They are crucial to ensuring a fair and democratic decision-making process. DReps must be more engaging. fostering relationships with their delegators and actively participating in governance actions. Make a difference and get involved. Think you have what it takes to be a DRep? Any ada holder can become a DRep by registering through platforms like GovTool. DReps are responsible for submitting. reviewing. and voting on governance actions for all those who delegate their voting power. For those looking to get involved. now is the time. Whether youre an ada holder considering becoming a DRep or simply looking to delegate your voting power. the future of Cardano governance is in your hands.As Intersect continues to evolve. There is also a link to the audit results. conducted by DQuadrant.

This presentation aims to provide stakeholders and community members with a clear understanding of how the budget has been developed. its purpose. and the tangible value it will deliver. The committee will cover several key points during their presentation:. The purpose of the Cardano budget: the presentation will start by outlining the core purpose of the 2025 budget. which is to fuel sustainable growth and innovation within the Cardano ecosystem. The committee will explain how the budget is designed to drive key infrastructure development. enhance community engagement. support decentralized governance. and fund impactful projects that align with Cardano’s long-term vision of a fully decentralized and scalable blockchain network. The process of collating the budget: next. the committee will examine the rigorous process of compiling the budget. This involves a transparent and collaborative approach to which multiple stakeholders—including technical teams. governance bodies. and community representatives—have contributed. How the budget will be managed: attendees will be provided with an overview of the governance framework that will guide the management of the 2025 budget. The committee will explain the mechanisms for monitoring. and adjusting the budget as necessary to respond to evolving challenges and opportunities. This section will focus on maintaining transparency and accountability. including regular reporting and community oversight. to ensure that funds are allocated efficiently and effectively. The value to be delivered in 2025: one of the most anticipated parts of the presentation will be exploring the expected outcomes from the 2025 budget. The committee will provide a view of each committees deliverables in 2025. Next steps in the process: to conclude.',\n",
       " ' the committee will outline the next steps following the presentation of the 2025 budget. This will include a timeline for implementation. community feedback sessions. and the final approval process through Cardano’s on-chain governance mechanisms. They will emphasize the importance of ongoing collaboration with stakeholders to ensure that the budget is agile and adaptable. meeting the dynamic needs of the ecosystem as it evolves throughout the year. they will touch on how lessons learned during the 2025 cycle will shape future budgets. ensuring continuous improvement in budget planning and execution. Stay tuned to Intersect channels for further updates from the budget committee. Chang #2 hard fork progressIn November 2024. the process to enact the Chang upgrade begins. ushering in a critical phase for Cardano’s governance evolution. While governance is in bootstrap mode. the decision to upgrade will be determined by Cardano’s stake pool operators(SPOs) reaching the required threshold and the Interim constitution committee(ICC) voting ‘yes’ accordingly. The ICC cannot vote ‘yes’ until 90 days after Chang #1. as set out in the interim constitution. Delegated representatives(DReps) do not vote during the hard fork process; they only become part of governance after Chang #2 has been enactedIntersect’s role is to help coordinate and facilitate Cardano upgrades. which intrinsically involve our members and the broader Cardano community. We will provide regular updates on the upgrades progress. including any developments or changes to the timeline. The current roadmap anticipates a pre-release of Cardano node v10 for testing in mid-October. DReps - Cardano governance explainedWith the Chang upgrade. Cardanos governance is driven by ada holders. who can either vote directly on governance actions (GA) or delegate their power to registered Delegated Representatives (DReps). much like delegating to stake pool operators. The upcoming Chang #2 upgrade will further decentralize decision-making and strengthen DReps’ roles by ensuring a more equitable distribution of voting power. preventing large holders from monopolizing governance. DReps will play a crucial role in the governance process by actively engaging with the community. lobbying for support. and advocating for the best interests of the Cardano ecosystem. Continuous communication with ada holders is vital. as DReps must regularly update their delegators on their voting stances and governance decisions. By maintaining this dialogue. DReps can build trust and ensure their actions align with the communitys will while encouraging broader participation in governance. Becoming a DRepThink you have what it takes to be a DRep? Any ada holder can become a DRep by registering through platforms like GovTool. This requires DReps to lobby for support and maintain transparency in their actions to uphold the trust of their delegators. This system ensures that decisions in Cardano’s governance reflect the community’s voice. More details on becoming a DRep can be found here.

GovTool. aligned with CIP-1694. allows ada holders to participate in Cardano governance via an intuitive interface for web wallets and DApps. Its core features include browsing for DReps to delegate to. registering as a DRep (with auto-generated metadata files). and proposing governance actions. DReps are empowered to vote and manage their profiles directly. refer to the Cardano GovTool documentation. compatible wallets. and known issues. GovTool on the mainnet is in its bootstrapping phase. CC-PortalThe CC-Portal will undergo several enhancements in the coming weeks. primarily focusing on improving navigation and overall user experience. Governance in numbersAs we progress following Chang upgrade #1. October 11.The second controlled hard fork completes the metamorphosis of Cardano to the age of Voltaire. The culmination of the Chang upgrade represents a transformative moment for Cardano’s governance. marking a pivotal shift that will have large-scale and lasting effects on the entire ecosystem. Throughout its journey. Cardano has embraced the butterfly as a symbol. a nod to the ‘butterfly effect’ — the idea that even small. seemingly insignificant actions can lead to vast. unforeseen consequences. Much like the delicate flutter of a butterflys wings. the Chang upgrade sets changes that will ripple across the network. profoundly influencing its future trajectory. A new era for Cardanos community. This article outlines the roadmap and timeline for when Cardano. now poised for a new era. will genuinely spread its wings. The networks future will be entrusted to its vibrant community of ada holders. who will play a decisive and integral role in shaping its decentralized governance and pushing its evolution to new heights. In November 2024. DReps do not vote during the hard fork process; they only become part of governance after Chang #2 has been enacted. Ecosystem readiness and voting period. as facilitators. will summarize readiness through an ecosystem readiness page. Although it is unlikely. the ICC may vote independently of what the page shows. The voting period for all participants ends at the same time. three epochs (15 days) after the ICC can vote ‘yes’. Your participation is crucial. Chang #2 requires five governance actions to be successfully enacted on chain. In this bootstrap phase of governance. the ICC and SPOs will be required to vote on these accordingly. Intersect will raise the required governance actions. as per the recommendations provided by the parameters sub-committee for Plutus parameter updates and the civics committee for Chang #2. moving Cardano out of bootstrap into full governance. Should the community ratify the hard fork. the upgrade will be enacted. bringing Cardanos final governance features as defined by CIP-1694. What happens If the vote doesnt pass?.',\n",
       " ' If the first epoch vote does not ratify the hard fork. the community will have additional opportunities to decide the upgrade’s next steps. Voting will remain active for six epochs. after which the governance action will expire. and the upgrade will be put on hold until new governance action(s) are raised. Post-vote success: a smooth transition. If a successful vote favors ratification. the hard fork will be enacted five days later (one epoch). ensuring a smooth and measured transition. Following the hard fork. through the hard fork working group. Intersect will provide essential technical support to help guide the network and its participants through the changes. While this technical support is initially expected to be critical. we anticipate it will become optional after ten days as the ecosystem stabilizes and participants grow accustomed to the new governance framework. The timing of governance actions is crucial to avoid the holiday season in major regions like the US. the UK. and Western Europe. This overlap could influence participation. and available support levels during the enactment period. It’s important to note that this timeline hinges on the successful release and testing of Cardano node v10. Roadmap and testing phases. This crucial phase will initiate thorough testing across multiple environments. starting with the preview and preprod testnets. Each testnet will serve as an essential proving ground to ensure that the upgrade functions as expected under varying conditions before it is ultimately deployed on the mainnet. Intersect’s role in facilitating the upgrade. Intersect’s role is to help coordinate and facilitate Cardano upgrades. Bookmark our dedicated knowledge base area to keep abreast of progress and updates. we will continue communicating through our standard channels—including the Intersect Discord HF and Announcements channels. Intersect X (formerly Twitter). and our weekly development report. ensuring that our community remains fully engaged and up to date.Under Intersect’s influence. the communitys development of the core Cardano code has widened significantly. It’s no secret that Cardano. the highly efficient and reliable top-tier blockchain. has been the brainchild of Input\\\\xa0|\\\\xa0Output(IO) and its founding partners since 2015. IO’s vision has always been that Cardano will belong to the whole world. and with the arrival of the Voltaire era. that vision is approaching achievement. Several organizations have formed a unique community of developers with a shared vision for a better future. You can read about these organizations on the Intersect website. Intersect is a member-based organization for Cardano. The Chang upgrade transferred control from the pioneering entities to the community of ada holders and established an entirely new governance regime. Intersect facilitated the Chang upgrade and established processes and procedures to ensure that Cardano will continue to be developed by best-in-class developers following fundamental research. Intersect’s efforts are already producing encouraging results. This blog will first present the results. followed by the backstory explaining how the results are the inevitable consequence of the structures. policies. and procedures that Intersect has implemented.

As scheduled on Sunday. September 1. at 21:44:00 UTC. the Cardano blockchain upgraded. bringing on-chain decision-making to the network. Taking another significant decentralization step. becoming an ecosystem governed solely by its community of ada holders. As expected. the chain continued to run uninterrupted. as it has since inception. There were no emergency calls. and the top-class engineers on standby were not needed. As we crossed the epoch boundary. an issue surfaced that. under certain circumstances. restarting a node took up to two hours longer than it should because it replayed from Genesis instead of resyncing from where it left off. Through Intersect’s newly established incident response team. engineers from across the ecosystem identified and solved the issue. releasing a new version of the Cardano node. v9. as a hotfix less than 24 hours after the hard fork. The engineers recommend that all nodes upgrade to v9. The v9. 0 upgrade introduced some improvements to the transaction cost model that DApps must consider.

Cardano. with the active participation and support of its community. reached a historic milestone by successfully executing the Chang hard fork #1. This pivotal upgrade. a testament to collective efforts. represents a significant leap forward in Cardanos ongoing journey toward fully decentralized governance. The Chang hard fork is not just a technical advancement; it embodies the Cardano communitys commitment\\\\xa0to evolving the blockchain infrastructure to support a more democratic and community-driven decision-making model. a member-based organization. champions and coordinates Cardano’s progression from being one of the most decentralized blockchains to its end goal of a fully decentralized. community-governed ecosystem. The hard fork working group comprises specialist members charged with communicating with all the stake pool operators. centralized exchanges. and decentralized application developers that make up the network operators—the node runners. The working group has set objectives. communicated target dates. and enlisted technical expertise to help it be ready in time. When a sufficient number of the node runners had communicated their readiness. Intersect met. voted. and decided to initiate the first Chang hard fork.',\n",
       " ' commemorating Phil Chang. is a testament to years of rigorous research and collaboration across the blockchain community and sets a new benchmark for the industry. Phil Changs significant contributions to Cardanos governance strategies and the Voltaire concept have left a lasting impact. Despite his untimely passing in 2022. Phil’s vision shapes Cardano’s evolution. This upgrade establishes Cardano’s entry into the Conway era and sets the stage for the Voltaire development phase\\\\xa0– a self-sustaining and community-governed blockchain. A Cardano improvement proposal (CIP) provides information to the Cardano community describing new features or processes for Cardano. You can read all about the CIP process here. The Chang upgrade is the implementation of CIP-1694. representing\\\\xa0a significant shift toward a more decentralized and community-driven governance model and moving Cardano into the Voltaire phase. This CIP proposes the concept and outlines the process to change Cardano governance from the founding entities Input\\\\xa0|\\\\xa0Output. and Emurgo\\\\xa0to the Cardano community. The community has been actively discussing and voting on CIP-1694 since early 2023.\\\\xa0and it has become the most discussed and commented-on CIP in Cardano history. A hard fork combinator\\\\xa0is an essential tool in Cardano. designed to seamlessly integrate new protocols following a hard fork event. When a hard fork happens. it effectively splits a blockchain into two distinct branches that operate independently. with the new branch lacking the historical data of the original chain. This process typically arises from implementing significant upgrades or modifications to the blockchains protocol parameters. While hard forks are typical across blockchains. the hard fork combinator. developed by Input\\\\xa0|\\\\xa0Output. offers a unique solution tailored for Cardano. It ensures a smooth transition by merging the protocols before and after the upgrade. mitigating potential disruptions and avoiding the need for a network restart. By utilizing the hard fork combinator. Cardano can maintain the continuity of its ledger. ensuring the stability and reliability of the blockchain during significant upgrades. This approach allows multiple protocols to coexist without forcing all network nodes to update simultaneously. enhancing trust and confidence in the blockchain. The Chang upgrade unfolds in two essential phases:. Chang #1:\\\\xa0This initial phase. launched with the hard fork combinator. introduces governance capabilities to the Cardano blockchain as outlined in the Cardano improvement proposal (CIP-1694). It marks the beginning of the technical bootstrapping process. laying the groundwork for future developments. The upgrade ensures no disruption to the blockchains operation. preserving its continuous history. Chang #2:\\\\xa0Building on the foundation of Chang #1. this phase will fully transition the protocol to decentralized governance. It will activate advanced governance features. including the role of decentralized representatives (DReps) and a comprehensive governance toolkit. These enhancements will complete Cardano’s move to community-driven decision-making. Significant updates to the Cardano protocol are released as updates to Cardano node. the top-level component in the Cardano network. The networking layer is the driving force behind delivering information exchange requirements. Input | Output\\\\xa0developed and released Cardano node v9. a crucial component for the Chang upgrade. A majority of stake pool operators (by stake) and a majority of exchanges (by liquidity) have implemented it.',\n",
       " ' Decentralized application (DApp) developers are well on their way to updating their applications to leverage the new features of Cardano node v9. Several key criteria were successfully met to ensure the smooth execution of the Chang hard fork:. The forthcoming Chang #2 will represent another leap forward. fully implementing the governance mechanisms proposed in CIP-1694. This phase will enable decentralized representatives to play a crucial role in the governance process and introduce a suite of governance actions that enhance community involvement. The Chang upgrade is a technical achievement and a transformative moment for Cardano and the broader blockchain ecosystem. It underscores the collective effort of the Cardano community and sets a precedent for future decentralized governance models in the industry. As Cardano progresses toward complete decentralization. the successful execution of the Chang hard fork marks a historic achievement and a significant step toward realizing a truly self-sustaining blockchain governed by its community.Welcome to the twenty-ninth edition of the Intersect Development Report!

August 28. the hard fork working group. including representatives from the community. Emurgo. and Input\\\\xa0|\\\\xa0Output. voted unanimously to initiate the hard fork. Chang #1. This hard fork will take effect on the Cardano mainnet on September 1 and is the first of two in the Chang upgrade. To prepare for this. Intersect has been working closely with stake pool operators (SPOs). exchanges. and developers of distributed applications (DApps). The SPOs are ready. as 92% of stake is on pools running Cardano node v. Exchanges are also prepared. with 92% of liquidity held by exchanges that have been upgraded to v. Most DApps are ready. and no high-severity issues have been raised. There will be a special X Space\\\\xa0as we cross the epoch boundary! In addition. contingency plans are in place. with technical first responders on standby in case of unexpected events around the hard fork - read more here. The transaction itself. You can inspect the transaction that initiates the Chang hard fork in Cardanoscan. When that transaction takes effect at the next epoch boundary (Sunday. 2024 at 21:44:51 UTC). the Chang hard fork will occur. That will take the Cardano blockchain into the Conway ledger era and herald the start of Voltaire. (Cardano eras and phases). From then on. the seven cryptographic keys used to sign the very first block of the chain (the genesis block). termed the genesis keys. are no longer valid. The genesis keys operated using the Shelley governance model. whereby the founding entities could transfer from the treasury (for project Catalyst). update protocol parameters. and trigger hard forks. The power is transferred from the few to the many. and the blockchain is on its way to being governed solely by the community of ada holders.

As part of Voltaire. the Chang upgrade transitions the ledger into the Conway era. establishing decentralized decision-making foundations by implementing CIP-1694\\\\xa0on-chain governance mechanisms. The Chang upgrade will be implemented through Cardanos hard fork combinator (HFC). facilitating seamless transitions between protocol eras. Chang transitions the Cardano ledger era from Babbage to Conway. Let’s recall some previous upgrades:. The Chang upgrade will occur in two stages: an interim (or bootstrapping) period and complete on-chain decision-making. A hard-fork working group – composed of experts and stakeholders from the Cardano technical community – was established at Intersect earlier this year to oversee and manage the upgrades technical deployment. The first stage will be initiated by a hard fork that will be ratified by the SPOs. enabling the initial governance features and laying the groundwork for the Conway-era functionality. Preparing Cardano for a smooth transition into the Chang upgrade requires several steps. It involves managing and coordinating a complex web of stakeholders and dependencies—from core technology to supporting infrastructure. wallets. Developers and stakeholders within the Cardano ecosystem work diligently with the Chang hard fork working group to implement the necessary changes and upgrades to support the newly introduced features. The latest node version is 9. and over 90% of SPOs (by stake) and exchanges (by liquidity) have already upgraded their nodes to enable the upgrade to be scheduled. You can keep up to date with the latest on this Chang Status Page. For ada holders. the Chang upgrade will be seamless. requiring no action on their part. everyone in the community with an interest in Cardano’s future governance frameworks should stay informed about the upgrade process and any potential changes. A great way to do this is to express your interest in joining Intersect. the member-based organization helping steward the governance journey and future core operations. Please continue to check the social media channels for updates.

The hard fork working group met again this afternoon to review feedback and evidence from the community and ecosystem. Following multiple Q&As and community spaces. the news remains positive. with stake pool operators reaching their Chang readiness threshold (standing at 84% as of today).',\n",
       " ' We’ve received feedback from the community and ready statements from many leading DApps. and wallets. Many exchanges have also shown positive momentum overnight. with metrics continuing to improve. Following a go/no-go call with the working group. consensus was reached to target September 1 to initiate the hard fork. This adjustment allows Exchanges and DApps a little more time to make their necessary upgrades. ensuring the ecosystem is as ready as it can be for a significant milestone in Cardano’s journey. This is a significant moment for Cardano as it marks the first time a Cardano upgrade has involved many community members and engineers across key entities in the decision-making process. This shift in governance marks a step change in how we as a community make decisions. With Chang now imminent. the power of on-chain decision-making will be in the hands of the community. empowering each member to play a crucial role in Cardanos journey. Chang is on the launchpad. with Sunday. the next targeted date for triggering the upgrade. Just a little longer to wait. We’ll keep you updated on the communitys progress!The hard fork working group is here to help!. As part of our readiness. on August 21. the PreProd network upgrade was submitted (see transaction). the hard fork working group will hold two more open Q&As with DApps.

Last week we announced the results of the community-wide vote to elect three community members\\\\xa0to the interim CC. They will sit alongside pioneer entities Input Output Global. and EMURGO. and also Intersect. all on a 73-epoch (one year) term from the date of the Chang upgrade. As a member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem. Intersect’s core pillars are to support Cardano’s on-chain governance. to create a future product roadmap. and annual Cardano budget process. Intersect’s supporting role with Cardano’s on-chain governance includes the DRep Pioneer Program. co-ordinating the Chang upgrades. and providing constitutional support to the interim CC. While the community was busy voting for its representatives on the interim CC. Intersect put together a plan to run its seat as a member-led council - the Intersect Constitutional Council. We received 32 applications from around the community to form the council. and after evaluating with members and Intersect staff. we are delighted to announce the 10 members appointed to the council:. Our sincere thanks to all those who applied and played an important role in the ongoing Cardano governance journey. We hope to continue engaging with you on the constitutional journey. we look forward to working with the council and wider interim CC over the coming months. We are in the process of finalizing the 50 global workshops. which will begin in August. We hope as many of you as possible have your say on the drafting of the final Constitution. See the latest workshop locations and dates here.Cardano node v9. 0 has arrived! This release signifies the completion of primary development work for the bootstrap phase of on-chain governance. This milestone is crucial to realizing the decentralized governance envisioned in CIP-1694. The Cardano ecosystem is poised for a significant transformation with the upcoming Chang Upgrade. This milestone marks the installation of the core elements of decentralized governance. rolled out across two distinct phases. Intersect has been diligently working behind the scenes to build the necessary infrastructure. empowering the Cardano community to steer the protocols development and maintenance. Chang is a pivotal upgrade designed to implement decentralized governance within the Cardano blockchain. The upgrade will be executed in two main phases. Chang #1 and Chang #2. each introducing crucial governance elements that will give the community a significant say in the protocol’s evolution. The Chang Upgrade affects the entire Cardano ecosystem. particularly Stake Pool Operators (SPOs). Exchanges. and Decentralized Applications (DApps). For the upgrade to proceed. the community must reach 70% of the SPOs upgraded and 85% of Exchange liquidity on the Chang mainnet candidate. This ensures a robust and coordinated transition to the new governance model. The timeline for the Chang Upgrade will be determined by the community’s readiness and coordinated through Intersect’s Hard Fork Working Group. The final date for the hard fork will be decided when the community reaches the specified SPO and Exchange readiness thresholds.',\n",
       " ' Intersect will bring transparency to these dependencies. regularly updating the community as they meet the necessary criteria. As these elements are marked ‘green’ (ready for Chang) and near completion. confidence in finalizing a date for the hard fork combinator event will increase. Once the list of dependencies nears completion. a firm date is anticipated to be socialized. The community can refer to the Intersect GitHub releases\\\\xa0for specific details and release notes on the node. The functionality and features for Voltaire and Chang have been progressively introduced through node releases and in test environments such as Sanchonet. The final minor changes for node 9. 0 are expected to\\\\xa0focus on performance and benchmarking. so it is crucial to read the release details carefully. One notable update is within Plutus v3. accommodating CIP-69. Following the completion of Chang #1. Cardano will enter a bootstrap governance phase as outlined in CIP-1694. This period will allow for the adoption of governance features and acclimatization to new roles. Delegate Representatives will begin campaigning. and proposals will be democratized through off-chain GovTool features. After a sufficient duration. determined by technical teams. delegate representatives. and the Constitutional Committee. the bootstrap phase will end. leading to the implementation of full governance features through an inter-era hard fork. Stay updated with the Hard Fork Working Group’s progress over the coming weeks by visiting the Chang Timeline & Dependencies\\\\xa0on Intersect’s Knowledge Base. To contact the Hard Fork Working Group. watch Intersect’s channels for details on the HFWG’s subsequent Q&A sessions. held weekly on Thursdays.

One of the core pillars of Intersect is to advance and champion on-chain governance. which includes funding opportunities to ideate and develop community tooling to support Cardano’s governance. Earlier this year. we launched three grants to fund the development of governance tooling. with Intersect member Bloxico\\\\xa0selected to develop the Constitutional Committee Portal. Next up are the Proposal Discussion Forum and DRep Campaign Platform. developed by Intersect members WeDeliver and LidoNation\\\\xa0respectively. These grants are a key component for enabling Voltaire to develop the tools to increase participation and access to Cardano’s on-chain governance. ultimately intending to drive better outcomes on-chain. You can read more about governance tooling here. The interim Constitution Committee will uphold the rules and guardrails set out in the interim Constitution. maintaining the safety and security of the chain through the remainder of the interim period. We are now in the final stages of the process to establish the interim Constitution Committee - voting via the Summon platform\\\\xa0for the three community members to join Intersect and pioneer entities IOG. EMURGO and the Cardano Foundation and closes on June 23 - and the response from community members has been fantastic. With this key security in\\\\xa0place. the governance journey goes global! Over the past few weeks. we have been blown away by the response to the call for hosts to conduct a series of global consultation workshops. receiving 98 applications from 46 countries! Over the next few weeks. Intersect will award grants to workshop hosts to bring the community together. Look out for a workshop near you to get involved and have your say.Welcome to the eighteenth edition of the Intersect Development Report! We’re approximately halfway into Intersect’s first year. we are excited to update you on member-experience improvements; including Discord enhancements and changes with working groups.',\n",
       " ' we’re excited to share Messari’s Q1 report on Cardano. Voting opens for the interim Constitutional Committee seats. DRep pioneer program. Let’s get straight into the update!. We’re pleased to share Messari’s Q1 report on Cardano. Commissioned by Intersect. the report dives deep into the state of play for Cardano in Q1 of 2024!Key Insights from the report:. Read it in full. & SIGS. We are excited to confirm a member-led initiative to maximize the wealth of expertise within our membership by leveraging self-assembled Special Interest Groups (SIGs)”. These groups will enable our membership to form around topics of interest and discuss them with other members. SIGs can freeform faster. shape their purpose and objectives. and remain as SIGs into the long term as they self-determine!. SIGs are essentially working groups without a committee to which to roll up. the stablecoin and marketing working groups have no natural committee home but are equally important to our members and the broader Cardano ecosystem. To clarify this structurally within Intersect and to empower members with more flexibility and options. all existing working groups. except those already working within or supporting a committee. will be reassigned as SIGs. Conversely. they can transfer to being a working group” if a committee needs support. thus enhancing our collaborative efforts and joined-up thinking!. Documentation updates may take some time to permeate. but if you have any queries. contact the committee team\\\\xa0at Intersect. Core Infrastructure Roadmap (CIR) working groupThe CIR working group was formed at the end of April 2024 to foster an infrastructure roadmap for Cardano. This roadmap is expected to expand as external expertise and representation become necessary. the working group hopes to contribute more widely to the budgeting process for Cardano’s development plans. the group set up a regular schedule of workshops and began testing prototype processes. The current focus is on making the workstreams functional and engaging with the community. Further details can be found here.

During rebuild. new features were added. including support for direct voter registration and voting on governance actions. an easier registration process for DReps and a comprehensive DRep directory for improved transparency and selection have been added!. SanchoNet Govtool participation dashboard is now available on participation.Since its inception in 2015. Cardano has continued to evolve. striving to address previous blockchain generations’ limitations by focusing on scalability. Cardano’s development is structured into a roadmap of five meticulously designed phases. Each phase addresses specific challenges and enhances the platforms capabilities. The first two phases were developed sequentially. while the latter three were concurrent. This achieves quicker progress and seamless functionality integration. Read a progress report on the Cardano roadmap detailing each development phase and highlighting the latest updates. Byron: establishing the foundation. The Byron phase marked the beginning of Cardanos journey. focusing on establishing the networks foundational elements. During this phase. users could buy and sell ada. the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano blockchain. Key developments included:. Byron set the stage for Cardanos transition to a more decentralized and SPO-supported network. Shelley: embracing decentralization. Following Byron. Shelley introduced a critical step in Cardanos evolution. Shelley transitioned the network from a federated model to a decentralized one. where the community managed block production and transaction validation. This phase saw the creation of a new economic system. encouraging users to participate in stake pool operations and stake delegation. Shelley significantly enhanced network security. resilience. and community involvement. Goguen: expanding functionality. Goguen. which was developed concurrently with Basho and Voltaire. integrated smart contracts on Cardano and now focuses on further functionality enhancements. Key updates during this phase include the Alonzo upgrade.',\n",
       " ' which introduced smart contract capabilities through the Plutus platform. This enabled developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) and issue custom native tokens on Cardano. The Vasil upgrade extended these capabilities further. including a new version of Plutus to improve scripting and transaction efficiency. The Goguen phase continues to expand Cardanos potential. supporting a wide range of financial and business applications. Upcoming milestones include Ouroboros upgrades. further enhancements to Plutus. and the development of more advanced DApps. broadening Cardanos application scope. Basho: optimizing performance. Basho aims to optimize Cardanos performance by improving scalability and interoperability. Recent updates in this phase include the introduction of diffusion pipelining and the Vasil upgrade. Diffusion pipelining enhances block propagation times. increasing the networks throughput. while the Vasil upgrade introduced inline datums. reference inputs. and reference scripts. streamlining transaction processes. These improvements ensure that Cardano can efficiently support a growing number of users and high transaction volumes. Other interoperability and scalability solutions introduced in this phase include:. Voltaire: empowering governance. Voltaire focuses on establishing a decentralized governance model. enabling the Cardano community to participate in governance actions. This phase has seen the launch of Intersect. a member-based organization (MBO) designed to foster Cardano’s future development. and SanchoNet. a testnet for Cardano’s governance model. Voltaire will see the implementation of the Chang upgrade as part of CIP-1694. a Cardano improvement proposal that outlines on-chain governance mechanisms. The Cardano community will soon host a series of global workshops to draft the Cardano Constitution. culminating in a constitutional convention in Buenos Aires later this year. The community will vote on the constitution. marking a significant step towards decentralized governance and empowering users to shape the networks future. Cardano’s bright future. Cardano’s 2024 roadmap showcases the platforms commitment to innovation. decentralization. With significant progress made in the Goguen. Basho. and Voltaire phases. Cardano continues to set new industry standards. As the blockchain advances toward its goals. the upcoming milestones will enhance its capabilities. ensuring a secure. and sustainable blockchain ecosystem. There are many ways to get involved and contribute to the design and rollout of Cardno’s governance. spanning a broad spectrum.Welcome to the sixteenth edition of the Intersect Development Report!

Look at the complete Intersect roadmap to learn more about Intersect’s work towards full decentralization. for any additional information on the way the organization is tackling open-source initiatives. have a look here.Minimum viable on-chain governance sums up several concepts and milestones that must work together to provide a cohesive and logical next-generation governance framework. signaling the road towards on-chain Cardano governance. The governance journey begins with an interim period to allow safe bootstrapping of on-chain governance through formal governance rules. These include off-chain protections and technical guardrails to protect the chains integrity and security as Cardano upgrades into a new era. The interim Constitution is an important document encapsulating these protections and must be in place to support the Chang upgrade and the subsequent bootstrapping period. The deployment of governance features on mainnet signposts the interim period. which includes the drafting process for the final Constitution. A consultation process is now underway and will run throughout 2024. The interim period ends once a final Constitution is ratified on-chain. which is anticipated to follow the Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires. in December 2024. To uphold the interim Constitution. there will be an interim Constitutional Committee (CC) to enable the first stage of the Chang upgrade. The interim CC will focus on the technicality and base constitutionality of the very first community-submitted on-chain governance actions. each sitting for a one-year term to cover the interim period to help maintain security and continuity. and membership body Intersect. three remaining seats are open to community members to apply. Registration opens today. with voting via the Summon Platform opening later in June to elect the three remaining seats. According to one of its key pillars. and steered by the Civics Committee. Intersect will facilitate an open and inclusive election process. through which any community member interested in participating in the development of Cardano’s governance can nominate themselves. The vote will likewise be open to all ada holders. with voting power weighted by stake and ranked-choice voting to elect the three additional interim committee members. This will be a challenging and responsible role. and all appropriate training and ongoing support will be available to committee members. We are looking for community members passionate about developing Cardanos governance. Experienced community contributors who have been active and contributed in SanchoNet. and participated in the CIP-1694 workshops held in summer 2023 are particularly encouraged to apply.

Following last week’s SanchoNet respin. with the release of Node 8. 11. SanchoNet has been testing a not-seen-before governance feature. the bootstrapping phase. The bootstrapping phase is characterized by enabling only a small set of the full governance functionality. This phase will be activated after the first change hard fork. allowing DReps to register and attract delegation before fully participating in governance. The bootstrap phase can be exited via an intra-era hard fork. voted for by SPOs and constitutional committees. On the mainnet. this hard fork will be known as the second Chang hard fork. enabling full governance functionality for Cardano. Read more on Cardano’s governance milestones. And here are this weeks Stats from SanchoNet:. Intersect member LIDO Nation delivered a significant milestone in developing the DRep Campaign Platform. After a lively demonstration via the “Show us what you got” call. the LIDO Nation team opened up the project. inviting the community to come. and leave feedback. The DRep Campaign platform is hosted via sancho. DReps can create off-chain profiles linked to their on-chain actions to campaign for delegation from Ada Holders. the team has opened up the code hosted on the IntersectMBO/drep-campaign-platform. The community is encouraged to leave feedback via the integrated feedback popup or raise an issue on the GitHub repository. @ProofOfCardano recognized Govtool as having the highest GitHub activity this week. and for a good reason: GovTool is currently in maintenance and will be available again soon. as the team has been busy updating new features. such as the SanchoNet Govtool participation dashboard. which is now available on participation.

       " ' Part of this has been to create JSON representations for Cardano domain types (CIP-116). Although this could benefit wallet implementers. this standard could see wide application across Cardno’s web-based infrastructure. The next step in this initiative is to start drafting the final query layer standard CIP. with the knowledge gained through CPS-12 (the problem statement describing the motivation for a standardized query layer) and the data types described in CIP-116. Point 2: this new standard aims to document the best practices for wallet developers to follow to improve security and user experience with their wallets. The group sees this first draft as a step towards a Cardano quality standard. raising and improving wallets for all. The group invites comments and suggestions from all stakeholders. Please feel free to add comments to the GitHub pull request; see the rendered doc (for reading). Point 3: marks the approach of the final steps to the Wallet Connector initiative. and this initiative aims to produce new wallet connector standards to improve dApp-wallet communication. It kicked off at the start of the year. developing the CPS-10. which describes. in detail. issues the ecosystem has with the current landscape of wallet connectors. This new draft marks the first step to solving the issues described via CPS-10. offering a general extensible framework for Cardano wallet connectors. Intersect members Mike Hornan of ABLE pool and Summon Associations. released their next Cardano governance infographic.

This important step will be realized through the two-phase Chang upgrade. a moment that has rallied the Cardano community since its inception in 2022. Decentralized on-chain decision-making for Cardano signifies a new era. ‘Voltaire.’ where the community directs its trajectory. The introduction of Delegated Representatives (DReps) via the Chang upgrade brings liquid democracy to Cardano whereby ada holders can choose to vote directly or delegate to a DRep to vote on their behalf. This is an important step because it means not only is the community represented. but informed individuals can also make decisions and even harness the power of collectives and similar structures utilizing multisig. DRep. along with SPOs and the Constitutional Committee. collectively decide protocol parameters (including network. economic. and security). whether to initiate a hard-fork. and treasury withdrawals. Their votes. whether yes. no. or abstain. hold significant weight in determining the platforms trajectory. With such responsibilities. DReps must be well-equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate the complexities of decentralized governance effectively. Enter the DRep Pioneer Workshop Leaders Program. Developed in response to implementing governance features outlined in CIP-1694. this initiative aims to empower a significant portion of the Cardano community with the requisite expertise to effectively fulfill the role of DReps. Hosky. and Wada Global Ltd. The DRep Workshop Leaders will deliver training sessions once the course content and curriculum have been finalized. The materials aim to be versatile. enabling future DReps to self-train and grasp concepts intuitively. Information will be shared through platforms like the Intersect knowledge base and SanchoNet. ensuring accessibility to all interested individuals. We will publish the details of the courses as they become available. For those eager to explore similar opportunities. Intersect has various grant opportunities to drive inclusion and accessibility - empowering and facilitating the communitys access to Cardanos governance features. Non-members are encouraged to join Intersect to stay updated on future opportunities and grants. fostering a collaborative environment to grow and develop Cardanos ecosystem continuously. As Cardano continues its journey towards decentralized on-chain decision making. initiatives like the DRep Pioneer Workshop Leaders Program catalyze community empowerment and engagement.

Context—Datums are additional data that must be passed to Cardano smart contract scripts to interact with them. The higher-level problems. CIP-69 | Script Signature Unification proposes one solution to the first and partly to address the second problem. CIP-69 proposes making datums optional arguments for all types of scripts. These changes to Plutus and the Cardano ledger would allow for greater freedoms and usability of Plutus scripts. The hard fork working group at Intersect will be evaluating the specifications to consider including the Chang upgrade. We’ll provide an update over the coming weeks. One of our pillars facilitates Cardano’s development and continuity. Cardano continuity is defined or referred to as any approved and required technical services needed to build or fix current and future areas of the Cardano blockchain. Continuity in this definition can include new development. such as the CIP-1694 governance software. component upgrades. or testing improvements. to name a few.

After careful deliberation with a volunteer community evaluation group and ratification from the MCC. we are proud to announce the successful applicants (subject to contract) from this category are:. Ryan Wiley’s Cardano Governance MAV Dashboard: The Minimum Attack Vector (MAV) Dashboard is a tool designed for the Cardano blockchain that displays real-time governance action data through donut charts. It breaks down participation in governance actions by different groups within the Cardano community: Delegated Representatives (dReps). Stake Pool Operators (SPOs). the Constitutional Committee (CC). and an aggregated total of all groups. This allows users to quickly understand which entities hold influence over each of the proposal types based on stake-weighted delegation and voting thresholds. it will highlight specific centralization risks for proposal types that can be passed by swaying the decisions for a small. specific group of voting parties. The dashboard aims to improve transparency and facilitate informed decision-making by providing a clear. visual representation of ADA distribution by delegation. It is designed to be user-friendly. ensuring that information is easily accessible for all stakeholders involved in the Cardano ecosystem. Congratulations Ryan Wiley!. MLabs’ CIP-95 support for Cardano Transaction Library: The Cardano transaction library is to be updated to support new Conway primitives and implement a CIP-95-enabled wallet connector. Successful implementation of this proposal would benefit Cardano transaction library users. Congratulations. MLabs!.

Some of the key highlights this week: key milestones on Cardano’s governance rollout. Cardano’s “core” open source strategy. marketing working group applications. DRep Pioneer Program leaders confirmed. significant additions to our shared knowledge base. Without further ado. let’s dive in. we published a key terms and milestones overview - highlighting the governance features coming to Cardano and how on-chain decision-making will be rolled out throughout 2024. Some key takeaways include defining the difference between the “interim period” and “technical bootstrapping phase” and when the community will begin drafting the final constitution. The Open Source Program Office. steered by Intersect’s Open Source Committee (OSC). has been maturing processes and enhancing stability to effectively steward & maintain over 35 repositories (and growing) under Intersect - including Cardano’s core codebase. The OSC was the first committee established at Intersect and is currently chaired by Tweag. with DQuadrant. among others contributing as sitting members. the OSC agreed on a strategy to advance Cardano’s open-source project into the future. The documentation is rich and worth a deeper dive for all those interested. Funding opportunities at Intersect continue to evolve. with new opportunities emerging. While some have focussed on specific tooling. others have centered on improving awareness and accessibility to Cardano’s upcoming governance features. Before we update the current projects. you can learn more and view all our funding opportunities on our knowledge base. Phase 2 of this category will be out soon. It will focus on translating governance tools into multiple languages. for example: GovTool. and the Constitution. We have an exciting update on candidate selection for the DRep Pioneer program.

The next series of upgrades coming to Cardano are named after Phillip Chang. honoring his contributions to pioneering and shaping the early design and concepts described in CIP-1694. Phillip sadly passed away in 2022. There are three key governing bodies with roles on-chain to secure consent on proposals submitted by the community (otherwise known as governance actions). The three roles played by the community are:. a combination of the three roles above will vote to either ratify or reject a governance action proposal. Ratified proposals are automatically enacted on-chain using the CIP-1694 rules; rejected proposals can be revised and resubmitted for a future vote. Key terms and milestones. The interim period is designed for stability. Each of the new on-chain governance roles (DReps. and SPOs) will go through their own bootstrapping process. providing time for them and the broader community to adjust to the CIP-1694 governance mechanisms. An overview of the Interim Period. There are lots of ways to get involved and contribute to the design and rollout of Cardno’s governance. You can join one of the DRep training sessions facilitated by the community-led DRep Pioneer Program. rolling out soon. You can test the CIP-1694 features on the dedicated testnet environment. SanchoNet; deliberate parameter settings or other governance topics in committees; and collaborate on the draft constitution through an upcoming workshop series.In this 10th edition of our development report. the Marketing Working Group. The Chang upgrade. the DRep pioneer program. our incoming Members area. without further delay. on to the update. Cardano “continuity” is defined or referred to as any approved & required technical services needed to build or fix current and future areas of the Cardano blockchain. components upgrades. Continuity ultimately describes requirements and technical services that support the Cardano network daily. ensuring the chain is fit-for-purpose and forward-looking. Looking towards the 2025 Cardano budget. Intersect members will define continuity work through community processes and—with on-chain community consent—funded by the Cardano treasury.',\n",
       " ' Intersect will continue to facilitate and administrate the technical delivery of continuity as it does today. Intersect Delivery assurance function. Delivery assurance refers to the commitment & processes between continuity delivery partners to ensure the timely and reliable delivery of products. or projects - meeting specified requirements and expectations. and implementing strategies for successful & punctual delivery. The methodology to gain assurance is flexible. depending on the length. complexity. and associated delivery risks. the Delivery Assurance team is a core function at Intersect - completing tasks outlined above on behalf of the community. Intersect Cardano continuity quarterly plan. Intersect’s Delivery Assurance and Technical Operations teams have been preparing a first-of-its-kind Cardano Continuity Quarterly Plan. Drawing on seed funding from IOG and EMURGO. Intersect has signed continuity work contracts with an initial seven suppliers to deliver over 30 new functionalities and features to the network. through committees and working groups. members will play an integral role in shaping Cardanos roadmap by actively participating in developing the backlog. The development priorities. assignment of deliverables or tasks. and sustained enhancements to the core Cardano infrastructure will be guided by insights and recommendations from various specialized working groups and committees. including the pivotal TSC and. subsequently. the Delivery Assurance team within Intersect. For more detailed information and the latest updates on the continuity initiative and the activities of our Delivery Assurance team. we invite you to explore our Knowledge Base. ICYMI. we announced a new. exciting working group focused on marketing Cardano. Since the announcement. we have been inundated with interest. and we’re expecting a fantastic group of marketers and creatives. both inside Intersect and Cardano and from outside our ecosystem. We have created a quick form to capture interest more formally. We’ll be reaching out to all those who raised their hands across our social platforms. but for now. if you want to participate and contribute. please complete this form. Spearheaded by Intersect member MLaden of Anastasia Labs. we aim to hold the first kick-off in early May. Our upcoming new members area will be the home for Intersect members to navigate Intersect and their membership benefits. We are improving onboarding and making it easier for members to contribute. The development of our members area is in full swing. and we took the Membership & Community Committee (MCC) through an early-access demo for a first round of member feedback. our beta testers insights have given us high confidence in the member areas readiness. Later in May. beta testing will expand to more members. staying on track for Q2 delivery. Below is a sneak peek of the members area and an idea of how it will look when launched in beta!. Representing a significant step towards minimum viable on-chain governance as defined in CIP-1694. the Chang upgrade (spread across two upgrades) will culminate many years of hard work. including all the community participation that has taken place through community workshops and testing on SanchoNet. As stake pools upgrade their nodes to support the new protocol.',\n",
       " ' Cardano will have moved from the Basho era into the Voltaire Era. creating a self-sustaining blockchain and trailblazing the way forward for the industry. The first of two upgrades (Chang Upgrade #1) will deploy governance features to Cardano and enter the technical bootstrapping phase described in CIP-1694. The second upgrade (Chang Upgrade #2) moves CIP-1694 out of the technical bootstrapping phase and unlocks the final features of on-chain governance. including DRep participation and treasury withdrawals. The Chang upgrade will follow a similar path to the Vasil upgrade. The final decision to a hard fork will be made – in consultation with members of the SPO. DApp. and community – against three key criteria:. Intersect will coordinate hard fork activity with the community and our continuity suppliers. We will update you on our knowledge base as we progress toward Chang. Funding opportunities continue to expand. launching numerous initiatives to empower our members and propel Cardanos governance rollout. Before we jump to it. if you’d like to catch up on all the current projects in-flight. please look at our Community Grant Gitbook space. With the Open category. we have concluded our first grant category evaluation. in which the community has been involved in the process. one step closer to creating a decentralized ecosystem. The Intersect Community Members evaluated each proposal on an agreed framework. which can be found in our knowledge base. The decision will now go to the MCC for ratification before we can release the results next week. The Grant Evaluation working group has now reopened for people to apply to take part in the evaluation of the Inclusion and Accessibility Category. The form to join is available here and will close at 9 am (UTC) on Monday 22nd April. This is a reminder that the DevOps for Governance Tools grant is still open until Thursday. 25th April. This grant is open to a company in the community that will own and manage the software development operations of governance tools that will allow everyone to participate in governing Cardano. Please review the requirements and directions for applying here. The Inclusion & Accessibility category is now closed. Results are due to be announced on 10th May. The local face-to-face events and meet-ups category has been paused while we evaluate the first round of applications. This category is currently capped at 40 workshops. The same application and review process will apply as with any other grant. If you are successful. all liability and responsibility for the event will be with the host. not Intersect. We will contact the individual(s) with the results over the next few weeks. Following the installation of node 8. 10 last week. the SanchoNet testnet resets. so there are no new stats to report this week. The reset brings new functionality for pushing decentralized government forward. as the new node supports a new cost model for Plutus v3 and new Plutus byte string primitives. the Constitution Committee quorum has been renamed to the threshold in the CLI. and a new economic parameter.',\n",
       " ' minFeeRefScriptCostPerByte. has been added for reference scripts. This version of the node also adds support for reference scripts in the Conway era. the SanchoNet GovTool is being upgraded to work with the new Node 8. 0-pre and re-spun sanchonet. The Byron Networks team aims to get the GovTool back online next week. this is dependent on upgrading wallets to the new Cardano node version. the team has made the Govtool repository public at IntersectMBO/govtool. This is the first step to full community ownership of the governance tools. We invite those governance-mad community members to start having a look. Feel free to raise feature requests or bug reports via the Issues. We are improving our contributing guide for those keen developers to allow your appreciated contributions. You will also be able to follow the development progress of this GitHub project. As we progressed in developing the new features of Govtool. the WeDeliver Team started implementing the new proposal discussion area. This and the other new features will be available in Q2 for testing on sanchogov. this week. the Governance Tools Working Group met for the third time. This working group is responsible for defining how to decentralize these tools ownership. and maintenance to the Cardano community. You can join the discussion on the working group Discord channel. Update from Teamz - Japan. Intersect returned to Tokyo for the Teamz blockchain event to share the latest plans with Cardano’s governance rollout and Intersect’s role - including delivering a keynote on the main stage and launching the new community hub in Japan.

This week’s update spotlights a new Cardano backlog working group. the new Technical Steering Committee space. and an exciting new marketing working group! Plus. we’ve got more on member orientation. Intersect in Tokyo. In February of this year. the Civics Committee chaired a workshop in London.',\n",
       " ' focusing on ideating and mapping high-level design and processes. Initially referred to as the ecosystem process design working group. the group considered how the Cardano backlog and development roadmap could leverage greater distributed development through Intersect’s member-based structure. The working group will support two of Intersect’s core pillars: orchestrating the delivery of the community-approved Cardano Roadmap and facilitating Cardanos continuity for system stability. It will start with what Cardano continuity and backlog could include in 2025. This working group. and potentially a committee change. will contribute and input to the proposed budget for Cardano at the Annual Members Meeting. We’ll continue to update you on this story as it develops. As we move closer to on-chain decision-making (as described in CIP-1694). the TSC will play an integral role. ensuring that the governance of Cardano is based upon sound technical awareness and best practices. The concept of this committee. its members. and how it makes its recommendations via sub-committees such as the Parameter committee are still in progress. a new dedicated section on our ever-expanding knowledge base goes into more detail. It details how the committee will evolve over the coming weeks and months. A recent recurring theme across the ecosystem has been a desire to amplify. coordinate. and expedite our collective marketing power by collaborating on a comprehensive marketing strategy for Cardano. Aiming to capture all verticals and domains across the ecosystem. Intersect member Anastasia Labs. spearheaded by MLaden LM. applied to start the group and will be supported heavily by Intersect’s marketing team. The new Marketing working group will call for members and outside contributors in the coming days to ideate and deliver an actionable and funded marketing strategy via new grants with the potential to utilize treasury funding later this year. a quick note on milestone-based reporting and current projects in-flight:. Milestone based reporting. Milestone-based reporting is a crucial step towards enhancing transparency and accountability. Inspired by Project Catalyst. it provides a clear path for funded projects to deliver on their promises. fostering trust and engagement within the community.

Cardano continuity. the grant projects currently underway. and an update on governance tooling. Welcome to this new section for both new and returning Intersect members. As we work towards achieving our shared objective of developing a self-sustaining ecosystem within Cardano. plays an important role in championing and orchestrating Cardano’s development and governance. We will feature this segment weekly to assist members in navigating this journey. particularly amidst Cardanos rapid growth. Lets start by taking a quick overview of Intersect before delving into essential resources accessible to all members. Intersect is a member-based organization tasked with ensuring the continuity and future development of the Cardano ecosystem. As a community-governed blockchain. this means caring about the technology and processes. enabling technical progress and consensus through discourse and collaboration. Intersect’s pillars. Our committees have been crucial to our mission of ensuring a brighter and more efficient future for the Cardano ecosystem. All committees now have email addresses. which will be announced soon. In addition to the current communications channels. members can email committees directly via these addresses. which the respective committee chair and secretary will manage. The Open Source Committee (OSC) has made major strides recently and published its initial strategy. Cardano’s open-source strategy encapsulates the vision and mission of Cardano’s open-source approach. envisioning a future where a thriving community strongly leads the Cardano project and no single entity dominates its open development. The OSC added:. New Ecosystem Process Design working group. The purpose of the Ecosystem Process Design working group is to support Intersect pillars 3 & 4.',\n",
       " ' Having taken community feedback. the simplest way to explain this working group is to design and govern a backlog for continuity. features. and research initiatives. Keep reading for more information on continuity. with more information about this group available here. One of Intersects core functions is facilitating Cardanos continuity. which is defined as any approved and required technical services needed to build or fix current and future areas of the Cardano blockchain. In Q1 of 2024. we issued continuity contracts to seven Intersect members to continue development and bring exciting new features to our community. Here is the full list of these members and what they are delivering:. The quarterly continuity plan will be published in the coming weeks. providing more information on what is being developed. Look out for more updates in upcoming newsletters. Read more about continuity and how Intersect facilitates the development roadmap here. Community tooling to support the rollout of Cardano’s upcoming new governance features is critical to ensuring inclusive and accessible on-chain decision-making. From products to education. members can apply for various funding opportunities. Among the funding available are the grants currently being offered to Intersect members. The Inclusion and Accessibility category is still open for applications and provides exciting opportunities to support participation in Cardano governance. Please visit here for more information on this grants subcategories and how to apply. The DRep Pioneer Workshop Leaders Programme has now closed. we will update the final number of applicants and the evaluation plan. the Open Grant category closed on Thursday. March 28. Application & review process. Now that the application process has closed. we will be working with a small community pilot group to conduct the first round of evaluations as part of the next stage. The working group of 4-5 individuals will feed any decision for ratification to the Membership and Community Committee (MCC). The winners of the grant proposal will be announced by the end of April. Look out for further information on our social channels and future correspondences. Take a look at all the grant projects currently underway. the Strategy and Architecture team completed their Q2 planning with Intersect members Byron Network and DQuadrant. which are developing the current version of GovTool. The key goal for this quarter is to release the new GovTool features (DRep Directory. Proposal Discussion. and Governance Action Submission) to sanchogov. tools to open GovTool development and operationalize the decentralized overall product development process. Testing for these features was completed last week alongside a new process to provide context for on-chain votes. usability testing for the proposal discussion feature happened this week. and we are now incorporating feedback to continue development. this week marked an exciting development for GeroWallet. a recipient of the Intersect grant. as its creator unveiled the CIP-95/SanchoNet wallet build. making it available for community testing on SanchoNet. With the addition of GeroWallet. the SanchoNet ecosystem now boasts five community wallets. each primed and ready for user engagement. This expansion is a significant step towards enhancing governance participation through the SanchoNet GovTool.',\n",
       " ' Users keen on exploring the functionalities of these wallets and participating in governance activities can find detailed information on wallet statuses and capabilities within the GovTool documentation. Here are this weeks stats for SanchoNet and Govtool:. On this weeks reminders section. Thanks for reading! As you can see. we are constantly working with our members and community to improve the Cardano ecosystem for everyone. We look forward to updating you on our newest developments in future newsletters.Intersect facilitates the continued growth and continuity of a decentralized and inclusive self-sustaining Cardano by providing additional governance processes and structures that enable the Cardano community to advance the protocol together. Cardano has an underlying operational cost for keeping the network running each year. upgrades. and a variety of technical innovations to ensure Cardano continues to be a current and leading blockchain. for 2024. members of Input Output Global and EMURGO funded Cardano’s continuity. This funding enables a collection of members to continue supplying technical services to deliver the core operations. Building Cardano is a decentralized effort. During Q1 of 2024. Intersect issued seven major continuity contracts to seven Intersect members to deliver more than 30 new and innovative functionalities and features for the community alone. we will publish the quarterly continuity plan. which dives deeper into all the work and upgrades currently in development. backlog and budget ideation will emerge to create the first budget for Cardano. which will be presented at the Annual Members Meeting in Tokyo on October 3rd. advancing progress at the intersection of Cardano and its community. Join a rich community of like-minded people to help shape the future of Cardano. Lets build together—join us!. please contact us via email.As Q1 wraps up. Spotlights this week include launching global community hubs starting in LATAM and Japan. upcoming new member area on our website (including announcing membership tiers). the release of new in-depth infographics courtesy of Intersect members Mike Hornan and Summon Platform. Intersect featured in March’s Essential Cardano360. and as usual. we get the latest updates from SanchoNet and Govtool. Cardano is global. and everyone involved should have an equal opportunity to participate and contribute. As such. were excited to announce a pioneering step forward by introducing Intersect community franchise hubs. Intersect community hubs will act as a geographical central point for members to collaborate. meet. and participate. They will enable members to join local events and working groups where all can express their opinions with a regional twist. This is crucial when considering the consensus mechanism that is the foundation of Cardano’s governance system. The first regional hub starts in the LATAM region with Intersect member. and committee member. acting as the LATAM community hub franchise manager. Japan will follow later this spring!. What to expect from community hubs?. To learn more about the process and to enquire about starting your own regional community read more on our knowledge base. We have started to develop Intersect’s members area. The members area will make it easy and straightforward for new and existing members to access their membership and improve onboarding and routes to participation.',\n",
       " ' The members area will also introduce tiers and reasons to join Intersect. All membership levels offer unique benefits. allowing members to fully immerse themselves in the Intersect community and supercharge your Cardano experience as an Intersect member. Our members stand at well over 1.000 and with the introduction of tiers and subscription levels. there’ll be a home for all at Intersect. One of the key benefits that full members will enjoy are voting rights at Intersect’s Annual Members Meeting. including voting on Cardano’s budget for 2025 and more. We will soon open up the members area in beta. starting the feedback loop with the Membership and Community Committee. Following early feedback. we’ll then expand to all interested members for further testing. We’re aiming to release a final version in Q2 2024. and from there. it will continue to iterate and evolve to provide more value to members. Much more on this to come. with demo’s and sneak peeks to be shared throughout April. Development continues with new features for Govtool. Intersect member Byron Networks finished creating the governance action submission feature. which covers information and treasury actions. This development includes the introduction of context (or metadata) for governance actions. weve completed an update to the governance action page. which now displays this context. making it easier for users to cast informed votes. Also this week. the Intersect product team gathered in London to outline the development roadmap for Govtool in Q2 in collaboration with some of the community builders involved in its development. We plan to wrap up the development of the new DRep directory and the delegation and DRep registration processes next week. We’ll share more on these developments and our plans for Q2 shortly. so remember to keep checking our updates here and in our knowledge base. Govtool has seen a spike in activity. with over 40% growth in users testing the latest governance features coming to Cardano through SanchoNet! Check out the stats for the week:.

SanchoNet is about introducing the Cardano community to governance features from CIP-1694 in a controlled testnet environment. SanchoNet reports the first week following the recent reset to install Cardano node 8. SanchoNet successfully navigates a community stress test. Testnets are a valuable and essential component for producing a stable environment for mainnet release. When there are new updates to the testnet. it’s important to understand the throughput limits of the new release. Thanks to Mike Hornan of Able Pool SPO. who arranged and coordinated a community-driven synchronized stress test on SanchoNet. we know the latest SanchoNet release can manage many thousands of governance actions concurrently. Mike called upon the community to spam the SanchoNet network with thousands of governance actions in a coordinated attack to find the limits of the current build. Digital Fortress lead stake pool operator Rick McCracken shared a video of the moment he began spamming the network. The numbers speak for themselves!. We are delighted to report that despite thousands of concurrent governance actions being put through the network. SanchoNet remained online and stable. This is fantastic news for decentralized governance and is another stone firmly placed in the path toward Voltaire. Congratulations to us all and especially to those who took part!. Cardano pioneering entity Emurgo releases a blog post detailing the importance of SanchoNet for the progress of the testnet thus far. highlighting the values of decentralized governance and the process layers that ensure the Cardano mainnet remains completely stable. Read the article here. Our product team is happy to report that Govtool has integrated with the latest SanchoNet node release. The SanchoNet Govtool development team is also working on a platform for reporting Govtool stats that is easier to access and those participating to achieve better data to help further refine governance processes. we’ll continue to report GovTool stats weekly. The GovTool development team is also calling for members to join a governance tool working group to help brainstorm ideas and create recommendations for development.',\n",

Watch this space in the coming weeks. Wrapping up this weeks update. lets stay committed to our vision of a truly self-sufficient Cardano ecosystem! If you’d like to participate in any of the above subjects.It’s been another prolific month for Intersect. Roadmap updates. evolving plans. event announcements. and community tooling awards all fuel the progress in building the foundational structures to support the communitys work in developing and maintaining the ecosystem and core protocol development. The evolution hitherto has been breathtaking. Decentralized governance pushes the boundaries of possibility. representing a radiant beacon for the blockchain industry and showing the world a better way. Let’s take a look at what’s been happening this past month. The 2024 calendar includes historic milestones. key events. and community decision points. The main thrust is the development of minimum viable on-chain governance for Cardano. We’re excited to update our roadmap. increasing 2024s granularity and enabling our members and stakeholders to understand how the next 12 months will play out. Notable additions to the roadmap include:. The Chang upgrade is the culmination of many years of hard work. including all the community participation that continues to build pace on SanchoNet. The upgrade represents a significant step towards minimum viable on-chain governance as defined in CIP-1694. Once stake pools have successfully upgraded their nodes to support the new protocol and DApps and exchanges have integrated the new node. we can upgrade to a new ledger era. we need something new this time. as delegated representatives (DReps) must be onboarded. Following this. Cardano will have moved fully into the age of Voltaire. laying the on- and off-chain foundations for a self-sustaining blockchain and trailblazing the way forward for the industry. The first Annual Members Meeting (AMM) for Intersect will occur in October 2024. and we plan to make it a memorable one. The AMM is Intersect’s duty as a member-based organization. The inaugural event is planned to take place in Japan - a nation with strong and long-standing Cardano community involvement - with the option to participate virtually.',\n",
       " ' Members will have the opportunity to review Intersect’s performance to date and also have the chance to review the Cardano budget that pays for Cardano continuity (see more on continuity below). Members can also participate in workshops and events covering the previous years developments and review Intersect’s 2025 plans for approval. There is much more to come on the AMM. The constitutional convention will take place in Buenos Aires. where the global constitution workshops selected delegates will convene to ratify a final version of the constitution before heading on-chain for confirmation. This collaborative decision-making process aims to not only influence the trajectory of Cardano. but also exemplify the practical execution of decentralized governance by collectively agreeing on the content of Cardano’s constitution. We’ll continue to update the roadmap as events and timings are added or changed. so keep an eye out for updates. ‘Continuity’ was first coined in 2023 to express the technical work required to keep the Cardano blockchain infrastructure running. including upgrades and necessary developments. through our delivery assurance function. we have created a joint plan across seven suppliers. delivering elements of 2024’s continuity. These seven suppliers are delivering multiple products and pieces of development work that will be familiar to the community. as they include the CIP-1694 governance technology. improvements in ledger memory storage. and peer-2-peer network management. Intersect will create the first Cardano product backlog defining these Continuity items and share this with the community for feedback. Continuity work will be defined in the longer term through a community product backlog process and. with community consent. funded by the Cardano treasury with Intersect acting as the coordination body. Work started with an ecosystem process development workshop stewarded by the Intersect civics committee to discuss managing an ongoing Cardano product backlog. We’re working on a deep dive into this important aspect of decentralized governance on Cardano. so watch out for further updates!. Were thrilled to share the phenomenal outcome of the recent ecosystem process development workshop. which was held on February 19-20 at the PCubed offices in London. Thanks to the dedicated participation of Intersect’s Civics Committee members. subject matter experts. representatives from IOG and the Cardano Foundation. and the expert facilitation of PCubed. the workshop proved incredibly productive. we made significant progress in:. The energy and collaborative spirit at the event were truly inspiring. and were confident that the outcomes will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of how we all interact and operate within Intersect. From building an understanding of key ecosystem roles. to defining high-level roadmap goals for the ‘in the trenches’ work of maintaining issues and bugs in code bases. effective processes will drive everything that makes Intersect function as a community-empowering member-based organization. Those participating in the workshop will help shape a clearer path for everyone to get things done in the Cardano ecosystem.

Earlier this month. the OPSO at Intersect published their latest roadmap. building on a major milestone in Cardano’s history - the core codebases migrating from Intersect member IOG to Intersect. Our OSPO manages Cardano’s open-source program and community and ensures that we engage with the open-source community transparently and effectively. The upcoming milestones mark pivotal developments in Intersects trajectory:. Govtool and Cardaminal Transition:. The migration of Cardaminal assumes critical importance in cultivating a deeper partnership between TxPipe and Intersect. This move not only propels the continuous development of the project but also positions it as a crucial supporter of the Cardano Open Source initiative. The alignment of Govtool with Intersects mission behind CIP-1694 and hosting the technology reinforces its commitment to enacting this vision. Open Source Committee (OSC):. In collaboration with other committees at Intersect. this milestone empowers the OSC to formalize and garner consensus on its plan for conducting elections and managing succession. It ensures a seamless transition as the next iteration of voted seats assumes their roles within the OSC. upholding continuity and operational effectiveness. The first draft of the open source strategy:. The initial open-source strategy is significant for both Intersect and the OSC. Through collaboration with the community. they articulate a strategic roadmap aimed at seamlessly integrating Cardano into the open-source landscape. These milestones signify the initiation of Intersects pursuit of its ultimate goal—continuing to advance Cardano as an open and collaborative platform. Read more on the Intersect’s Open Source Program Office. No plan would be valuable without understanding the reason for undertaking the journey in the first place and the core milestones to reach the destination. The Cardano roadmap continues to evolve. and Intersect will continue communicating about any changes and highlighting important and incoming items to our members.',\n",
       " ' Items to watch out for in the coming weeks and months are:. A primary Intersect membership benefit is the ability to apply for grants. These grants are designed around achieving core elements of the Cardano roadmap. Members can view the grants via the Intersect Knowledge Base grants section. In recent updates to the grants. the deadline for the Education & Multimedia category for Cardano Governance has been extended to 5 February 2024. the Open category will remain open throughout Q1 2024. There is no set amount for these awards. as it’d be preferable for applicants to specify the amount needed to implement their proposed solution. allowing for a broader range of creativity. to help applicants sense-check their proposal. the current maximums are 150.000 ADA for the Education category and 200.000 ADA for the Open Category. Multiple proposals will likely be selected for these categories. so smaller proposals are equally beneficial. Proposals outside this range with valid reasoning will also be considered. The grant categories. The SanchoNet GovTool has seen a steady increase in users testing governance features described in CIP-1694. with 194 wallets connected. 88 DReps registered. and 47 delegations with 275 votes recorded in just 25 days. The Voltaire GovTool. of which the SanchoNet GovTool is the testnet version. will enable ada holders to register to become a Delegated Representative (DRep). delegate voting power to DReps. and review and vote on governance actions. The SanchoNet GovTool is open for beta testing now. and its accessible from sanchogov. Key guides:. On the 15th of January and following the holiday period. the Intersect Team met in London for a week of workshops to plan the year. This was the first time the entire team met in person. and progress was made on the following:. The workshops covered the Intersect and Cardano roadmap for 2024 (Membership. CIP1694. GovTools. Chang Hard Fork. Education. Values. and more). Introductions - This was the first time meeting IRL for many. In one of our sessions. we expanded on the values that are important to us as a team and also to how we support the membership to drive the future of Cardano. Trust. respect. teamwork. and decentralization emerged. The team at Intersect comes from a broad range of backgrounds. with many of us having previous experience working on Cardano. Many members already know some of us from events and other contributions. but later in Q1. we’ll update the website to provide more transparency to the people behind the scenes. After a week of planning. the Intersect team is excited to progress decentralized governance and Cardano member agency. Seeing our membership grow to more than 1.300 members this month is fantastic! We are focused on delivering and maintaining decentralized governance on Cardano and always want to hear from our members about their experiences and what they would like to see as member benefits. Here at the editorial end of the Intersect team. we would especially like to understand what cadence of newsletter would suit our membership most.',\n",

In less than six months since we launched. we’ve put forward our purpose. goals. and objectives and installed the foundations to propel us into 2024. In this year-end wrap-up update. we’ll look at the Intersect roadmap and some of the primary happenings of 2023 and reaffirm the core principles that led to the formation of Intersect. Following its launch. Intersect called for members to join and advance Cardano’s core technology and build out the initial committees and working groups. A community-led blockchain needs to consider both the technology side and the way decisions are made by embedding robust processes that enable consensus via discourse and collaboration. Intersect is one of the core foundations of the age of Voltaire’ (the final era of Cardano’s roadmap. named after the French enlightenment thinker). Intersect primarily focuses on Cardano’s ongoing future development and is an aggregation point for community governance. The organization set off down the road of facilitating. the continuity and development of Cardano. With the community at the center of Cardano’s progress. SanchoNet brings ada holders and community building together through an array of governance actions and new capabilities designed to optimize Cardano for community on-chain governance. It’s a dedicated testing environment that introduces the technical features described in CIP-1694. The community is encouraged to take on specific roles. such as test ada holder. stake pool operator (SPO). and delegate representative (DRep). to test and improve on-chain governance mechanisms. SanchoNet is the gateway to an efficient community governance framework. It’s a safe and secure testing environment that exemplifies the basis of decentralized governance by championing community building and democratic consensus. The community is strongly encouraged to participate in SanchoNet and contribute to Cardano’s developmental trajectory. Learn more about getting involved at http://sancho. SanchoNet GovTool. The SanchoNet GovTool allows ada holders to experience some of the governance features described in CIP-1694 and to test governance features in SanchoNet in a guided and straightforward experience. GovTool beta was released in November and has seen around 250 unique visits and around 150 wallets connected at the time of writing. Lace SanchoNet. In other related and recent news. Lace Sanchonet launched. and it is now possible to use a testnet version of Lace wallet to connect to the SanchoNet GovTool and participate in Cardano governance features from CIP1694 in a controlled testnet environment. In 2023. Intersect introduced its first committees and working groups. there are five active committees: Civics. Technical. Parameter. and Open Source. These committees also work with many working groups that help to inform decisions. More committees and working groups are planned and expected as the community presents their ideas and works on Cardano’s future budget.',\n",
       " ' Committees are an effective way. from a structural perspective. to ensure that the view of ada holders can be expressed and actioned - empowering the Cardano community to steer all aspects of the blockchains development and future. We’ve produced an interim committee report from the currently established committees. where they each introduce themselves and provide more information about what they’ve been working on and future plans. Download the report. The core repositories have now been passed from Input Output Global (IOG) to Intersect. marking a significant milestone in Cardanos evolution. As the future stewards of Cardano’s ongoing open-source development. this migration provides a new independent home for the core codebases and enables Intersect to support those members who maintain the repositories. Intersect’s Open Source Committee and the Open Source Program Office will oversee and manage all the Cardano repositories as part of the open source strategy. There can be no understating the importance of this move. It is more than a giant leap into the new realm of decentralized governance. With each step. Cardano continues to deliver on its original design. implementation and roadmap. In the autumn. we announced funding opportunities to ideate and develop community tooling to support Cardano’s governance. These grants are a key component of enabling Voltaire to develop the tools to increase participation and access to Cardano’s on-chain governance. We received multiple proposals from members to build a Proposal Discussion Forum. a DRep Campaign Platform. and a portal for the Constitutional Committee. thank you to all those who applied. Two further categories are now open. specifically focussed on education and a more general open category for creative ideas to drive participation and inclusion. All members are encouraged to apply!. For more information about grants. see here: https://www. intersectmbo. org/grants. This year was of preparation and growth. establishing infrastructure. initiating core communication channels. and enabling our community through our Discord or town halls. which occur every third Tuesday of the month and provide an essential touchpoint for our community to find out the latest and interact with other members. The fifth and final town hall occurred on Tuesday. December 12. and welcomed the second public meeting of the Membership and Community Committee. Many of you have also joined office hours and had 1:1 calls with the community team. sharing your feedback and thoughts on how Intersect can evolve. The feedback shared has been vital. and we’ll continue to listen and work together in 2024. Were also excited to announce that Intersect has crossed 900 members. and our Discord community has raced past 365! Members contribute directly via committees. and general suggestions on how Intersect can evolve into 2024. Thank you to all members for getting Intersect to where it is today. Our members page includes those organizations that have joined Intersect as Founding Members. with hundreds more individuals playing an equal role. To explore our members. check here. Intersect attended some of the most significant Cardano events on the calendar: RareEvo. NFTxLV. and the Cardano Summit. These events aim to unite the Cardano ecosystem and build stronger working relationships.',\n",
       " ' which is crucial to realizing the ultimate potential of the Cardano ecosystem. Connecting at face-to-face events strengthens bonds and sparks new relationships. making them vital for Intersect. Many members have presented at the Intersect booth and featured on swag! There is much more to come in 2024. and we’ll update our event roadmap in early 2024. the future of Intersect is what its members want it to be. you will have the opportunity to define the role you play in shaping the ongoing evolution of Cardano and how it supports the development of the protocol. Intersect is here to facilitate the continued development of Cardano towards its participatory governance and self-sustaining future. As a founding member of Intersect. you play a central role in enabling individuals and communities to work collaboratively to shape their destinies and actively start their journey with Intersect. 2023 was a busy year for Cardano. and 2024 will be even more eventful. Let’s look at the core happenings in the year ahead. In early 2024. the consultation period for the Constitution will begin to accelerate. Steered by the Cardano Civics Committee (CCC) at Intersect. the initial consultation period will last 12 months and include many workshops. allowing Cardanos global community to have their voice heard and their input recorded. Towards the end of the year. there will be a Constitutional Convention where delegates from the community workshops will meet and vote to move forward with a final version for ratification by ada holders on-chain. More details coming soon!. With the temperature check via the Cardano Ballot and Summon Platform earlier this month. the Chang upgrade as described in CIP-1694 will continue to move forward. with a fresh poll using community tooling taking place in Q1 2024. With continued community consent. next year the Chang hard fork will be initiated and will conclude the first phase of Cardano’s on-chain governance - marking a significant milestone for Cardanos journey. Implementing CIP-1694 advances minimum viable on-chain governance. bringing on-chain decision-making to Cardano. Post hard fork. on-chain governance will be a reality. and Cardano will enter a bootstrapping/interim phase where decisions to change and update the network are taken on-chain. Ada holders can also start registering DReps and garner delegations from fellow ada holders. Intersect is now the home for all the Cardano core repositories (26 currently). Product backlogs and their prioritization will be in the hands of Intersect members and facilitated by the Open Source Program Office (OSPO) and the Open Source Committee. Product working groups will be established by members and key stakeholders to align on the backlogs and maintenance of the repositories. Aligning to the repositories. Cardano’s continuity is now being orchestrated by Intersect. and later in 2024. a budget committee will be established to consider and recommend Cardano’s budget for 2025. we strive to foster a thriving Cardano community through practical membership benefits. such as:. If youd like to become a member. Thats a wrap for this months and year’s update. We wish you very happy holidays and look forward to seeing you again in the new year!.',\n",
       " 'Time of last update: 18th December 2023. This year has been a year of community building and collaboration to advance Cardano closer to the final developmental phase in the initial roadmap — Voltaire. Designed as the infrastructure for the Cardano community to collaborate around. Intersect continues to serve as the scaffolding for distributed community building. As 2023 comes to a close. let’s review the communitys impact on Cardano’s progress this year. Since the release of CIP-1694. the Cardano community has been providing implicit consent through active participation in multiple global workshops and direct engagement on GitHub. CIP-1694 has witnessed unparalleled activity and engagement levels. making it the most vibrant and participatory Cardano improvement process in Cardano’s history. community members weighed in on the future of on-chain decision-making on Cardano through a non-binding Cardano Ballot event. enabling the community to share feedback on Cardanos on-chain governance journey formally. Intersect member Summon Association provided a second poll compatible with hardware wallets in collaboration with DripDropz. Both ballots posed the question:. “Based on the current progress. should we as a Cardano community continue to develop and deploy minimum viable on-chain governance as described in CIP-1694. subject to the final approval of the SPOs?”. The Cardano Ballot result on CIP-1694 reveals a positive endorsement for Cardano’s governance journey and toward the CIP-1694 minimum viable on-chain governance approach. This signal comes from a statistically significant sample size of active wallet holders. fueling Cardano’s ongoing development and bringing the next stage in bringing Cardano’s fully participatory governance system to reality. To view the results directly. check out Cardano Ballot and Summon Platform. The Cardano Ballot results were also verified by Intersect member Xerberus. and if you participated in the Cardano Ballot. you can audit your own vote using their verification tool. In analyzing the results. IOG research fellow Philip Lazos. an expert in statistical analysis. added that with any opinion poll. inferring the truth from statistical evidence relies on two components: that the poll was large enough to support the claim and that the selected sample was truly random. Given the overwhelming majority of ‘Yes’ (measured both by count and stake). the result can be interpreted as a positive indicator for adopting CIP-1694. if it is true that voters who are against were less likely to abstain. especially if they have a lot of stake. Otherwise. it is inconclusive. Minimizing this bias cannot be done with only one poll. and the model of the voter base (i. base rates for different voter types. correlations between weights. activity and preferences. etc) will be updated as more community polls are conducted and compared against the real election results. An upcoming blog post will further elaborate on future polls and polling methodology. For further information on understanding the statistical analysis of polls. Wikipedia offers good pages on Opinion polling and Confidence intervals for reference. Enhancing Cardano has always relied on active community input and consent.000 members from 24 countries participated in 50 global CIP-1694 workshops this year to explore the potential of decentralized.',\n",
       " ' on-chain governance. The community’s latest endorsement represents just one of many touchpoints that answer many months of consensus building towards a common vision and a shared appetite to achieve more incredible things together. Further than voting. during the Cardano ballot event. the community had an opportunity to provide feedback via an anonymous form. Some of the more notable comments include:. To capture overall themes from your feedback. we’ve prepared a word cloud based on the feedback:. Maintaining Cardano’s momentum will require the community’s collective focus and participation during moments such as the next temperature check on Cardano’s governance progress early next year. Driving CIP-1694’s implementation is a priority for Cardano in 2024. which will involve a range of opportunities for the community to get involved. From the Constitution global community workshop series and more. these key moments in 2024 will all ladder up to the Constitutional Convention late next year. where community-elected delegates will congregate and work together on passing a final version of the Cardano Constitution to be ratified on-chain by the Cardano community. In line with the CIP-1694 workshops. the SanchoNet rollout this past summer provided ada holders with a safe and secure environment to test and provide feedback on CIP-1694 features and specifications. This initiative unlocked a gateway to new levels of community governance. empowering community members with the freedom and resources to experiment with Cardano’s future. This moment also introduced incentives for developers of governance tools. and DApps and inspired more productive community engagement on GitHub. Good governance is complex but achievable with the support of an entire community. We hope this years progress will inspire the community to continue collaborating and participating in charting Cardano’s path forward in 2024. advancing progress at the intersection of Cardano and Its community. Help shape the future of Cardano by joining a rich community of like-minded people. Lets build together - Join Us!. Thanks to Intersect member IOG. and Research Fellow Philip Lazos for his contribution and support of this process.As a permissionless and decentralized blockchain. and individual agency are central to Cardano’s mission and community-centric future. These principles support open-source practices and values. which have greatly contributed to Cardano’s ongoing development for years and will keep driving Cardano forward as the protocol advances. Vital to Cardano’s open-source maturity and overall growth is the maintenance of the core code repos by the community. for the community. To help enable this. the stewardship of core Cardano repositories is being passed from Input Output Global (IOG) to Intersect – the member-based organization tasked with maintaining Cardano’s infrastructure and sustaining its expansion. this repo migration will provide a new independent home for the core code base and enable Intersect to support those members who maintain the repositories. Since its establishment. IOG and a dozen other organizations have contributed to the code in the repos. reflecting Cardano’s commitment to community building and open-source innovation from the get-go. IOG launched an open-source workstream last October to oversee repository migrations as a means to empower the community with full access and control over foundational Cardano codebase.',\n",
       " ' Intersect has conducted thorough research and preparations. resulting in a comprehensive migration plan that entails the below key target areas:. The migration of Cardano’s codebases will leverage the existing support from IOG. Intersect’s Open Source Committee. and other current maintainers and teams behind the repositories until service agreements are agreed next year. The repository migration is scheduled for December 16. with the goal of transferring all 25 repositories with minimal impact on ongoing developer activity and initiatives. Intersect’s Open Source Committee and the Open Source Program Office will oversee and manage all repository list needs and the successful migration of all repositories to Intersect as part of the Open Source Strategy. Member of the Open Source Committee and Technical Architect at IOG. Michael Peyton Jones said;. Pat Sheridan. Chair of the Open Source Committee and CEO of Modus Create adds:. This milestone marks new developmental capabilities that will propel Cardano into the future. As the network advances in the age of Voltaire. the community will continue to take on ever-greater ownership over all aspects of the protocol. which has been the goal for Cardano from the start. The OSC has recently released a survey for members of Intersect and the wider Cardano community to provide feedback and thoughts on Cardano’s open source approach. Contribute here.

SanchoNet serves as a controlled testbed for ada holders to experience firsthand and provide feedback on the on-chain. technical specifications of Cardano Improvement Protocol (CIP) 1694. such as test-ada holder. SanchoNet is being rolled out in phases to give the community enough time and freedom to experiment with and offer feedback on all of the CIP-1694 features and tools necessary to fostering Cardano’s future governance framework. Consensus Building Through Phases. Good governance is complex. There is a lot of ideation. experimentation. and refinement that’s required in building an inclusive. Instrumental to Cardano’s growth is the careful consideration of all of Cardano’s developmental components. each of SanchoNet’s six phases are deliberate and designed to give testers access and control over Cardano’s entry into the next era of governance. Initially using a Command Line Interface (CLI) for actions. early engagement with SanchoNet requires a high level of technical competence. SanchoNet is currently in Phase 5. In later stages of the testnet program. the implementation of more user-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUI) will broaden out the participation opportunity to a wider. non-technical audience and ultimately. every ada holder:. this update will introduce extended key support. which improves the user experience for those utilizing Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key generation. It will also prioritize improving queries to ledger and governance states. empowering users to programmatically retrieve essential data from the blockchain. It’s a safe and secure testing environment that exemplifies the basis of CIP-1694 by championing community building and democratic consensus. Only with community involvement can we identify and address any issues and learning gaps – crucial to ushering in the next era of governance on Cardano.

Through unbiased processing of immutable data. we. the participants of the Cardano Community. consisting of individuals. contributors and others. choose to follow in the footsteps of the early Internet and cryptocurrency pioneers. who first forged bonds of community through digital technologies. We are guided by our shared principles and tenets as we exercise our self-governance by balancing decentralized decision-making with accountability and safeguarding the security of the Cardano Blockchain. Recognizing the need for a more robust and dynamic governance framework. that neither relies nor depends upon traditional nation-state governance systems. but instead relies on self-governance by the Cardano Community. utilizing. wherever possible and beneficial. blockchain technology in the governance process. we hereby establish this Cardano Constitution to govern the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem. ensure the continuity of the Cardano Blockchain.',\n",

The Cardano Community may propose one aggregate budget or multiple budgets for the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem. Such budgets are expected to cover not less than a period of 73 epochs (approximately one calendar year) but nothing shall prevent the Cardano Community from proposing budgets for shorter or longer time periods. All owners of ada are expected to periodically approve one or more Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budgets through an on-chain Info action. As provided in Section 3 of this Article IV. withdrawals may be made from the Cardano Blockchain treasury as necessary from time to time to give effect to the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budget or budgets then in effect. Existing budgets may be amended following the same process as provided in this Section 1. Development of Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budgets and the administration of such budgets shall utilize. Cardano Blockchain budgets shall specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals including designating one or more administrators who shall be responsible for such oversight. Withdrawals from the Cardano Blockchain treasury that would cause the Cardano Blockchain treasury balance to violate the then applicable net change limit shall not be permitted. No withdrawals from the Cardano Blockchain treasury shall be permitted unless such withdrawals have been authorized and are being made pursuant to a budget for the Cardano Blockchain that is then in effect as required by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix. and which has not been determined by the Constitutional Committee to be unconstitutional. Any governance action requesting ada from the Cardano Blockchain treasury shall require an allocation of ada as a part of such funding request to cover the cost of periodic independent audits and the implementation of oversight metrics as to the use of such ada.',\n",

Any ada received from a Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawal. so long as such ada is being held directly or indirectly by an administrator prior to further disbursement. must be kept in one or more separate accounts that can be audited by the Cardano Community. and such accounts shall not be delegated to an SPO but must be delegated to the predefined auto abstain voting option. In order to participate in governance actions. owners of ada may register as DReps and directly vote on such governance actions or may delegate their voting rights to other registered DReps who shall vote on their behalf. Any owner of ada shall have the option to register as a DRep. Owners of ada shall be allowed to delegate their voting stake to one or more registered DReps. including themselves. DReps may be individuals or coordinated groups. may authorize. or may withhold authorization for. such third-parties to delegate the voting rights of the ada owner to registered DReps on the owners behalf. DReps are entitled to cast votes directly for on-chain governance actions and represent those ada owners delegating their voting rights to them. DRep voting thresholds are set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix. This voting system shall enshrine a liquid democracy model where owners of ada can seamlessly select among DReps. and withdraw or change their delegation at any time. DReps who are representing delegators are expected to periodically adopt. and update as they deem appropriate. codes of conduct governing their activities as DReps and make such codes of conduct publicly available. DReps are encouraged to include ethical guidelines in their codes of conduct. maintenance and ongoing administration of tools to enable owners of ada to explore and evaluate DRep candidates. access and evaluate DRep codes of conduct and select DReps on such criteria as they deem relevant. DReps who are representing delegators may be compensated for their efforts. DReps shall ensure that any compensation received in connection with their activities as a DRep is disclosed. DReps shall not pay compensation to an ada owner or to an owners designee in exchange for being appointed a DRep by such ada owner or by its designee or for voting on behalf of such ada owner or its designee.

SPOs are encouraged to include ethical guidelines in their codes of conduct. Owners of ada who are both SPOs and acting as DReps shall publicly disclose that they are participating in on-chain governance actions in both such capacities prior to exercising any on-chain governance rights. A Constitutional Committee shall be established as the branch of Cardanos on-chain governance process that ensures governance actions to be enacted on-chain are consistent with this Constitution. The Constitutional Committee shall comprise a set of owners of ada that is collectively responsible for ensuring that on-chain governance actions prior to enactment on-chain. are constitutional. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4 of this Article VII. the Constitutional Committee shall be limited to voting on the constitutionality of governance actions to be enacted on-chain. Constitutional Committee members are expected to have appropriate expertise to carry out their required responsibilities. considering their past contributions and involvement in the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.

If the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix sets forth an amendment threshold for a Guardrail that is different than the amendment threshold contained in Section 2 of this Article VIII. then the threshold set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix for such Guardrail shall apply. Introduction. To implement Cardano Blockchain on-chain governance. it is necessary to establish sensible Guardrails that will enable the Cardano Blockchain to continue to operate in a secure and sustainable way. This Appendix sets forth Guardrails that must be applied to Cardano Blockchain on-chain governance actions. including changes to the protocol parameters and limits on treasury withdrawals. These Guardrails cover both essential. intrinsic limits on settings. and recommendations that are based on experience. measurement and governance objectives. These Guardrails are designed to avoid unexpected problems with the operation of the Cardano Blockchain. They are intended to guide the choice of sensible parameter settings and avoid potential problems with security. functionality or long-term sustainability. As described below. some of these Guardrails are automatable and will be enforced via an on-chain Guardrails Script or built-in ledger rules. These Guardrails apply only to the Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 mainnet environment. They are not intended to apply to test environments or to other blockchains that use Cardano Blockchain software. Not all parameters for the Cardano Blockchain can be considered independently. Some parameters interact with other settings in an intrinsic way. Where known. these interactions are addressed in this Appendix. While the Guardrails in this Appendix presently reflect the current state of technical insight. this Appendix should be treated as a living document.',\n",
       " ' Implementation improvements. new simulations or performance evaluation results for the Cardano Blockchain may allow some of the restrictions contained in these Guardrails to be relaxed (or. in some circumstances. require them to be tightened) in due course. Additional Guardrails may also be needed where. new protocol parameters are introduced. Amending. Adding or Deprecating Guardrails. The Guardrails set forth in this Appendix may be amended from time to time pursuant to an on-chain governance action that satisfies the applicable voting threshold as set forth in this Appendix. Any such amendment to any Guardrails shall require and be deemed to be an amendment to the Constitution itself. including any new Guardrails. Each Guardrail has a unique label. If the text of a Guardrail is amended. the existing Guardrail will be deprecated and a new label will be used in this Appendix. if a Guardrail is completely deprecated. its label will never be reused in the future. In all cases. the Guardrails that apply to a governance action will be those in force at the time that the governance action is submitted on chain. regardless of any later amendments. Terminology and Guidance. Should/Should not. Where this Appendix says that a value should not be set below or above some value. this means that the Guardrail is a recommendation or guideline. and the specific value could be open to discussion or alteration by a suitably expert group recognized by the Cardano Community in light of experience with the Cardano Blockchain governance system or the operation of the Cardano Blockchain. Must/Must not. Where this Appendix says that a value must or must not be set below or above some value. this means that the Guardrail is a requirement that will be enforced by Cardano Blockchain ledger rules. types or other built-in mechanisms where possible. and that if not followed could cause a protocol failure. security breach or other undesirable outcome. Benchmarking. Benchmarking refers to careful system level performance evaluation that is designed to show a priori that. 95% of blocks will be diffused across a global network of Cardano Blockchain nodes within the required 5s time interval in all cases. This may require construction of specific test workflows and execution on a large test network of Cardano Blockchain nodes. simulating a global Cardano Blockchain network. Performance analysis. Performance analysis refers to projecting theoretical performance. empirical benchmarking or simulation results to predict actual system behavior. performance results obtained from tests in a controlled test environment (such as a collection of data centers with known networking properties) may be extrapolated to inform likely performance behavior in a real Cardano Blockchain network environment. Simulation. Simulation refers to synthetic execution that is designed to inform performance/functionality decisions in a repeatable way. the IOSim Cardano Blockchain module allows the operation of the networking stack to be simulated in a controlled and repeatable way. allowing issues to be detected before code deployment. Performance Monitoring. Performance monitoring involves measuring the actual behavior of the Cardano Blockchain network. by using timing probes to evaluate round-trip times.',\n",
       " ' or test blocks to assess overall network health. It complements benchmarking and performance analysis by providing information about actual system behavior that cannot be obtained using simulated workloads or theoretical analysis. Reverting Changes. Where performance monitoring shows that actual network behavior following a change is inconsistent with the performance requirements for the Cardano Blockchain. then the change must be reverted to its previous state if that is possible. if the block size is increased from 100KB to 120KB and 95% of blocks are no longer diffused within 5s. then a change must be made to revert the block size to 100KB. If this is not possible. then one or more alternative changes must be made that will ensure that the performance requirements are met. Severity Levels. Issues that affect the Cardano Blockchain network are classified by severity level. where:. Severity 1 is a critical incident or issue with very high impact to the security. functionality or long-term sustainability of the Cardano Blockchain network. Severity 2 is a major incident or issue with significant impact to the security. Severity 3 is a minor incident or issue with low impact to the security. Future Performance Requirements. Planned development such as new mechanisms for out of memory storage may impact block diffusion or other times. When changing parameters. it is necessary to consider these future performance requirements as well as the current operation of the Cardano Blockchain. Until development is complete. the requirements will be conservative but may then be relaxed to account for actual timing behavior. Automated Checking (Guardrails Script). A script hash is associated with the Constitution hash when a New Constitution or Guardrails Script governance action is enacted. It acts as an additional safeguard to the ledger rules and.Last updated 2 months ago. Following the conclusion of Day 1. see the latest working version.

Cardanos governance structure is made up of three areas of interest:. On-chain decision making (best described in the specification. CIP-1694). A Cardano Constitution. Institutions (such as the member-based organization. Each area delivers complementary features to the others and are intertwined to drive better outcomes both on and off chain. Cardano Improvement Proposal-1694 (CIP-1694) describes a governance system to bring decision making for the Cardano network on-chain. The three roles played by stakeholders are:. Delegate Representatives (DReps). Constitutional Committee (CC). a combination of the three roles above will vote to either accept or reject a proposal. In Q2 2024. the Interim Cardano Constitution was published for community review and included in the genesis files when the community approved Chang Update #1. but rather a set of essential rules that were designed to ensure Cardano maintained stability during the interim period that Cardano’s governance would go through during 2024. the Interim Constitution is still in effect and is being interpreted by the Interim Constitutional Committee who votes on the constitutionality of governance actions (as described in CIP-1694). Later in Q2 of 2024. the drafting process began with the aim to move towards a final version ratified later in the year. The draft served as the primary input to global community workshops throughout 2024. the Draft Constitution built upon the essential guardrails described in the Interim into a more holistic set of principles and rules. A total of 63 workshops were held with more than 1400 contributors. The final version of the draft was voted on by elected delegates from every workshop during the Constitutional Convention held in Buenos Aires and Nairobi in December 2024 with a resounding 95% votes in favor. Following the Constitutional Convention. the delegate-approved Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution was submitted as an Update Constitution governance action that was approved by DReps and the Interim Constitutional Committee for its ratification and thereby replacing the Interim Constitution. signalling Cardano fully entering the age of Voltaire. Institutions create the spaces and structures for the ecosystem to ideate. deliberate and recommend changes to the Cardano network. They can be informal collectives and alliances such as the many working groups formed by the community since Cardano launched. to newer larger organizations such as Intersect. In the example of Intersect. it will not only develop into a rallying point for community discussion. but will also work towards maintaining Cardano’s open source repositories and product backlogs. Institutions support the feedback loop to ultimately drive better outcomes on-chain for the wider benefit of the Cardano ecosystem. With these three overarching governance features. the ecosystem now has the foundations of a governance system that can be observed and refined over time by the ecosystem itself. The Cardano constitution is designed to be the founding document that brings together the community’s wishes and discussions and puts them into text as a set of rules and principles to abide by to maintain the sustainability of the Cardano network.',\n",
       " ' It outlines all the governance mechanisms. and responsibilities of all the various governance stakeholders in the Cardano ecosystem such as delegate representatives (DReps). The Cardano constitution is the cornerstone that will guide and serve as an anchor to all the other processes and developments Cardano will need to provide a sustainable technological platform for Web3 products and services. Intersect is responsible for facilitating the overall Cardano Governance which also includes creation of the Cardano constitution. in its interim. draft. and final states. Intersect facilitates and supports the Constitutional Committee and at the moment Intersect (via its members) is one of the interim Constitutional Committee members. You can also read the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution on our Github pages. It acts as an additional safeguard to the ledger rules and types. filtering non-compliant governance actions. The Guardrails Script only affects two types of governance actions:. Parameter Update actions. Treasury Withdrawal actions. The Guardrails Script is executed when either of these types of governance action is submitted on-chain. This avoids scenarios where. an erroneous script could prevent the Cardano Blockchain from ever enacting a Hard Fork action. resulting in deadlock. There are three different situations that apply to Guardrail Script usage. Symbol and Explanation. (y) The Guardrail Script can be used to enforce the Guardrail. (x) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail. (~ - reason) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail for the reason given. but future ledger changes could enable this. Guardrails may overlap: in this case. the . Constitutional Delegates were elected to represent their Constitutional Workshop and work to approve a Cardano Constitution to be put on-chain for DReps and the CC to vote. Although different file formats have been used along the way for drafting purposes. the version of the Constitution that must go on-chain is a text file (. txt) and a hash of that text file. Hashing is used to confirm if a file matches the one being referenced. The hash of a file is like a fingerprint. and is unique to each file. If a single character changes in the file. the hash no longer matches. A text file is used to ensure the hash matches as long as all of the written characters match. Text files strip away all except the written characters in the file. ensuring the hash will match so long as none of the words are changed in the file. Other programs. like Google Docs and Word. will add invisible information in the file. The hash of “Hello World” in a Google Document would not match the hash of “Hello World” in a Word document. the Constitution text being voted on is being shared as a. txt file with the associated hash. This allows you to confirm that the document up for vote matches. word for word. the one that’s been distributed to you ahead of time.

As a community member. your ada stake also gives you the right to participate in on-chain voting. ada holders can:. Delegate their voting power to DReps. Become a DRep (to represent themselves or others). Submit on-chain governance actions. Review on-chain governance actions. Last updated 11 months ago. Cardano’s Voltaire - Glossary: key terms explained. Delegated Representatives (DReps) are a new role introduced in the Age of Voltaire as part of the governance model proposed under CIP-1694. stake pool operators. and the Constitutional Committee are responsible for voting on governance actions. Any ada holder can register as a DRep. DReps will play a crucial role in the decision-making process within the Cardano ecosystem. contributing to the democratic nature of the governance model. Ada holders may delegate their ada voting power to representatives they feel best equipped (for example.',\n",
       " ' through deeper technological expertise) to best represent their interests. Click here to return to the glossary index. Last updated 1 year ago. A person or organization that takes responsibility for setting up and keeping the pool running. This usually entails owning or renting a server. holding the key to the pool. and maintaining and monitoring the node. SPOs can:. Submit governance actions. Review and submit votes on active governance actions. The Constitutional Committee (CC) is one of the three groups responsible for ratifying governance actions under CIP-1694 alongside SPOs and DReps. CIP-1694 defines the CC as a committee representing a set of individuals or entities collectively responsible for ensuring that the Constitutions principles are upheld and enforced. CC members may vote on any governance action and decide if it goes against the Constitution. The CC cannot modify governance actions once presented for a vote. The CC will be initially instituted for the first interaction with members of the Cardano community and evolve as the governance model advances. Like the interim Constitution. there is an interim Constitutional Committee (ICC) to enable the first stage of the Chang upgrade. The ICC focuses on the technicality and base constitutionality of the very first community-submitted on-chain governance actions. Through the technical aptitude and expertise required to interpret the interim constitution and to submit CC votes. the ICC fulfills an important role in maintaining the Cardano blockchain’s stability and security during the interim period. Held in checks and balances through the governance design described in CIP-1694. the ICC is bound by the thresholds and safeguards put upon it. and has a limited scope while the final constitution continues to be drafted through its consultation period. The ICC initially comprises seven members. all on a 73-epoch (one-year) term from the date of the Chang upgrade. As a result of the technical focus relating to the interim Constitution. the ICC is composed of the pioneer entities: Input Output Global. the Cardano Foundation and EMURGO. To ensure broad community representation and diversity on the ICC. Intersect holds the fourth seat. The three remaining seats were elected from the Cardano community. The iCC strives to conduct itself within a set of guiding principles:. Uphold the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution (Constitution) - the primary and most fundamental principle of the ICC is to uphold the Constitution. The Constitution provides the framework and guardrails for collective decision making. The ICC. above all else. must fulfil its role to ensure constitutionality of submitted governance actions. Must be an ada holder - to ensure the ICC member is a member of the Cardano community. as well as to enable participation in on-chain voting. every ICC member must be an ada holder. Transparent deliberation - Cardano’s on-chain governance model. provides a foundation of open and transparent governance processes. and its individual members. will consider how it deliberates and makes decisions with transparency in mind. Regular communication - the ICC is expected to meet regularly to review and evaluate the constitutionality of each governance action.',\n",
       " ' confer on technical guidance and analysis and. with Intersect’s administrative support. take minutes to be published publicly. Publish rationale - when accepting or rejecting a proposal. the ICC may publish in writing a rationale for decisions made. justifying the reasons why a particular governance action is or is not constitutional. Stay informed - the ICC (and the individual members) should stay abreast of important issues impacting on the network. ICC members are not remunerated; however support via an administrative function at Intersect helps to cover such expenses as for administration. communications. technical and legal support. education and training. The ICC election saw 455. and confirm the remaining three seats on Cardano’s interim Constitutional Committee:. Cardano Atlantic Council. Eastern Cardano Council.

The following information relates to the Interim Constitutional Committee elections that were held in 2024 and are being kept for archival purposes. *Voting is now closed. The registration period will be open from May 28th - June 10th (see registration link below). An ada stake snapshot will be taken on June 8th. Voting will be open from June 13th - 23rd using the Summon platform. Results will be announced on June 26th. Both applications to the interim CC and voting will be open to anyone from the Cardano community. Registered candidates will be required to answer a short set of questions as well as provide DRep ID from SanchoNet to confirm basic technical competency. Voting will be stake-weighted based on ada stake at snapshot taken at the boundary of epoch 490 on 8 June. Ranked choice voting will allow voters to choose their top three candidates plus three alternates. Results will be presented back to the Civics Committee to verify the outcome. Technical proficiency in and knowledge of Cardano’s network. economy. and governance parameters (as detailed in the upcoming interim Constitution guardrails). Supporting the above. familiarity with Cardanos governance system including the inter-dependencies and relationships between actors (DReps and SPOs for example). Proficiency in using Cardano node. command line interface and other related tools. A commitment to following best practice and meeting the highest security standards in handling cryptographic keys within the Cardano ecosystem. such as using the X. 509 certificate standard. including key generation. and rotation best practices. Previous experience in a decision-making role within a blockchain or decentralized governance setting (such as a DAO). Degree(s) and/or relevant professional experience in Law. Political Science.

Continue to test governance features on SanchoNet. Register to become a DRep. Delegate to a DRep. Governance tools can be defined as the set of tools that help create and maintain policies. protocols. and procedures within a given framework. The Voltaire GovTool is the first of these. an initial toolset created through Intersect by its members from the Cardano Community. Its current implementation supports DRep registration. vote delegation. and DRep voting. Voltaire GovTool - The initial toolset created through Intersect by its members from the Cardano Community. Watch this brief overview. Overview of the Constitutional Committee Portal. The Constitutional Committee Portal (CC Portal) is part of the core governance tools. supporting the key steps of the Cardano governance process. The CC Portal is a community tool that have been developed via an Intersect grant. The CC Portal. together with the other core tools such as the Voltaire Govtool. and it is developed and maintained by the Bloxico team. The CC Portal provides access to a user-friendly version of the Cardano Constitution (as of now the Interim one). provides the Constitutional Committee members an easy interface to create the metadata to attach as rationale to the votes they submit on-chain. and provides context about Constitutional Committee members votes to Cardano community. The governance described in CIP-1694 does describe some key on-chain steps. Around those key steps there are off-chain processes that support the on-chain steps. Here is a list of defined and suggested steps and processes related to the Cardano Governance proposed in CIP-1694. Off-chain proposal submission and discussion is a governance process that should happen off-chain. before a governance action gets submitted on-chain for voting. During this step proposers should socialise context about their proposal (what later on might get submitted as an On-Chain Governance Action).',\n",
       " ' to explain the rationale behind their proposal. provide supporting evidence of its validity and usefulness. generally provide extra context and more. Once socialize the Cardano Community is expected to review this content to provide comment and feedback that will allow the proposer to improve and adjust the proposal itself and also get a feeling about community sentiment around it. before it gets submitted as an On-Chain Governance Action. Off-Chain proposal submission is a critical step of the overall Governance process. It does allow proposers to provide clear and complete context. as well as supportive material. about their future Governance Actions. and so it allows the overall community to participate in the refinement of the proposal. making use of its shared brain. one of the great strength of a distributed community to handle a decentralised governance process. Off-Chain proposals also generate the valuable context that will then been submitted On-Chain with the Governance Action in the form of metadata. This will then be available On-Chain (and displayed in Governance Tools) for voters to make an inform decision when submitting their vote. as described also in CIP-1694. a structured Off-Chain process can reduce and filter the amount of Governance Actions that get submitted On-Chain. reducing the stress to the blockchain itself. Its important so to consider that without a structured and complete Off-Chain proposal submission and discussion process the Governance Process itself could fail because there would be no clear avenue for discussing and refining ideas. Governance Actions submitted On-Chain would simply be  a basic view of a single or small group people. without any structured context for voters to make a decision on. The suggested key steps for this Off-Chain process are:. Proposal submission in a dedicated platform owned and maintained by the community. Community discussion on the submitted proposal (potentially with a defined minimum length). One or more ways for proposers to gauge the sentiment of the community around their proposal before On-Chain Submission as a Governance Action (for example using submitted community comments. reactions or via an Off-Chain poll). Proposal editing. meaning the ability for proposers to adjust their proposal based on the feedback received by the community. To support this critical step of the Governance Process Intersect has issued a grant to build a Proposal Discussion Forum. More information about this grant can be found. On-Chain Governance Action submission is the process of submitting one of the 7 Governance Actions On-Chain for the voting bodies (DReps. Constitutional Committee) to vote on. Governance Actions can be submitted On-Chain through the Cardano CLI and in the future through a simple user interface in GovTool. Before submitting a Governance Action on chain it will be recommended to have a period of Off-Chain socialisation. On-chain Governance Action Submission. Depending on the Governance Action type different content needs to be provided in the request (link to cip). Optional metadata can be added to enrich the context around the Governance Action. To submit a governance action to the Cardano CLi please follow this guide on Sancho.',\n",
       " ' network https://sancho. network/tutorials/actions. Soon new tools will be available to simplify this process. On-Chain DRep registration is the process that allows ADA holders to register themselves as Delegated Representatives. giving them the ability to represent themselves or others when voting on active On-Chain Governance Actions. This step also allows ADA Holders that register as DReps to add optional Metadata to the registration. The suggested use for this is to add extra context useful for other ADA holders to make a decision about delegation. On-Chain DRep registration can be  performed through the Cardano CLI and through the Voltaire GovTool. To support this critical step of the Governance Process. Intersect has issued a grant to build a DRep Campaign Platform. On-Chain DRep delegation is the process that allows ADA Holders to delegate their own voting power to existing Delegated Representatives (DReps) allow them to vote on their behalf on active Governance Actions. In order to delegate to the right DRep it will be likely that ADA Holder will need to have visibility about the Metadata that DReps have submitted during registration (the extra supportive context). This extra context might include their expertise. interests. past voting history and more. On-Chain DRep delegation can be  performed through the Cardano CLI and through the Voltaire GovTool. To support this critical step of the Governance Process Intersect has issued a grant to build a DRep Campaign Platform. On-Chain Voting is the process that allows the 3 voting bodies (DReps. Constitutional Committee) to submit their decision about On-Chain active Governance Actions. and so allows the Cardano Community and its ADA Holders to be represented in the Governance of Cardano. In order for a Governance Action to get ratified through On-Chain voting it needs to meet voting thresholds from some or all of the voting bodies (depending on the Governance Action Type). ✓ Can Vote on that Governance Action Type. ✕ Cannot Vote on that Governance Action Type. A Governance Action gets approved (or ratified) if it reaches the defined thresholds. A Governance Action gets implemented (or enacted) after it has been ratified through on-chain voting. Note: Enactment for Info actions is a null action. Governance Action outcomes should be socialised in an Off-Chain process after they get ratified or expire. This should be true for all Governance Actions. regardless of their outcome. and even more for those important Governance Actions that get ratified and will be enacted. The Governance process is a linear one. which start with Off-Chain community discussion and should end with the outcome. It is so important to close that loop by sharing the outcome of the On-Chain vote Off-Chain. preferably where the process started (so where the original Off-Chain Proposal was submitted). To support this critical step of the Governance Process Intersect will issue a grant to build a new part of Govtool. More information about this grant will be shared when the grant opens. This grant category closed on 5th April 2024. DReps are a vital part of Cardano’s governance design - voting on governance actions on behalf of other ADA holders who have delegated their voting power.',\n",
       " ' participation and inclusion are critical characteristics for a healthy system. Through Intersect. a new DRep Pioneer Program grant has be opened up specifically looking for applications from capable member organizations to deliver a unified DRep Pioneer course to the Cardano community as Pioneer Workshop Leaders. This is for anyone in the Community looking to be part of the DRep Pioneer Program - as workshop leaders. By the end of the program. a significant part of the community will be armed with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively participate in Cardano’s governance. More importantly. the Pioneer Program paves the way for future leaders in Cardano - equipping the community with knowledge and tools to govern our global financial and social infrastructure into the future. Intersect is providing a fixed incentive range from 20.000 to 25.000 ADAs to join a small group of other Workshop Leaders to co-design and deliver a unified curriculum and continuous learning program to their respective community and region. Creating the first cohort of Cardano DReps who can effectively perform their role in Cardano’s governance design. SanchoNet is a vibrant. and community-driven platform that stands apart from other testnets. Following a phased delivery roadmap. SanchoNet will expand to include a range of governance features. including submitting governance actions. while providing a valuable educational resource for users who want to learn more about Cardanos governance system. Every community member is invited to join SanchoNet and actively contribute to shaping Cardanos governance future. Get started by visiting https://sancho. A Governance Action is a proposal that gets submitted On-Chain for voting. It is an on-chain event triggered by a transaction. Governance actions have an expiration period. after which the action cannot be enacted. Any ada holder can submit a governance action for a vote on-chain. Once the action is recorded on the ledger. voters submit voting transactions. In CIP-1694 describes 7 types of Governance Actions:. GA - Motion of no-confidence. GA - New constitutional committee or Quorum size. GA - Updates to Constitution. GA - Hard-Fork Initiation. GA - Protocol Parameter Changes. GA - Treasury Withdrawals. GA - Info. Note: a motion of no-confidence is an extreme measure that enables Ada holders to revoke the power that has been granted to the current constitutional committee. A modification to the off-chain Constitution. recorded as an on-chain hash of the text document. While different kinds of governance actions have different requirements. ratification always involves two of the three governance bodies (DReps. and SPOs). except for a hard-fork initiation. an action will  be ratified when a combination of the following occurs:. the Constitutional Committee (CC) approves of the action (the number of Yes votes meets the CC’s threshold). the DReps approve of the action (the stake controlled by the DReps who vote Yes meets a certain threshold of the total active voting stake). the SPOs approve of the action (the stake controlled by the SPOs who vote Yes meets a certain threshold over the total registered voting stake). The ratification period is the time that elapses between a governance action being submitted and its ratification.',\n",
       " ' Enactment refers to a Governance Action. A Governance Action gets implemented (or enacted) after it has been ratified through On-Chain Voting. Threshold refers to a Governance Action. A threshold is the minimum amount of voting stake (from each of the voting bodies) that a Governance Action should reach to be ratified. Each Governance Action Type might have specific thresholds to meet. In the CIP-1694 Governance Metadata refers to any Off-Chain extra data submitted On-Chain to provide extra context. DRep Metadata:. These are optionally submitted during DRep registration and should allow DRep to provide more context about themselves. Governance Actions Metadata:. These are optionally submitted during Governance Action submission and allow proposers to provide extra context about their Governance Action to the voters to allow them to make an informed decision. Vote Metadata:. These are optionally submitted when any of the voting bodies (DReps. Constitutional Committee Members) submit their vote to provide extra context about their decision. For Constitutionally Committee Members is mandatory to submit a rationale about their vote and so to submit metadata with their vote. Note: When submitted On-Chain. Metadata will be made of a URL where a. JSONLD file is stored and a Hash of that URL. (More info can be found here in CIP-1694). Currently the structure of these metadata is in progress of being defined by the community in CIP-100?. to be enabled by a hard fork combinator event in 2024. will apply the technical capabilities of CIP-1694’s on-chain governance onto the mainnet. The upgrade is named in honor of Phil Chang. Phil was an early leader in Cardano governance. and his thinking contributed significantly to the early design of Voltaire. He understood that governance brings out the best and worst of the human condition and always approached his work with the reverence and mindfulness that it demanded and deserved. CIP-30 proposes a  specification allowing web pages and DApps to interface with Cardano wallets. This CIP defines how web pages and DApps access the injected Java Script code and the API for DApps to communicate with the users wallet. CIP-95 is a proposal designed to empower ada holders with a voice through voting capabilities. using a standards-based approach to maximize wallet implementations and enfranchisement. During a tooling hackathon in Edinburgh. participants achieved a consensus around prior Open-question decisions. ratifying the proposal’s base design. CIP-1694 introduces a new on-chain governance model for Cardano. This CIP seeks to advance the current governance system. ensuring every ada holder has a voice in Cardano’s governance. The proposal outlines a tricameral model consisting of stake pool operators (SPOs). and a Constitutional Committee (CC). each with distinct responsibilities and roles. The CIP-1694 proposal was merged into the main branch of the CIP GitHub repository on June 30. marking its transition to the “Proposed” status. A constitution is a collection of rules for a state that determines the fundamental principles by which a state is governed. Throughout history. constitutions have played a key role in establishing and delineating a Government’s structural framework.',\n",
       " ' defining the main institutions of the state and their respective powers. and limitations. A constitution provides the framework for decision-making and typically incorporates design features that should reduce decision-making costs at scale. As Cardano is a community-led ecosystem. it is imperative that its Constitution is enacted for the benefit and protection of the entire ecosystem. The Cardano Constitution will provide the framework and guardrails for collective decision-making. It will also define the rights and principles for those participating in the Cardano ecosystem and provide the foundation to meet the current and future demands of a maturing ecosystem (see also Interim Constitution). Ada holders must ratify the Constitution. an act of solidarity to protect and ensure the health of the Cardano ecosystem.

This release includes essential fixes and has been stress-tested to confirm stability. so we’re confident it’s ready for a full mainnet launch. potentially this week. For the hard fork. we need two key governance actions:. Plutus Cost Model Update – Necessary adjustments to prepare the network. Hard Fork Metadata – A detailed description of the upgrade’s goals and impact. ensuring transparency. This draft has been shared internally for review and will be finalized soon. We’re aiming to submit this proposal to the mainnet by early November. with a goal of having at least 85% of stake pools upgraded to support a smooth transition. Boosting participation from delegated representatives (DReps) is a priority. as it strengthens community representation in Cardano’s governance. Our goal is to double current participation to match levels seen in Catalyst. and we’re rolling out communications to help make this happen. This includes regular blog updates. and Twitter spaces for direct engagement. Discussions have been held around minimum participation thresholds to ensure the upgrade’s security. and we’re working to establish a safe baseline for DRep involvement. Although no exact percentage is required. we aim to have strong representation to support smooth decision-making. Once the mainnet launch date is confirmed. we’ll host a Q&A to address community questions. Our knowledge base is also regularly updated with resources. meeting summaries. and recorded sessions to keep everyone informed. https://cardanoupgrades. org/chang-upgrade-2/chang-upgrade-2-overview. Info Action - Should K Increased:. This proposal aims to increase community participation in Cardanos governance by encouraging discussion and understanding of protocol parameters. specifically the K parameter and its effect on stake pool saturation and rewards. It does not suggest any specific changes at this time.',\n",

Chang Upgrade #2 overview. Intersect Civics Committee. This page is written on behalf of the Hard Fork working group. the information contained is subject to change and amendment by the working group at any time. To view details on Cardano Upgrades facilitated by Intersect Hard Fork working group visit the details space below. The term hard fork describes a radical change in the blockchain: a change from one protocol to another. In most blockchains. a hard fork indicates block changes or a change to their interpretation. Cardano initiates hard forks in a unique way. instead of implementing radical changes. through a hard fork combinator event. there is a smooth transition to a new protocol while saving the history of the previous blocks. Intersects role is to coordinate this activity on behalf of the community. This requires collaboration between Intersect members. users of Cardano. and suppliers and builders across the ecosystem. Once a capable. updated node is available there are a series of required activities to test and promote into use and mainstream adoption. via a hard fork. These activities will be coordinated by the Hard Fork working group. which in turn reports into the Technical Steering Committee at Intersect. To learn more about hard forks please read the Cardano Docs article. Further information. and an overview of the last major hard fork. Vasil. can also be found on here Cardano Docs and previous state-of-play updates. Further details and attestations of community readiness for major upgrades such as hard forks can be found in our dedicated  space. View details on Chang and Plomin upgrades in the dedicated space. This moment represents a significant step towards minimum viable on-chain governance as defined in CIP-1694. Cardano will have moved into the Voltaire Era. The first of two upgrades (Chang Upgrade #1) will deploy a set of governance features to Cardano and enter the technical bootstrapping phase as described in CIP-1694. The second upgrade (the Plomin upgrade. previously Chang Upgrade #2) moves CIP-1694 out of technical bootstrapping phase and unlocks the full features of CIP-1694 on-chain governance including full DRep participation and all types of governance action. Phil was a pioneer in Cardano governance at IOG. establishing decentralized decision-making foundations by implementing CIP-1694 on-chain governance mechanisms. Originally the “Second Chang Hard Fork” (Chang 2). renaming to the Plomin Hard Fork. representing every individual who stands ready to pick up the torch and carry the ecosystem forward. Matthew was a much loved and respected member of the Cardano community. He passed unexpectedly on November 14th. The Chang upgrade will follow a similar path to that of the Vasil upgrade. The final decision to hard fork will be made – in consultation with members of the SPO.',\n",
       " ' DApp and community – against 3 key criteria:. No critical issues outstanding on node (including ledger. consensus. Benchmarking and performance-cost analysis is acceptable. Community (including exchanges and DApp projects) has been properly informed and has had sufficient time to prepare for the hard fork combinator event. The Plomin upgrade utilises bootstrap on-chain governance mechanisms to vote. ratify and enact major changes to the Cardano blockchain. These as being described in the Voltaire era and CIP-1694 documentation. It is the first major event to use such on-chain governance. Although likely the upgrade will require the similar criteria as the above Chang upgrade the decision on what this is. and if it has been met is now in the hands of community governance actors. in this case stake pool operators and constitutional committee members. To find details on these please continue reading into the Plomin upgrade overview in the following section of the knowledge base. Please note that this overview is indicative of the process. some details have been omitted for simplicity and brevity. The process is also adaptable and subject to change. Also note that the process will change in the near future to reflect on-chain governance actions. The following information is intended to provide the community an indicative overview of the major release process. major releases include such events as hard forks. In blockchain technology a hard fork is one of the most significant upgrades. It is a radical change in a blockchain protocol that affects the validity of blocks and transactions on the decentralized network. The below provides an outline of the role different roles that Intersect committees. working groups and the community play in contributing to the major release process. Continuity suppliers play a crucial role in preparing for the upcoming hard fork by building a node thats ready for release. Ledger - updates the system that keeps track of all transactions. making sure its ready to handle the new types of transactions that the hard fork may introduce. Node - improves the core software of the blockchain to support enhanced features and performance. Consensus -  the rules for how transactions are verified across the network. ensuring everyone agrees on what is valid. CLI (Command Line Interface) - makes it easier for developers to interact with the blockchain by enhancing the tools they use to deploy and manage their applications. these and other updates from the continuity suppliers ensure the new node is robust. and reliable for release. setting a solid foundation for a major release such as a hard fork. Intersect coordinates major releases. such as a hard fork. through its community led Technical Steering Committee and associated working groups. Technical Steering Committee - ensures that governance of Cardano is based upon sound technical awareness and best practices. The committee is a rally point for key members. suppliers and third parties to coordinate delivery of development services to support the Cardano blockchain. Intersect Hard Fork working group - the hard fork working group focuses on the details of the hard fork.',\n",
       " ' They are made up of relevant experts in different technical areas to facilitate the coordination on behalf of the TSC. Continuity suppliers play a key role in making sure that new updates and changes to our software are of the highest quality before they go live. Development - push via quality - the process starts in the development phase. where the main focus is on integrating quality right from the beginning. Instead of adding it later. quality is a priority from the start. which helps in building a more reliable and robust product. Quality Reports -  once the development integrates quality measures. the next step involves detailed quality reports. These reports are generated to assess the performance and reliability of the new updates. When preparing for major updates such as hard forks. community feedback and preparation is essential. Key members are invited to working groups. all of the community is encouraged to provide feedback. SPOs (Stake Pool Operators) - play a crucial role in maintaining the blockchain network. Testing with SPOs helps ensure that the new updates will work smoothly in the live network environment. It checks the stability and efficiency of the network from the perspective of those who operate the network nodes. Wallets - are tested to ensure that they can safely and effectively manage and store the new types of transactions that might be introduced by the update. This testing helps prevent issues that could affect users funds. Exchanges - need to integrate seamlessly with any new blockchain features to allow for smooth trading and liquidity. Testing with exchanges ensures that they can handle transactions without any disruptions or security risks. DApps (Decentralized Applications) - Since dApps operate directly on the blockchain. testing with dApps checks for compatibility issues and ensures that they continue to operate efficiently even after the updates are applied. Feedback and issues are iteratively collected. triaged. categorised and resolved by the appropriate continuity suppliers. Collecting Feedback - continuity suppliers actively gather feedback from users. and the community. This feedback is essential as it provides insights into quality and what needs improvement. Major Issues - using the feedback collected. continuity suppliers work to resolve all major issues that could disrupt the service or product performance. These could include technical issues. performance inefficiencies. or community deployment problems. Resolving Issues - once major issues are identified. the suppliers work on resolving them promptly. They prioritize these issues based on their impact and complexity. Once satisfactory time has passed. allowing major exchanges. SPOs and DApps to contribute to the quality process outlined and no high severity issues remain. a hard fork combinator event can be initiated - pull of the community via adoption. A hard fork combinator event is a way to update a blockchain without splitting it into two separate paths. Unlike a regular hard fork. which usually creates a new branch of the blockchain and leaves the old one behind. a hard fork combinator blends multiple updates into one smooth process. This means the blockchain can introduce new features or rules without stopping the system or losing any of its history.',\n",
       " ' How this works?. when the Cardano blockchain moved from the Byron system to the Shelley system in 2020. they used a hard fork combinator. This tool allowed them to keep all the old Byron information while starting to add new Shelley features. This gradual change helped everyone on the network move over to the new system smoothly. without having to switch all at once. We hope you find the above a useful. as an indicative summary of how the major release process works. and the part the community has to play in the process. To read more about. and to contribute to. quality and feedback please go to the following article on our knowledge base: https://docs. org/cardano-upgrades/quality-and-feedback. Quality is a consistent benchmark with all upgrades no matter how big or small. To ensure we release and maintain secure and stable nodes and upgrades. we encourage the community to help with testing and providing feedback. This is especially important in the lead up to a major event. like a protocol version change (or hard fork). We always actively encourage issues or bugs to be raised by our members. and the community more broadly towards those teams who are supporting the continuity of Cardano. To raise a ticket. simply log an appropriate ticket on GitHub under the cardano-node repository at the following link:. com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/issues/new/choose. A number of options are available. and select what you believe a best fit. All tickets will be triaged by a member of the joint technical teams and assigned a severity. Soon we hope to provide analytics. to track a wealth of health information associated with the repositories. As well as history and volume trending of issues and bugs. by a number of measures. Cardano is a blockchain network and associated infrastructure that provides social and financial interactions to network participants. The blockchain technology gives us the foundation to build an economy with a shared medium of exchange (ADA). For Cardano to thrive. we need to grow the economy that sits on the technology. One shared goal of the Cardano community is to drive the growth of Cardano. This can be achieved by evaluating future development based on contribution towards this economy. Cardano economic growth derives from three main variables:. Competition (driven by increasing utility); more businesses competing for resources. Risk Management; insurance or other forms that encourage investment. Regulation; provides confidence to end users to trade in the economy. (Note: Risk & Regulation were part of the original Cardano White Paper). Each goal outlined below will improve one or more of the three main economic variables described above. Technical goals that underpin the economy:. Participation; growing global participation drives transaction growth. Collective governance; decentralization means ada holders and network participants control & manage the economy. Performance; speed. memory and throughput all contribute to transaction growth. Interoperability; widening the economy to join with other economies increases transaction growth. Transparency & audit-ability; builds confidence to trade in the economy. The technical characteristics of blockchain that enable the economy:. Security; consistent need to main security for participants.',\n",
       " ' Accessibility; need ease of access to drive participant growth. Availability; need consistent reliability to build confidence to use the network. Last updated 8 months ago. A treasury system is a community controlled and decentralized collaborative decision-making mechanism for sustainable funding of the underlying blockchain development and maintenance. The Cardano treasury system was outlined in the initial Cardano White Paper and latterly in the monetary policy. which can be found in the Cardano Docs repository. back in 2019. a research paper was published exploring the concept and mechanics in much more detail. Maintaining. developing. and improving a blockchain project requires ongoing monetary support. The treasury was outlined to perform this function and provide funding for new features. improvements. and other adoption/utility/innovation initiatives which will be allocated through a community-approved decentralized process (aka on-chain voting as described in CIP-1694). Cardanos treasury is funded through two methods {source}:. Monetary expansion from the Cardano reserves - the Cardano reserve is a fixed amount of ADA put aside when blockchain created which is gradually being burnt down to expand the treasury. Blockchain fees to process transactions - the proportion of the treasury funded from blockchain fees rather than from Cardano reserves will increase over time. There is also the unspent treasury carried forward from the previous period. The temporal units in Cardano are Epochs. Which means the treasury gets topped up every Epoch by expansion from the reserves and fees. {Source CEX explorer}; Every 5 days. 3% is taken from the reserve together with collected fees and both are used for the epoch reward. From this amount. 20% is taken and put into the treasury. Thats roughly 5. 5M ADA every epoch. As the reserve declines. so do the contributions to the treasury. It is expected that in the future the income from the reserve will be gradually replaced by the income from fees. and subsequently network growth. This method has been outlined. in more detail at the previous Catalyst Town Hall Presentation on April 20th 2022. The reserves are a fixed amount of ADA that is expanded into the Treasury and will gradually burn down. The increased ADA available in the Treasury is then circulated into the market. allowing for more transactions. As the Cardano economy develops. the proportion of the treasury funded from blockchain fees rather than from Cardano reserves will increase. Last updated 25 days ago. This snapshot provides an overview of the DReps ecosystem within the Cardano governance framework. as of February 3. Influence Power represents the proportion of total active voting power held by a DRep. It is calculated by dividing the DReps total active voting power by the total ADA delegated to all DReps. This page provides an introduction to Intersect annual member meetings. These meetings typically serve several purposes:. Review of the past year. Election of board members.

Intersect is a member-based organization (MBO). which means the community is in charge of steering and organizing the future of Cardano’s blockchain. Anyone or any organization in the community can choose to join Intersect. The board currently has five seats. IOG and EMURGO hold two. Wyoming State University holds the education seat; two seats are available for Intersect membership. The committees are teams made up of people from the Cardano community. They steer and provide recommendations on behalf of the community at large. Since Intersect was established in January 2024. the committees have been staffed by initial volunteers. Intersect administration. and seed funding organization resources. They have helped us progress and have helped us achieve a stable position. Thanks to them. we are now at a phase of maturity where we can take the next step and ask the membership community to apply for these seats and elect their committee members to allow us to continue striving forward. To maintain momentum. we will take a phased approach. Some of the committee seats will be elected at one or more annual members meetings (AMM). and a second election will be held on April 25. 2025 to fill the remaining committee seats.

The purpose of Intersect’s Operational Services is to support committee projects by managing the tender. contract processes and overseeing the budget. Our approach ensures compliance. and effective management of resources. enabling committees to focus on their objectives. Below is a diagram showing how the Intersect Operational Services Team has been set up to support the committees with their contracts and budgets. Please read the Procurement Guidance & FAQs for detailed information about the procurement end to end process. principles and expectations of Intersect Operational Services. Intersect Operational Services: Intersect’s Operational Services support committee projects by managing the procurement process and overseeing the budget. and effective resource management. Tenders and proposals are both used in the procurement process but serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:. Tender: A tender is a formal offer to supply goods and/or services in return for payment. The buyer issues a Request for Tender (RFT) that outlines detailed specifications for the work. qualifications. and requirements. Vendors submit responses. which are evaluated against the buyers mandatory criteria. The process is more rigid. and once the tender has closed. the project owner must disqualify non-compliant tenders. Proposal: A proposal is less specific than a tender. The buyer (in our case the Committee) issues a Request for Proposal (RFP) when they have a clear idea of what they want to achieve but rely on the expertise. creativity. and innovation of the vendor to define the scope of work. The proposal identifies the problem or business opportunity. defines the solution. methodology. project plan. pricing. and organizational credentials. Proponents can revise or withdraw proposals at any time without consequence. tenders are more structured and legally binding. while proposals allow for more flexibility and creativity in the response. The choice between the two depends on the projects requirements and the level of detail the buyer has defined. Committee Requirement Document (CRD): Committees will request this document to submit their requirements to Operational Services for work they’d like to propose out to the Community. Request For Proposal (RFP): an RFP is the “call for proposal” from Intersect Operational Services to its members and the broader community. asking them to supply a proposal to the requirement. Request For Information (RFI): An RFI is a formal solicitation from Intersect Operational Services to its members and the broader community seeking expressions of interest or information. Milestone Acceptance Form: The Milestone Acceptance form is a document to confirm that a specific project milestone has been completed and accepted by the Committee and Intersect. It records that the deliverables meet the agreed-upon criteria before proceeding to the next phase. Last updated 3 days ago. Below is a 6 month timeline representing at a high level:.',\n",

Cardano Development Holdings (CDH) operates a pool of funds for use to benefit the Cardano blockchain and the development of the Cardano ecosystem. All project funding will come from the CDH with Intersect appointed to administer the funds on its behalf. Below is a diagram showing how the Committees budgets will be managed:. To ensure transparency. Intersect has proposed a quarterly meeting be held with the CC/DReps. At these meetings. the Committees. supported by Intersect Core Services. would walk the audience through the financial details and value delivered during the period. Blockchain protocols and automated governance are vital. but they sometimes need human intervention. and like all software. it needs maintenance and enhancements to retain its relevance and introduce new features. Intersect will ratify maintenance and enhancement actions through membership participation. the recommendations of elected committees such as the technical steering committee. and community governance actions. These actions will often involve doing some work. whether organizing an event or developing a piece of technology. Once work and work packages have been agreed upon and committees have recommended work to a suitable supplier. delivery assurance is needed. These specialists at Intersect have the knowledge. skills. and experience to manage contracts and projects from award to successful conclusion. Delivery assurance exists to provide assurance that projects will be delivered.',\n",
       " ' By adhering to documented. transparent processes that reflect industry best practices. delivery assurance works to earn and maintain the trust of all stakeholders at minimal cost. The delivery assurance function at Intersect provides committees with processes and expertise in project management. who sit within a broader operational services team who can provide support in commercial. legal. and financial matters. Providing these services to all committees in a common way allows for economies of scale. It’s a service that allows committees to focus on their primary purposes. making steering recommendations on behalf of the membership. without needing to spend time undertaking these delivery tasks. which can be heavily administrative. Intersect’s delivery assurance professionals set expectations. accept deliverables and provide them to the committees for their review and evaluation. disburse payments to suppliers. and deliver extensive reporting to committees. and members. These reports provide committees with the necessary information to make decisions and manage risk regarding the work undertaken. ensuring community transparency. delivery assurance was pivotal in the novation and delivery management of 14 core continuity contracts. The full list of projects is publicly available on the Intersect knowledge base. adapting to serve our communitys needs better. Originally. ensuring projects were managed efficiently and effectively on behalf of the community. serving more of our steering committees. delivery assurance remains focused on ensuring that every project undertaken by our committees is delivered successfully. supporting the continued growth and success of Intersect and the wider ecosystem. Delivery assurance monitors the delivery of contracted updates to Cardano on behalf of the community. Its processes and procedures are building a body of knowledge that will ensure continuing improvement by and on behalf of the entire community. and helping contributors meet their milestones. delivery assurance fills an essential role in the ongoing success of Cardano. Intersect has used best practice from external bodies such as the  Association for Project Management (APM) and the Project Management Institute (PMI). to ensure that we are serving the community in the best possible way. Please find below some examples of where we have utilised best practice.

During 2024. reports on contractual progress were produced monthly and quarterly. summarizing the progress made across core continuity work. You will find all these reports in the following subpages. Since the foundation of Intersect at the start of 2024. the Delivery Assurance team has been coordinating with a multitude of suppliers who are working to develop and maintain core Cardano. Throughout Q1 a number of important milestones have been completed. which are outlined in this summary. Delivery Assurance forms part of Technical Operations team and coordinates continuity delivery partners to ensure the timely and reliable delivery of products. Cardano “continuity” is defined or referred to as any approved technical service needed to build or fix current and future areas of the Cardano blockchain.',\n",
       " ' Continuity in this definition can include new developments. Below is a summary of the Q1 milestones completed by companies within the Continuity workstream:. The Byron team continue to develop the GovTool WebApp by supporting the launch and running a beta testing period to discover and fix bugs and collect feedback and ideas. In Q1 the following milestone was reported complete and described by the Bryron team below:. Explore the new horizon of digital engagement with our latest design suite optimized for every screen:. Experience our homepage and dashboard designs. perfected for every device size from mobile (375px) to desktop (2560px). ensuring a responsive and seamless experience no matter where you are. Innovation Unleashed:. Explore the future with our governance action submission and delegation flow designs. featuring wireframes and experiments that redefine the boundaries of user experience. First milestone in the path of Governance Actions delivery. Galois are leading the development of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for future interoperability of the Cardano economy. “Galois has successfully delivered Milestone 3. implementing ZK circuits that verify Plonk proofs and adding ECC Chip support for multiple curves including Pluto/Eris. These are key building blocks to fully recursive ZK proofs. enabling benefits including zk-rollups and the ability to trade between blockchains. Input Output’s Infrastructure group is developing and testing the Cardano governance node in readiness for CIP-1694 and continuity maintenance. CIP 1694 second fixes - this work included a large number of acceptance criteria including: the addition of bootstrap era support for Cardano node. execution of quality plan. finalizing Plutus v3 (cost model. testing). fixing of issues found interesting. updating of DB Sync & the deployment of all updates into SanchoNet. Governance support - development of a prototype guardrail script as well as a prototype constitutional committee credential management script. Repository migration - assisted with the migration of a second wave of repositories from IOG to Intersect. Network enhancements - developments of both a Genesis Lite & Peer Sharing Solution  as well as various P2P upgrades & enhancements. Tweag are developing the Ouroboros Genesis mechanism (Genesis). which enables new nodes to join the Cardano blockchain and bootstrap themselves without relying on a trusted service. It also allows nodes to become disconnected and rejoin the network similarly. During Q1 they completed phase 3 of this work which consisted of the following Milestones:. “As part of the ongoing effort towards full Cardano decentralisation. the Genesis team has delivered a number of milestones towards the implementation of Ouroboros Genesis. Tweag have now implemented the Genesis State Machine. which concerns the determination whether a node is caught up with the network or still syncing. as well as the limits on eagerness and patience”. Welltyped are developing new Log Structured Merge Tree implementations (LSM). These will store the ledgers UTxO set on disk rather than in memory. substantially increasing the number of UTxOs—supporting many more users—while also allowing nodes to run on cheaper. “An intermediate milestone has been completed for the Cardano LSM on-disk storage component. This milestone covers the development of the core in-memory data structures and algorithms.',\n",
       " ' Progress on this component is progress towards the goal of enabling Cardano to scale to much larger ledger state sizes (e. comparable to Bitcoin’s ~100M UTxOs). enabling higher transaction throughput. while keeping memory (RAM) requirements acceptable. VacLabs are working on ensuring the continued practical use of the Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets for the Cardano community and enhancements to support the Conway era. During Q1 they completed the following milestones:. Completed development of Trezor hardware wallet firmware and supporting libraries to support the Conway ledger era and its governance model as described within CIP-1694. this upgrade allows smooth transition of users to the new era. as well as the ability to participate in governance by delegating to DReps. The code was tested internally. externally and pre-reviewed by Trezor. now just pending final review and release process. “Completed development of Leder hardware wallet firmware app (and supporting libraries) to support the Conway ledger era and its governance model as described within CIP-1694. this upgrade allows smooth transition of users to the new era for all devices. with the smaller memory devices allowing users to participate in governance by delegating to DReps. The larger memory devices (Nano X. Stax). support all actions of DReps and Constitutional Committee members. externally and has been reviewed by an external auditor appointed by Ledger. It is expected that these functionalities will be released by Ledger shortly. “This is a highly technical milestone. to support a tweak in the ledger design. This supports some sets of data within transactions being tagged with the CBOR tag 258. Updating this ensures a smooth transition for users from Babbage to Conway ledger era. It is anticipated that a full report. like the above. will be published at the end of each quarter. as well as smaller updates through our other channels and development updates. The Intersect Delivery Assurance team is one of the supportive. servant-leader. functional teams at Intersect. They support the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) in the operation and oversight of contracts which are in delivery. In Intersect. the delivery assurance team sits within the Technical Operations function. As Intersect formed. a number of continuity contracts were novated and to be managed on behalf of the community. Cardano “continuity” is defined or referred to in the contracts as any approved technical service needed to build or fix current and future areas of the Cardano blockchain. The delivery team was charged with setting up bootstrap and interim processes to facilitate the management of these contacts. as well as being involved in the process of the novations. This retrospective report is intended to give you an update on what the team has achieved during Q1 and what the team has in store for Q2 2024. All continuity suppliers received an ‘Intro to Intersect’ evergreen presentation and a face to face with the team. outlining the changes in the ecosystem. reporting lines and details on proposed new billing and invoicing procedures. All suppliers brought into how Intersect intends to run planning for key continuity contracts.',\n",
       " ' At Intersect we use PI planning and manage delivery in quarters at a time. We have and continue to work with our continuity suppliers to revisit the confidentiality terms which were in their novated contracts. Rightly. some confidentiality may need to exist. but in some cases there is a little too much. This has prevented Intersect from sharing as much as we would have liked. We are continuing with our suppliers to agree new terms. which better reflect this era of Cardano we are all working in. We have set up and tested payment processes and systems so we are able to fulfil our contractual obligations and be able to pay suppliers and grantees. The majority of our continuity suppliers and grantees have been integrated into our payment process and have been tested. ensuring we send the correct payments at the right time. The delivery assurance team has established a bootstrap TSC. Ensuring fundamental processes are in place for suppliers to provide updates. that milestones and acceptance criteria are captured and documented. Which in turn trigger our contractual processes mentioned above. The initial Hard Fork working group has been stood up. containing the continuity suppliers who will ultimately deliver the CIP-1694 and supportive technology. Details of both this committee and working group have been added to Intersect’s knowledge base. Ready for the community to start to take an active role in shaping additional value. information and processes. The team has created a procurement process for the facilitation of contracts. Within the delivery assurance team we have a procurement function. A subset of the team who process. assess risks and facilitate contracts. The team have developed and reviewed the new Intersect Master Service Agreements. Statement of Works and other supporting documents. Developed a risk management process for contract management. The procurement team also supports internal Intersect and business contracts and have processed; people resources. back office tooling (such as Google suite and Hubspot contracts). website development contracts and all the legal documentation required for the migration of the GitHub repositories to Intersect. The delivery assurance team has also had responsibility to create and own the budget and finance process across internal Intersect functional teams and staff. Created a budget management process for functional teams (Technical Operations. Back-Office Operations. Marketing & Communications and Membership & Community) as well as budget management for suppliers. contracts. grants and our own people resources. In a little over three months we have achieved a lot. but we understand that there is still some distance to go and there are always improvements we can make. As a team we have set some goals for the next quarter. below are some of the highlights. Introduce financial tooling to support and industrialize our initial processes. Create a legal playbook - to better facilitate changes in a quicker more controlled way. allowing for more sharing and collaboration from suppliers. Create a change management process. From time to time we will inevitably need to change the contracts we administer. New delivery assurance page and delivery information on our knowledge base.',\n",
       " ' More regular delivery assurance updates and blog posts - we challenge ourselves to produce more regular and informative monthly and quarterly updates. Introduction of members to the TSC to start shaping the future. You can read about the delivery assurance team here. on our Intersect knowledge base. In case you missed it. our last continuity update blog post is here. Byron continues to develop the Voltaire GovTool webApp by supporting the launch and running a beta testing period to discover and fix bugs and collect feedback and ideas. In Q2 they completed the following milestones.

The user stories added to this document are implemented with tests on the actual Govtool repo. These tests can be seen on the reporting dashboard here:. io/govtool-test-reports/govtool-frontend/”. “For workstream 2 Milestone 2. the DQuadrant team refactored the testing infrastructure to be inline with the testing strategy. This involves having all cypress tests migrated to Playwright tests and replacing Cypress test dashboard with Allure dashboard. The deployed test dashboard is made available here:. io/govtool-test-reports/govtool-frontend/. The tests are triggered on commits made to the test branch. This happens after the deployment of the test branch on the test infrastructure. After the deployment. the tests on frontend and the backend are triggered. The dashboard shows the test results of all executions of the tests which represent the user stories defined on workstream 2. milestone 1. This milestone enables the team to see the regression of the tests with each new commit pushed to the repository and helps to detect and debug the bugs early. “For workstream 3 Delivery 1. DQuadrant team refactored the existing tests related to DRep registration and added new tests for user stories. These tests are added to the test suites that get executed and reported when there is an update on the test branch. This keeps the status of the test report up-to-date. There are failing tests that indicate the bugs for which the team has created appropriate Github tickets and assigned the dev team. The deployed test dashboard is made available here: https://intersectmbo. The user stories for which tests were added under this milestone delivery are tracked here: https://github. com/IntersectMBO/govtool/issues/999. This milestone enables the team to see the regression of the tests with each new commit pushed to the repository related to DRep explorer user stories and helps to detect and debug the bugs early. “For workstream 3 Delivery 2. the DQuadrant team refactored the existing tests related to Governance action and added new tests for 8 new user stories. com/IntersectMBO/govtool/issues/1000.

Galois is leading the development of Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for future interoperability of the Cardano economy. “Galois has successfully delivered Milestone 4. implementing KZG accumulation and ZK circuits that verify IPA accumulation.',\n",
       " ' As part of this IOI has been working on CIP 1694 Second Fixes (including bug fixed. DB Sync Updates. and deployment to SanchNet). Governance Guardrail Support. Network Enhancements. and researching capacity improvement opportunities. In Q2. they delivered Sanchonet 8. and 8. 12 bringing the ability to use Plutus V3 in Conway-era transactions and containing the latest governance changes for SanchoNet. These releases include essential changes and fixes that are needed for the Chang hard fork and provide an implementation of CIP-69 for Plutus v3 (only). Tweag is developing the Ouroboros Genesis mechanism (Genesis). Earlier this year Tweag completed Limit on Patience. Genesis State Machine & Lightweight Checkpointing. “We worked on the Intersect MBO Business Project. which has a fixed project goal: To conduct an initial assessment and provide advisory services to Intersect in order to develop the foundational vision and strategy of the Open Source Program Office(OSPO). The Cardano ecosystem needs to transition smoothly following the Voltaire 1694 Cardano Improvement Proposal. which details changing from the old organizational approach to a new. Member-Based Organization. The transition was already planned when our team members joined the OSO (Open Source Office) department. We evaluated. advertised. and assisted Intersect MBO OSO in elaborating on Vision and Strategy Development. Stakeholder Communication and Management. Open-Source Office implementation. and OSO organizational structuring. Our work included specific research and development activities to deliver new. adapted deliverables covering open-source industry standards. the open-source community. and the Intersect MBO organizational entities. “We created a new documented base for the transition and continuity of the Cardano processes and projects. preparing the implementation of the Voltaire 1694 CIP and clarifying the mission. vision. and objectives. We integrated the governance model and structure. the delivery assurance reporting areas. and the GitHub repositories reporting mechanisms into existing reporting tools. We participated daily in all deliverables and actions required by the OSO Head. “The GDD Governor is the last major component of the Genesis functionality. It is responsible for disconnecting from peers offering chains which. in the best case. are sparser than the worst chains offered by other peers. This allows syncing to progress past the limit on eagerness since we now disconnect from peers that may have been holding us back. Welltyped is developing new Log Structured Merge Tree implementations (LSM). As part of this work. an interim milestone focussed on Core Data Structures & Algorithms was achieved. enabling higher transaction throughput while keeping memory (RAM) requirements acceptable. “Well-Typed is developing an on-disk storage component intended to be used in Cardano to help Cardano scale to much larger numbers of accounts and UTxO sizes while preserving good system performance. We have recently completed an intermediate technical milestone covering several key I/O code paths within the component. Benchmarks of these code paths indicate that we are on track to meet the overall performance targets for the component. Meeting these component performance targets will be important in the broader project that aims to enable Cardano to scale to much larger ledger states while preserving good overall system performance.',\n",

       " ' A total of 38 tests were written for covering the user stories covering the cases for use cases like wallet connected/disconnected states. proposal submission. proposal validation. listing. searching. accessing. filtering. searching etc. These tests confirm the systems ability of GovTool to enable users to successfully submit a draft proposal for discussion and later submit as governance action. This milestone validates the GovTool’s proposal submission and discussion forum’s capabilities. By validating the proposal submission and discussion mechanisms under different conditions. we ensure that the GovTool can correctly handle governance actions. This contributes to the overall effort to make decentralized governance possible for the Cardano community. Milestone 1 focuses on maintaining and hosting the governance actions loader used for loading governance actions in bulk. For Milestone 1. we had been maintaining and hosting the governance actions loader since the beginning. It had been operational until early July. At the moment. it is not fully operational because of the dependency bug https://github. com/IntersectMBO/cardano-api/issues/594  Issue is created and fix is being prepared by the cardano-api. Once the bug is fixed on the dependency. the loader can be made operational again. The Governance Actions Loader is useful in loading multiple governance actions in bulk which helps in (stress) testing the GovTool. The loader internally handles the constraints of linking the correct previous governance actions and preparing valid governance actions to submit on chain. This contributes to the overall testing effort to make decentralized governance possible for the Cardano community. “The overall purpose of our project is to test the Cardano node readiness for the Chang hard fork. Milestone 1 focuses on testing Plutus v3 new builtins. regression tests. wallets (hardware/software) and performance measurements. This milestone is important in the broader development of Cardano as it ensures that the Plutus v3 and the migration to v3 is smooth. we prepared the tests for Plutus v3. inheriting the base framework from Antaeus repository. We also prepared a separate tests dashboard to show all the Plutus v3 tests. Ledger Nano S hardware wallet and several software wallet were also tested with several testing scenarios ranging from normal transactions to governance functions. To support DApps for smooth migration to Plutus v3. we also prepared a comprehensive migration guide. which was widely shared in the communications. During testing. some bugs were found which were promptly reported to the respective development teams. Under the scope of the milestone. we were able to successfully cover the expected tests defined on the scope of work. and are proud of the work done. Milestone 2 focuses on load testing governance actions within the Cardano network. For Milestone 2. we implemented and observed scenarios involving multiple votes on various governance action proposals. Three distinct scenarios were tested: a majority vote leading to the enactment of one proposal. an equal vote leading to the enactment of the first proposal. and insufficient votes leading to no enactment. These tests confirmed the systems ability to accurately process and enact governance decisions based on the voting outcomes. This milestone validates the Cardano networks stability and governance capabilities.',\n",
       " ' By validating the voting and proposal mechanisms under different conditions. we ensure that the network can efficiently handle governance actions. This contributes to improved network security. and the overall reliability of the Cardano communitys decision-making processes. Milestone 3 is centered on testing various scenarios related to DReps. and delegation processes. In Milestone 3. we implemented and validated scenarios involving DReps and vote delegation. The tests included generating DRep IDs. enforcing single delegation. verifying stake registration requirements for delegation. preventing multiple DRep registrations. and testing the retirement process for DReps. Each test confirmed the correct behavior of the networks governance mechanisms. such as ensuring an ADA holder cannot delegate to multiple DReps and that only registered DReps can retire. This milestone contributes significantly to the Cardano network by ensuring the accuracy and security of its governance and delegation processes. By validating these critical functions. we ensure the networks ability to manage decentralized voting and delegation efficiently. thereby improving overall network security. and trust within the Cardano community. Milestone 4 focuses on DApp testing with use-case DApp as Cardano Marketplace. It focuses on the integration of PlutusV3 with existing marketplace decentralized applications (DApps) initially developed using PlutusV2. This milestone is crucial for the broader testing of Cardano. as it ensures that upgrades to the smart contract platform do not disrupt existing applications and that new features are utilized effectively. In Milestone 4. we conducted extensive tests to assess the compatibility and performance of PlutusV3 in the context of marketplace DApps. This included verifying the functionality of buy. and mint operations using updated reference scripts and documenting computational costs and associated fees. Benchmark tests were performed to evaluate the performance improvements of PlutusV3. and compliance with CIP-69 standards was also confirmed. This milestone contributes to the Cardano network by ensuring that the transition to PlutusV3 is smooth and beneficial for DApp developers and users. By validating the integration and performance of new smart contract features. we validate the overall functionality. efficiency. and scalability of the Cardano ecosystem. contributing to a more robust platform for future developments and innovations. Milestone 5 focuses on testing the Cardano networks ability to handle mass delegation to abstain from voting. This milestone is important in the broader development of Cardano as it ensures that the network can manage large-scale voting behaviors and still function smoothly. For Milestone 5. we tested a scenario where a large majority of ADA holders delegated their voting power to abstain. We conducted tests with 1.000 and 10.000 wallets. where 99% of ADA holders chose to abstain. Despite this. the governance action to update the constitutional committee was successfully ratified by the remaining DReps and SPOs. These tests confirmed that the network could handle extensive abstention while still processing governance actions accurately. This milestone validates the Cardano network by proving its capacity to manage large-scale delegation behaviors without compromising functionality. Ensuring that the network can handle mass abstention improves its stability and reliability. contributing to a more secure and efficient governance process for the Cardano community.',\n",
       " ' Milestone 6 focuses on testing the guard rails scripts and the governance actions with a gov-cli utility. This milestone is important in the broader development of Cardano as it ensures that the guard rails are properly enforced. For Milestone 6. we prepared the tests for the guard rails that are merged to cardano-node-tests so that it can be executed at any time. The tests dashboard also now includes the guard rails tests. we prepare a Python utility called ‘gov-cli’ to easily compose and test the governance actions for the community. This utility is publicly accessible on the PyPi repository. we have prepared the documentation for the utility with several recipes to get started. Milestone 7 focuses on monitoring the core repositories: cardano-node. cardano-api and cardano-cli for the user reported Github issues. This milestone is important from the perspective that no critical user reported bug is left un-triaged and the critical bugs are brought to the attention of the respective teams. For Milestone 7. we monitored the new issue reports on the core repositories daily to triage to find out the reproducibility and severity of the bugs. In the process. we ourselves raised several additional bugs as well. During the scoped time. there were several issues reported but no critical labeled issues were found that would impact the Conway era functionalities. EMURGO completed key milestones for the Yoroi Wallet and Cardano Serialization Library. enabling better user interaction in the Conway era and upgrading key functionalities to support CIP-1694. “EMURGO has completed all the development and testing required to upgrade the CSL to support the changes introduced in Cardanos Conway era. including the distributed governance model described within CIP-1694. Further incremental beta releases will also enable user-based testing via the SanchoNet governance test network. “EMURGO has upgraded Yoroi Extension Wallet (Desktop) to support Cardanos Conway era. enabling users a smooth transition to the post-Chang hard fork. This deliverable also includes a beta release via Yoroi Nightly to allow connectivity to the SanchoNet governance test network. and the extension of Yoroi to support the CIP-95 standard. “EMURGO has upgraded Yoroi Mobile Wallet to support Cardanos Conway era. This deliverable includes a beta release. to allow connectivity to the SanchoNet governance test network. IOE engineering teams have supported the final checks and balances required prior to initiating the community-driven Chang hard fork into the Conway era. This includes management and completion of User story testing – results of which can be found here CIP 1694 User Story Testing https://tests. org/test_results/requirements/chang_user_stories_system_tests. html#cip1694-user-stories. Final amendments. peer review and external audit of key scripts for governance guardrails and credentials management required for hard fork. The wider IOE and Input Output Group communication and community teams have also supported community readiness. Contributing to communications. press releases. hosting Question and Answer sessions and during the lead up to hard fork offering. at times. 1-2-1 DApp and developer support. IOE also stood up an incident support team in conjunction with Intersect in the lead up to and over the hard fork boundary.',\n",
       " ' Aside from Chang. the IOE team have been supporting the set up and initial sessions of several Special Interest Groups at Intersect. details for these can be found on the Intersect Discord. These are designed to share technical details. gather feedback and community support on proposals currently being shaped. These proposals will ultimately be put forward to the Product and Budget committee for inclusion in future funding requests. This is aimed to democratize some of the technical information which to date has only resided within the core development teams. “This release contains the latest governance changes for Identity Management to allow ICC key build for Constitution. “This release contains the latest governance changes for SanchoNet. It has support for a new cost model for Plutus v3. plus new Plutus byte string primitives. The Constitution Committee quorum has been renamed to threshold in the CLI and a new economic parameter minFeeRefScriptCostPerByte has been added for reference scripts. WellTyped achieved another key milestone with the Minimal Working Version of the on-disk storage component for UTxOs. This solution will allow for higher UTxO scalability and improved performance. benefiting the broader Cardano ecosystem. “Well-Typed are developing an on-disk storage component intended to be used in Cardano to help Cardano scale to much larger numbers of accounts and UTxO sizes. while preserving good system performance. In previous milestones we have delivered various pieces of internal functionality. In this milestone we have connected that internal functionality to the component’s public API for the first time. In particular we have filled in the part of the public API that covers basic key/value operations: lookup. insert and delete. In addition for this milestone we have created a benchmark that simulates the UTxO workload (using the new public APIs for lookup. insert and delete) and measures the throughput. This benchmark will be used during the project to guide our work to improve performance. and at the end of the project to demonstrate whether the performance targets have been met. “Well-Typed are developing an on-disk data storage component intended to be used in Cardano to help Cardano scale to much larger numbers of accounts and UTxO sizes. In previous milestones we have implemented the component’s public API. covering basic key/value operations like lookups. inserts and deletes. we created a benchmark that simulates the UTxO workload and measures the throughput. In this milestone. we extended the public API to support “monoidal updates”. A monoidal update can be used to update a value (e. increment a number) without requiring a separate operation to look up the value that already exists in the database. This is a more performant alternative to performing a lookup followed by an  insert. we implemented various optimisations to the basic key/value operations. and demonstrated benchmark results showing the project is on track to meet its performance goals.

       " ' votes received). Any feature you can think of that would improve the quality of Cardano governance discussions. Be creative!. Before diving into specifics. here are a few key terms and definitions mentioned in this brief. and related to Cardano’s on-chain governance:. CIP-1694 - a technical document which outlines Cardanos on-chain governance system. Chiefly. it enables Cardano changes to be proposed. voted on. and enacted on-chain. Voltaire GovTool - the initial toolset created through Intersect by its members from the Cardano community. The current implementation supports DRep registration. SanchoNet - the dev network which is running CIP-1694 technology. With on-chain governance introduced by CIP-1694. ada holders will be able to delegate their voting power to Delegate Representatives (DReps). community members representing other ada holders in voting. This concept is the central element of liquid democracy in the age of Voltaire. To support the delegation process and increase informed decision-making when delegating. ada holders need a common space to discover and explore registered DReps. Building on the feedback captured in the community-led CIP-1694 workshops. it’s imperative that ada holders can identify a DRep’s  domain of expertise. their perspectives and interests. how they voted in the past. DReps need a place where they can share their profile and credentials. and campaign for ada holders to delegate their voting power to them. To support this goal. Intersect is opening up a grant opportunity to fund the development of a DRep campaign platform. a tool to enrich the vital role DReps and delegation play in Cardano’s on-chain governance. The proposed solution should provide multimedia educational materials or activities to enhance the learning experience. Examples include:. Tutorials. Interactive educational materials (video and animation). Guidelines. Glossary of terms. Documentation on all the core components related to the age of Voltaire. along with details of their design and architecture. Simulated environments or sandboxes to enable community members to gain hands-on experience and practical knowledge. Interactive workshops. meetups. hackathons. Any other way you can think of that will help to educate. onboard. and engage ada holders as we advance minimum viable on-chain governance. The Constitutional Committee (CC) is one of the three groups responsible for ratifying governance actions under CIP-1694. alongside SPOs and DReps. This committee will be responsible for voting on governance actions to ensure compliance with the Cardano Constitution. The role of the Constitutional Committee is critical in the governance process. and its votes and decisions will be important for ADA holders to understand. Responding to community feedback via the CIP-1694 community workshops. Intersect are looking for proposals to build a new Constitutional Committee Portal. The Constitutional Committee Portal will be a tool for the CC to share their voting record and accompanying rationale as to why a governance action was either constitutional or unconstitutional. The portal will also be a common space to store the Cardano Constitution for all ada-holders to view. This portal will be critical in driving transparency to the CC and its role in Cardano’s governance. Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP). CIP-1694. Governance Action (GA).',\n",

With the minimum viable on-chain governance introduced by CIP-1694. ada holders will be enabled to fully participate in Cardano’s on-chain decision-making. including having the ability to submit Governance Actions (GA). or delegate to one. As we advance both on- and off-chain governance in the age of Voltaire. there need to be openly available online resources for ada holders and the ecosystem to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and components of Cardano governance. Intersect offers grants for members to develop multimedia educational resources to help educate. and engage ada holders to participate in the new governance features made available with CIP-1694. Web content must meet WCAG 3. The content created for this proposal is universally accessible on a public repository by the time the project is completed. If the solution proposed is built on top of existing software. it must meet the same scalability requirements as the original solution. the front page load time must be no more than 2 seconds for users that access the website using an LTE mobile connection. The solution proposed must be open source with an open source license that permits the assets to be changed. Intersect’s Open Source Committee is defining its open-source best practices. the examples below (sourced from Intersect member. IOG) can be referenced:. Cardano Engineering Handbook. Guidance related to open source policy can be referenced here. Guidance related to expected best practices can be referenced here. This grant category closed on 28th March 2024. Following the introduction of on-chain governance by CIP-1694. the community will have new opportunities to engage in Cardano’s governance. the on-chain features are only a small part of the overall journey for the Cardano community to make informed and wise decisions. The “Open” grant category is available for members to propose new tools that have not already been funded through any other categories. are not adequately addressed. or are not built at all. These proposals should aim to create new features and complement other tools being built in the ecosystem. Tools/features that have already been built. or funded to be built (and are therefore excluded from this category) include:. Proposal discussion forum for off-chain proposal discussion and polling before on-chain governance action (GA) submission. GovTool features for registering as a Delegated Representative (DRep). delegating to a DRep (which will include a DRep explorer function). submitting GAs. viewing GAs. and voting on GAs. DRep campaign platform for DReps to build up their profile and provide updates to the ada holders who delegated to them. Constitutional Committee portal to document the constitutional committee’s votes and rationale. and hold a copy of the current Cardano Constitution. A metadata indexer to access and store all governance-related metadata posted online. and then serve that metadata whole. or in part via an API to apps that request it.

       " ' Tools from the community listed on Sancho. Network. In the first half of 2023. the Cardano community hosted workshops across the globe to discuss CIP-1694 and the community tooling needed to support the new features that the CIP brings. Based on the responses gathered. we are providing a prioritized list of what could be addressed in this open category. While this list provides some direction. open-category grant proposals may cover any functionality that would improve the Cardano governance experience. Cardano governance communications. Communication between DReps and delegators. Communication between stake pool operators (SPOs) and delegators. Enable Cardano community sentiment/polling related to governance. A mobile wallet upgraded to CIP-95. Enabling crowdfunding for governance-related deposits. Allow multiple actors to pool funds to meet the deposit amounts required for governance participation. Accommodate changing deposit amounts. Reputation tracking for DReps. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) /KYC/ proof of address control for Cardano governing bodies (DReps. and Constitutional Committee members). Provide on and/or off-chain governance data or regular reporting. Multiple formats are relevant. APIs. long-term storage. processing. exports. and explorers. Historical and current state/live data. Governance analytics related to:. Proposals and governance actions. DReps’ support of proposals and governance actions. Delegated stake to each DRep. Aggregate treasury spend over time. Proposed treasury spend. Define and track DRep reputation. Alongside the tooling listed above. there was high demand for governance tools that work on mobile devices and limited data settings. and also for implementing governance features within wallets. This Grant (phase 1) closed on 19th April 2024. As new processes are created to support Cardano governance and Intersect. one of the most important goals is to encourage participation and engagement. The need for inclusion and accessibility cuts across all processes. communication channels. and interaction points for Cardano governance and Intersect itself. This grant category supports different initiatives to open up and make more accessible Cardano governance and Intersect.

The Intersect team has facilitated the creation of the foundational tools that will support Cardano governance. Over the past 6 months. Intersect members (such as Byron Network. and Bloxico) have worked developing these tools (current implementation can be tested on sanchogov. tools). In the ongoing effort to distribute and decentralize the ownership and maintenance of these tools. we tasked a member of the community to define a DevOps strategy. Based on that we now have clear requirements to award a contract to a member of the community to support the DevOps work for these Governance Tools. Intersect is providing a grant of up to ADA 90.000 to support the work described in the Requirements section until the end of 2024 (≈ 7 months).

       " ' a new on-chain governance system was presented to the community for consideration (see CIP-1694). In the past 18 months. this CIP has become the most actively engaged CIP in Cardano history. This proposal describes a governance system that creates on-chain governance for the Cardano blockchain. And while it lays out the technical specification for on-chain governance. it does not define the necessary off-chain aspects of governance. it does not define a governing document for the social layer managing the blockchain. the Cardano Constitution. The first Cardano Constitution will be the Interim Constitution. This will be in place as part of the interim phase of on-chain governance (learn more here). to enable the Chang Upgrade. The next step in the process of developing  the Cardano Constitution is to host Constitutional Workshops around the world to solicit feedback from members of the Cardano community at large. This feedback will feed into the Constitutional Convention for approval by Constitutional Delegates. Following the Constitutional Convention and successful on-chain ratification of the Cardano Constitution produced at that event. the new Constitution will replace the Interim Constitution. in close collaboration with members and steered by the Cardano Civics Committee. will support and facilitate the consultation period leading up to the on-chain ratification of the final constitution in early 2025. To support the consultation period. the Cardano Civics Committee will contribute by;. Providing input on a new draft Cardano constitution. Defining the process for Constitutional Workshops to select Constitutional Delegates and Alternate Delegates to attend the Cardano Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires in December 2024. The global constitutional workshops are a keystone of the constitutional journey in 2024. To capture a diverse set of perspectives from the Cardano ecosystem. Intersect will support community hosts to facilitate and coordinate workshops around the world in geographically distinct regions. Intersect will provide constitutional workshop hosts who are members with a one-time grant to facilitate hosting a live event experience in their community - ensuring Cardanos final constitution meets the diverse needs of our global community. These workshops should be held in-person with an option for additional virtual attendance (updated on 14th August 2024). and take place between August 1st and October 15th. As Constitutional Workshops are also the means by which the community will select constitutional convention delegates. each constitutional workshop must meet a quorum of participants. To elect any constitutional delegates and alternates. the minimum quorum for a constitutional workshop is 10 voting participants. Prospective workshop hosts will need to demonstrate at least 15 registrants to proceed with hosting a Constitutional Workshop. To ensure a high quality. organized live constitutional workshops. prospective hosts are also encouraged to invite members of their community that represent the following areas of expertise or interest:. Legal and/or constitutional expertise. Technical expertise. including Cardano smart contract developers. Stake Pool Operators. DAOs. DeFi. Dapp builders and more (not exhaustive). Translators.

Interim Constitution - Until a final Cardano Constitution has been developed and ratified by the community - a programme of consultation that will take place during 2024 - a set of interim rules will be required to support the transition. The interim Constitution will define both the on-chain ‘technical’ and the off-chain ‘governance’ guardrails needed to maintain the security and reliability of the blockchain. Without an interim Constitution. the interim Constitutional Committee cannot fulfill its role in ensuring (within a limited scope) the constitutionality and technical soundness of on-chain governance actions. The process to develop an interim Constitution started by defining both technical and governance guardrails within committees of Intersect. As the steering bodies within this organization. committees provide recommendations for the Cardano community. Once finalized. the content of the interim Constitution will be included in the Chang upgrade (see CIP-1694 or our recent article on the milestones and key terms). development is underway for technical guardrails within a smart contract framework.',\n",

There is no set amount for this grant. as we would prefer applicants to specify the amount needed to implement their proposed solution. allowing for a broader range of creativity and ambition. as a steer. we expect the costs to fall between 50.000 - 100.000 ADA. We are recommending that the voting tool described in the Requirements section of this document be put out to tender in an RFP. The RFP will be open for two weeks. This is so that we can find the most suitable provider. whilst allowing enough time for this provider to build the tool that Constitutional Delegates to the Constitutional Convention will use for voting to approve the Cardano Constitution. There will be a Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires. held in order to finalise the Cardano Constitution and then to ratify it with a vote. The people making these decisions will be Constitutional Delegates.  each one representing a region in which a constitutional workshop was held. where they were elected by workshop attendees. There are two purposes of this tool. it is to facilitate a poll to approve the Constitution. In addition we want this to be a celebratory occasion for the Cardano community as a whole and we want the tooling to reflect this. both by being an on-chain voting tool and creating a spectacle. Because of the nature of the constitutional delegates’ work. the organisers of the Convention will need to provide the constitutional delegates with a method of making decisions in a way that would be acceptable to both the constitutional delegates themselves and create legitimacy with the wider community as a whole. Only someone who is a constitutional delegate elected from one of the global constitution workshops is eligible to vote. and they do so on a one-delegate-one vote basis. Any decision taken must be quorate in order to be legitimate. The threshold for approving the Constitution is a number of “yes” votes that is >50%* of the constitutional delegates who have not cast a vote to abstain. This is consistent with how on-chain ratification is calculated. Votes Cast. Scenario. Did not vote. Voted abstain. Voted no. Voted yes. Total number of constitutional delegates.',\n",
       " ' Result. yes. 62. Scenario A Explained. Threshold = (60 - 20)/2 =20. Result= 23>20 = constitution approved. Scenario B Explained. Threshold = (62 - 0)/2 =31. Result= 31==31 = constitution not approved. Because the number of yes votes (31) in scenario B was equal to. but not greater than the threshold (31) the result would be that the constitution would not be approved. Delegates and alternates would be asked to continue negotiating details of the constitution until it was felt a new poll could be held with a reasonable chance of approval. at this point a new poll would be held. *50% is an example of what the threshold might be. however there is a likelihood that the threshold will be set to the level required for DReps to ratify an Update to the Constitution governance action on-chain.

This grant Part 1 is now closed. Govtool and Constitutional Committee Portal frontend are built on top of NextJS stack which has full I18n support since version 10. The i18n routing support is currently meant to complement existing i18n library solutions like react-intl. react-i18next. lingui. rosetta. next-intl. next-translate. next-multilingual. tolgee. inlang and others by streamlining the routes and locale parsing. The internationalization (and translations) work by providing the list of locales. the default locale and domain-specific locales. and the tech stack will automatically handle the routing. The frontend stack itself is already configured as explained above. Now we need the community contributors to work on the translations and internationalization files holding key-value pairs of strings used across the interface. The default en-UK version will be provided. In order to provide the right tooling to community contributors to work on the translations. we need to implement a Translation Management system. Translized. Smartling. Localize or similar OR we can leverage from newer AI tooling. Solutions like Poedit offer online translations tools which can be integrated into our frontends so that users themselves can suggest better translations maintaining the context of written word in different languages. The successful applicant will be required to deploy Poedit. the localisation management system. The successful applicant will integrate Poedit with the Intersect GitHub account to more easily manage the localization of language files hosted on GitHub. the successful applicant will be required to use Automatic Translation feature which will allow us to use machine translation engines from Google.

The Interim Constitution has been in place from hard fork and will remain until the final constitution is ratified. Intentionally minimal and reflects the tenets of CIP-1694. The Cardano Constitution will impact all members of the Cardano community. Grants will be provided for translations of the original text into other languages so more members of the community are able to read it. Because it may not be possible for translations to capture the exact legal meaning of the original text. the English version will remain the authoritative source. The Interim Constitution and translations will be displayed within the Constitutional Committee portal. Translate the entire Interim Constitution (including appendices) into another language. Protocol parameter names should be left in English. The translated version begins with this translated warning message: This version of the Cardano Constitution has been translated from the original.

A motion is the topic under discussion (e. “I move that we add a coffee break to this meeting”). After  being recognized by the president of the board. any member can introduce a motion when no other  motion is on the table. A motion requires a second to be considered. If there is no second. the matter is  not considered. Each motion must be disposed of (passed. defeated. tabled. referred to committee. or  postponed indefinitely). You want to bring up a new idea before the group. After recognition by the president of the board. present your motion.

Adding words. striking words or. striking and inserting words. You like the idea of a motion being discussed. but you need to reword it beyond simple word  changes. Move to substitute your motion for the original motion. If it is seconded. discussion will continue  on both motions and eventually the body will vote on which motion they prefer. You want more study and/or investigation given to the idea being discussed. Move to refer to a committee. Try to be specific as to the charge to the committee. You want more time personally to study the proposal being discussed. Move to postpone to a definite time or date. You are tired of the current discussion. Move to limit debate to a set period of time or to a set number of speakers. Requires a 2/3rds vote. You have heard enough discussion. Move to close the debate. Also referred to as calling the question. This cuts off discussion and brings the assembly to a vote on the pending question only. You want to postpone a motion until some later time. Move to table the motion. The motion may be taken from the table after 1 item of business has  been conducted. If the motion is not taken from the table by the end of the next meeting. it is  dead. To kill a motion at the time it is tabled requires a 2/3rdsvote. A majority is required to table a motion without killing it. You believe the discussion has drifted away from the agenda and want to bring it back. “Call for orders of the day. You want to take a short break. Move to recess for a set period of time.

The Voltaire program is an ambitious and broad-reaching exercise in blockchain governance. Here’s a primer on some key terms you should know. Are there any terms we’ve missed here? We’ll continue to add new terminology here as needed over time. so let us know on X (formerly Twitter) via @intersectmbo!. ada is Cardano’s native currency. ada has six decimal places. and these fractions of ada are called lovelaces. ada can be used to pay transaction fees on the Cardano network and can also be delegated as a stake to a stake pool. Cardano Ballot is a hybrid on/off-chain polling system created by the Cardano Foundation in collaboration with IOG that leverages the Cardano blockchain for immutable. and verifiable tallying of votes. Verifiable vote receipts are recorded on-chain. Cardano Ballot is one of the tools used in the governance process. one of the committees forming at Intersect. will help orchestrate community activities to steer the Constitutional process throughout 2024 toward the goal of community ratification at a Constitutional Convention later that year. the Civics Committee may support a larger governance remit by providing transparency and recommendations. A Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) is a technical document that proposes changes.',\n",
       " ' or enhancements to the Cardano blockchain. its processes. or its environment. CIPs are intended as the primary mechanisms for proposing new features. and documenting design decisions implemented on Cardano. Because CIPs are text files in a versioned repository. In the Cardano ecosystem. the term “institutions” refers to entities or collectives composed of multiple community members pooling expertise to support specific needs or aspects of the Cardano environment. Such institutions will help provide additional structure to governance while contributing to the Cardano ecosystems growth. and adoption. Their involvement strengthens the network effect. fosters innovation. and expands the reach & impact of Cardanos decentralized solutions. Contrasting with the traditionally negative notion of being bureaucratic and unyielding. these modern institutions within Cardano operate on principles of transparency. and accountability. They foster a democratic system where power is distributed among users. facilitating a collaborative decision-making process. Anyone can express interest in starting a new institution or joining an existing one. An institution will be wound down as the ecosystem members deem it no longer necessary. One example of a Cardano institution is Intersect. a member-based organization bringing together companies. individuals. and other ecosystem participants to shape and drive the future development of Cardano. Other institutions include Cardano Guild. Cardano RealFi Consortium. DeFi Alliance. NFT Alliance. Cardano institutions. including newly established ones like Intersect. nurture the ecosystem by encouraging community contributions and facilitating dialogues for a consensus-driven advancement of the Cardano platform. They are designed to be fluid. adaptable to changes. and even dissolve when they no longer serve a necessary function. embodying a new era of responsive and community-led governance structures. A Cardano Problem Statement (CPS) is a formalized document for the Cardano ecosystem and the name of the process by which such documents are produced and listed. the stewardship of core Cardano repositories has been passed from Input Output Global (IOG) to Intersect – the member-based organization tasked with maintaining Cardano’s infrastructure and sustaining its expansion. The Cardano Constitutional Convention event will occur in Buenos Aires in 2024 as part of the journey towards a ratified Cardano constitution. Constitutional conventions exist to discuss and define a draft constitution. which will be proposed for an on-chain vote. A historical parallel for 2024s Cardano Constitutional Convention can be drawn with the U. Constitutional Convention of 1787. held in Philadelphia. Following intense debate. the convention resulted in the signing of the first draft of the U. Constitution on September 17. The new Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation and proposed an entirely new form of government. A governance action will be enacted once it is ratified (see below). CIP-1694 defines seven different governance actions:. New constitutional committee and/or threshold and/or term limits. Updates to the Constitution. Hard fork initiation. Protocol parameter changes. Treasury withdrawals. Information. A fully formed Constitution will be developed and ratified through a series of community-led workshops and a larger convention in Buenos Aires throughout 2024. Before that. an Interim Constitution will provide guardrails and an initial constitutional framework that the Cardano community can further develop and ultimately ratify.',\n",
       " ' Read more on Cardano’s Governance here. Intersect is a member-based organization tasked with ensuring the continuity and future development of the Cardano blockchain and its ecosystem. Intersect is a key institution for the ecosystem. bringing together companies. Intersect members can apply for grants for specific projects and initiatives pertaining to the continuity and development of the Cardano network. With CIP-1694. grants will initially be focused on enhancing governance tools for the Cardano ecosystem in the age of Voltaire. The members-based organization (MBO) for Cardano. now named Intersect. is an organization designed to foster the future development of Cardano. serving as an aggregation point for community governance. Intersect was recently established and includes various stakeholders with shared values and common goals coordinating resources required for maintaining and enhancing the Cardano ecosystem. The members will be part of boards. and working groups that define. deliver. and communicate public works projects revolving around Cardano’s open-source technologies. Intersect’s main focus area is the future maintenance and development of Cardano. achieved through five key pillars:. supporting community development. administrating community-led governance. coordinating the delivery of the community-approved roadmap overseeing Cardano’s continuity for system stability. guiding the open-source development of Cardano’s core technologies. CIP-1694 describes Minimum Viable On-Chain Governance (MVG) as a baseline on-chain rules. mechanisms. and entities that advance ada holders’ ability to engage in Cardano governance. MVG aims to establish a baseline of democratic consent. one that is stable and secure for the continuity of the blockchain yet can be further developed and improved over time. The Parameter Committee will be one of the standing committees under Intersect. Initially being bootstrapped by IOG. and the Cardano Foundation with members of the stake pool operator (SPO) community. the committee will issue non-binding recommendations for the parameters of the Cardano protocol. and discuss all protocol parameters including network. Project Catalyst is the world’s largest decentralized innovation engine for solving real-world challenges. Catalyst was set up in 2020. and within two years.000 members had set hundreds of projects underway with a treasury worth $1 billion ada. The project marked the start of Cardano’s Voltaire phase and is one of the world’s largest examples of on-chain governance. Project Catalyst’s most recent fund. Fund10. saw over 40K votes cast to distribute 50m ada to projects building in the ecosystem. Catalyst is currently the vehicle for community members to access Cardano treasury funding. Its role will continue to evolve as CIP-1694 opens up Cardano treasury withdrawal governance actions. A person or organization responsible for setting up and keeping the pool running. and maintaining and monitoring a node validating Cardano blockchain transactions. Based at Intersect. the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is an advisory group that ensures that the governance of Cardano is founded upon sound technical awareness and best practices. The TSC will cover a broad spectrum of technical aspects of Cardano’s network and form working groups focussing on particular domains. Voltaire is the fifth building phase of Cardano development in the original roadmap. Voltaire will continue the transformation of the Cardano network to a self-sustaining system.',\n",
       " ' pioneering a new standard for community-driven governance in blockchain technology. Once implemented. the Cardano community will be empowered with new tools to continue driving the decision-making and steering of Cardano. A Constitution will provide the framework and guardrails for collective decision-making. A working group brings together experts and committed community members around one specific topic of discussion. at Intersect. working groups typically roll up to a committee. Each group sets its own goals regarding solutions to drive ecosystem success and adoption going forward. Intersect is currently facilitating the creation and bootstrapping of these expert groups. The ultimate goal is community empowerment to self-mobilize and collaborate on decision-making processes and solution implementation.Building together in the age of Voltaire.

As an SPO. you can take charge and run the testnet network with diligence and integrity and of course. you can influence Baratarias future voting on relevant actions. Your feedback will be invaluable. Delegate representatives (DReps):. DReps are the voice of the broader community. As a representative. your role involves participating in voting on governance actions. You can consider the collective interests of the community as you engage in these important decisions. SanchoNet is all about developing and testing the technical components and processes required to action governance for Cardano within CIP-1694. It informs and engages the Cardano community on Voltaire on-chain governance activities currently underway. To fully utilize the on-chain components as they are designed for ultimate use on mainnet. a significant program of off-chain elements (eg committees. informational tools. etc) will also need to be delivered. subject to a separate complimentary roadmap and timeline. SanchoNet will follow an independent development trajectory scoped from a technical. rather than final. governance perspective. SanchoNet will encapsulate the various actions and use cases that SPOs. and other users will undertake within typical usage situations as the wider governance capabilities are rolled out. not all SanchoNet functionality will operate initially as intended (for example.',\n",
       " ' within constitutional actions). and will be subject to change and iteration during the course of development. SanchoNet is more than just a testnet. it is a playground of opportunities.

Don Quixote’s companion in Miguel de Cervantes’ literary classic. In the narrative. Sanchos transformation from a humble farmer to a wise governor and loyal friend mirrors virtues that align with the principles steering the evolution and governance of this network. Sanchos growth throughout the novel represents a synthesis of realism and idealism. He starts with a practical. down-to-earth perspective but gradually appreciates and even embraces the nobility in Don Quixotes vision of chivalry. His transformation culminates in the episode of governing the fictional Island of Barataria. where his innate wisdom and common sense guide him in delivering fair and wise judgments. Sanchos capability to harmonize pragmatic realities with lofty ideals mirrors the essence of SanchoNet. Much like Sancho. the mission of SanchoNet is to cultivate a system that remains grounded in reality while guided by visionary principles. The ultimate goal? To establish a platform where every voice holds significance. embracing inclusivity and pragmatic wisdom in governance. The choice of SanchoNet also mirrors the characters transformative journey. echoing the broader themes of growth. self-assurance. and integrity that resonate throughout Don Quixote.  The parallel between Sancho and the chivalric code. his self-discovery. and his courage to embrace the extraordinary within himself symbolizes Cardanos aspiration to innovate. empower individuals. and attain greatness. the intimate relationship between Don Quixote and Sancho. characterized by friendship. mutual influence. and a complex balance between dreams and reality. parallels the collaborative spirit that SanchoNet aims to cultivate within the Cardano community. This partnership transcends mere transactional engagements and evolves into a collective journey toward a more equitable. visionary. and improved ecosystem.Alonso Quijano. the man who would become Don Quixote. begins as an ordinary gentleman from the La Mancha region. Hes known to be deeply fixated on books of chivalry. This eventually causes him to lose touch with reality. He decides to resurrect the age of chivalry. renaming himself Don Quixote de la Mancha.  This signifies the onset of his transformation. both in regard to his identity and how the world views him. In the beginning. Don Quixotes idealism is unrestrained and almost childlike.',\n",
       " ' He perceives the world through a fantastical lens. turning windmills into giants and common inns into castles. His commitment to chivalric codes and virtues is unwavering. albeit frequently misdirected. His notions of honor. justice. and love are drawn from his readings. not real-life encounters. This often leads him into absurd and humorous predicaments. Don Quixotes idealism often materializes as a stubborn refusal to see the world as it truly is. exemplified by his renowned attack on windmills that he misidentifies as giants. As the novel unfolds. Don Quixotes character gradually evolves. The initial portrayal of a madman driven by unattainable dreams slowly gives way to a more nuanced and intricate individual. Despite his delusions. nobility resides in his ideals that begin to resonate with those around him. His faith in his knightly mission affects those he encounters. and even those who initially dismiss him as mad come to recognize the sincerity and purity of his beliefs. While his squire. Sancho Panza. serves as a foil and grounding influence. Don Quixote also influences Sancho. The relationship between the two characters deepens. as each leaves their mark on the other. Don Quixotes lofty ideals gradually meld with a more pragmatic grasp of reality. while Sancho starts to appreciate the merits of his masters chivalric worldview. As the story concludes. Don Quixotes character experiences a remarkable evolution. His adventures have led to personal growth. deepening wisdom. and a more profound. understanding of himself and the world around him. The sharp contrast between idealism and realism has dissolved. giving rise to a more harmonized and human portrayal. The culmination of this evolution arrives with the tragic realization of his madness and his decision to forsake his knightly persona. reverting back to Alonso Quijano. This final transformation is tinged with sadness. as it signifies the loss of the beautiful ideals that drove him. but it also represents a return to sanity and a reconciliation with the real world. The character of Don Quixote is multi-layered. showcasing a complex evolution. Starting from the naive and delusional Quijano. progressing to the quixotic yet profoundly honorable Don Quixote. and culminating in the wiser and more self-aware man by the narratives closure. Cervantes skillfully constructs a character that encapsulates the human conflict between idealism and reality. His journey resonates because it mirrors the quest for meaning. virtue. and self-understanding. making Don Quixote a timeless and universal figure in literature.Sancho Panza. initially depicted as a simple farmer. evolves remarkably throughout the story of Don Quixote.  His evolution begins upon becoming the squire of Don Quixote. motivated by the promise of material wealth and the opportunity to govern an island. Though Sancho starts as a counterpoint to Don Quixotes lofty idealism. embodying pragmatism and practicality. his persona gradually deepens. becoming more nuanced and complex. As Sancho accompanies Don Quixote on his chivalric endeavors. he finds himself drawn into the world of ideals and imagination. Though never entirely abandoning his earthy wisdom. Sancho gradually recognizes the nobility within his masters vision. He starts to see beyond the surface of things.',\n",
       " ' recognizing the deeper values of justice. honor. and compassion that underpin Don Quixotes seemingly mad pursuits. The most profound change in Sanchos character comes during his time as the governor of the fictional Island of Barataria.  Initially intended as a jest. this episode evolves into a profound experience for Sancho. Faced with the complexities of leadership and governance. Sancho rises to the challenge. He applies his simple wisdom and innate. understanding of human nature to solve intricate problems. Instead of becoming confused or overwhelmed. Sancho demonstrates a remarkable ability to govern justly and wisely. The experience of governing Barataria has a lasting impact on Sancho. reinforcing his self-assurance and deepening his understanding of leadership and responsibility. It also. further aligns him with Don Quixotes chivalric code. showing him that ideals and practicality can coexist and that ordinary people are capable of extraordinary things. Sanchos relationship with Don Quixote continues to evolve. moving from servitude to genuine friendship. He becomes a true companion. sharing Don Quixotes dreams and defending. them against the skepticism of others. By the end of the story. Sanchos character grows into a synthesis of realism and idealism. embodying the wisdom of the common man and the. nobility of the knight-errant. Sanchos evolution is a testament to the profound impact of friendship. idealism. and personal growth. His journey reflects the novels rich exploration of human nature. presenting a timeless portrayal of an ordinary man achieving greatness through wisdom. and the courage to embrace the extraordinary within himself.Barataria plays a unique and significant role in Don Quixote.  While existing only in fiction. its symbolism and the events that unfold within its imagined boundaries. contribute meaningfully to the novels exploration of leadership. and reality. In the story. Barataria is a fictional island promised to Sancho Panza. Don Quixotes loyal squire. as a reward for his devoted service. The pledge of ruling Barataria fuels Sanchos dreams and expectations. When a duke and duchess. entertained by Don Quixote and Sancho. decide to actualize this promise. they execute an elaborate prank by appointing Sancho as the governor of the nonexistent island. The Barataria episode offers an opportunity to explore Sanchos character. unveiling his practical wisdom and inherent common sense. Despite the absurd situations aimed at testing and mocking him. Sancho governs with dignity. simplicity. and intelligence. His judgments and decrees are marked by a natural grasp of justice and human nature. Instead of becoming a fool in a comedic setting. Sancho turns Barataria into a stage for showcasing his authentic wisdom and leadership. Barataria also serves as a mirror to the broader themes of the novel. Just as Don Quixotes idealism often clashes with the harsh realities of the world. Sanchos time in Barataria illustrates the tension between appearance and substance. dream and reality. folly and wisdom. It is a microcosm of the novels intricate dance between the world as it is and the world as it could be. Barataria serves as a link between the lofty ideals of chivalry embodied by Don Quixote and the grounded realism of Sancho.',\n",
       " ' Within this imaginary island. the dreams of both characters converge. and their contrasts find a harmonious resolution. In Western literature. the Barataria episode has transcended its origin to become a symbol of leadership that is wise. compassionate. and unpretentious. It stands as a reminder that true wisdom often resides in simplicity and that leadership can be found in the most unlikely places.The Constitution is an off-chain document with its hash registered on-chain. A provisional Constitution. containing essential provisions and safeguards necessary. for the implementation of CIP-1694. has been published here. This provisional document is intended as a. temporary measure. The final Constitution. which will require  ratification by Ada holders. is expected to be approved by late 2024 or early 2025. the Constitution is supplemented by a set of Guardrails to ensure the blockchain operates securely and sustainably. These guardrails are designed. to prevent unexpected issues with the operation of the Cardano Blockchain. They aim to guide the selection of sensible parameter settings and mitigate potential. problems related to security. or functionality. Some of these guardrails are automatable and will be enforced via an on-chain script or built-in. ledger rules. The Constitution is accompanied by a guardrails script. At any given time. there can only be one guardrails script. and its hash is also registered on-chain. The. guardrails script enforces limits on protocol parameter changes and treasury withdrawals. This script is executed whenever a governance action attempts to change. protocol parameters or make a treasury withdrawal. If the proposal adheres to the guardrails. it is accepted on-chain and can be considered by the governance bodies:. the Constitutional Committee. if the proposed change exceeds the guardrails. the action is deemed unconstitutional upon submission. the transaction is rejected. reducing the risk of introducing undesirable changes to the protocol parameters. The Constitutional Committee is a group of individuals or entities. each associated with a pair of Ed25519 credentials or a script. collectively responsible. for safeguarding the integrity of the constitution within the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. The Constitutional Committee operates based on a social contract with the networks actors. focusing solely on voting for actions that align with the constitution. This ensures the upholding of the fundamental principles and values of the blockchain. Its important to note that the Constitutional Committee has the authority to reject certain governance actions by voting no.  However. committee members should. exercise this power judiciously. using it only when actions clearly conflict with the constitution. As the guardian of the blockchains integrity. the Constitutional Committee ensures that the network operates in harmony with its established principles. Through. responsible decision-making and adherence to the constitution. the committee contributes to the sustainable and prosperous future of the blockchain ecosystem. Becoming a member of the constitutional committee involves off-chain procedures. The detailed process to join will be outlined in the upcoming weeks. Similar to how SPOs manage their cold/KES keys. committee members will utilize a cold/hot key setup. developing a solid understanding of the generation. and secure management of these keys becomes crucial for those aspiring to join the committee.',\n",

Each type of governance action represents a distinct feature within cardano-node and cardano-cli. they will be rolled out in phases. coinciding with the integration of each feature. Once on chain. specific governance groups need to vote on the action depending on its type. The following. table details the ratification requirements for each governance action scenario. The SPO vote threshold which must be met as a percentage of the stake held by all stake pools. | 7. parameters:. To get ratified. a governance action needs to accumulate enough votes according to the specified thresholds. A governance action. expires if it does not receive enough votes during its governance action lifetime. Ratified governance actions are automatically enacted at the epoch boundary following their ratification. The only exception is when a Motion of No Confidence is enacted prior to the enactment of other actions. the ratified. but not yet enacted actions are not enacted. these actions are put back for voting for the remainder of their lifetime. If a new. committee is elected before these actions expire. they can still be ratified. but the new committee must approve them.

The overall purpose of a Constitution Script is to define. in Plutus. that part of the Cardano Constitution which is possible to. be automated as a smart contract. in this repository. we are focusing on defining a constitution. script to check that a ParameterChange proposal or TreasuryWithdrawals proposal. is constitutional. we may. enhance the script to automate more parts of the Cardano Constitution. The script is written in the high-level PlutusTx language. is subsequently compiled to Untyped Plutus Core and executed. on then chain upon every new Governance Proposal. Being a smart contract. the constitution script is a validator function of the form:. The sole argument to this function is the BuiltinData-encoded V3. ScriptContext. Note the absence of the 2 extra arguments. previously known as Datum argument and the Redeemer argument. Since V3 and CIP-69. the Datum and Redeemer values are not passed anymore as separate function arguments. but embedded inside the V3. ScriptContext argument. The proposal under investigation is also embedded inside the ScriptContext. Datum is not provided for the constitution script. since it is not a spending validator. Redeemer will be provided to the constitution script. but the current script. implementations ignore any value given to it (see Clause D). When the script is fully applied. one of the 2 cases can happen:. The script executes successfully by returning BuiltinUnit. which means that the Proposal under investigation is. constitutional (the next step of the process would be to vote on this proposal. but this is out-of-scope of this repository). The script fails with an error. There can be many different reasons for a script error:.',\n",
       " ' Irregardless of the specific error. the outcome is the same: the proposal would be un-constitutional (and no further steps will be taken for this proposal). The constitution rules (a. guardrails) may change in the future. which may require that the constitution script. be also accordingly updated. and re-submitted on the chain so as to be enacted. To minimise the chances of introducing bugs when the constititution script has to be updated. we decided to separate the fixed logic part of the script from the. possibly evolving part. the constitution rules. the constitution rules are separately given as a PlutusTx ADT. (with type Config). which when applied to the fixed-logic part (named engine for short). yields the actual constitution script:. the Config is eliminated statically at compile-time. by partially applying it to. the constitution engine. These constitution rules can be thought of as predicates (PlutusTx functions that return Bool). over the proposed values. We currently have 3 such predicates:. An alternative & preferred method than constructing a Config inside Haskell. is to. edit a configuration file that contains the constitution rules laid out in JSON. Its default location is at data/defaultConstitution. json. with its expected JSON schema specified at data/defaultConstitution. schema. After editing this JSON configuration file and re-compiling the cabal package. the JSON will be statically translated. to a Config PlutusTx-value and applied to the engine to yield a new script. This is the preferred method because. first. it does not require any prior PlutusTx/Haskell knowledge. and second. there can be extra sanity checks applied: e. when parsing/translating the JSON to Config. or when using an external JSON schema validator. In case of a ParameterChange governance action. the ledger will construct out of the proposed parameters. a ChangedParameters value. encode it as BuiltinData. then pass it onto us (the Constitution script) inside the V3. This BuiltinData object has the following format (in pseudocode):. where Map.I.List are the constructors of PlutusCore. and Integer is the usual arbitrary-precision PlutusTx/Haskell Integer. There is no other type of a changed parameter (e. nested-list parameter). so the script implementations will fail on any other format. There can be many different implementations of the logic (engine) made for the constitution script. A particular script implementation behaves correctly (is valid). when it. complies with all the following clauses:. Although not part of the specification. the. ledger provides us extra guarantees. which a valid implementation may optionally. rely upon (i. take it as an assumption):. There are 2 engine implementations:. Unsorted and Sorted must be valid implementations. so they must comply to all clauses S01. Unsorted does not rely on any ledger guarantees. Sorted as the name implies relies on sortedness to work and thus assumes the G01.G02 guarantees. Sorted further requires that the Config is also sorted. which must be guaranteed by-construction when using the JSON Config format. (this is not currently guaranteed when manually constructing a Config ADT value). Note that. although all implementations could theoretically work without problem with negative proposedParam ids. the Config JSON format (not the ADT) and the Ledger are limited only to positive ids (see G07).',\n",
       " ' The Sorted implementation is the selected implementation to be used on the mainnet chain. The testing infrastructure generates artificial proposals and unit/random tests them. against the 2 valid implementations. unsorted and sorted. The artificial proposals are built such as to satisfy all specification clauses S01.  (required for validity). Since this repositorys testing infrastructure cannot be aware or test the ledgers behavior. we have to make explicit the ledger guarantees  that the test code needs to rely upon. To keep things simple and uniform. we decided that the (random) testing infrastructure has to rely on. the union (Sum) of the ledger guarantees required by all our current implementations. G01.G02.

Cardano is conducting a major conversion process to reach completely decentralized through the On-Chain management system. This process is guided by the proposal to improve Cardano (CIP) 1694. marking a major turning point in developing Cardanos blockchain platform. The focus of this governance model is the community. including those holding ADA and active members in the ecosystem. Cardano in Cardanos management system. has three main roles:. The management system on Cardano has seven main types of administrative actions:. The management process on Cardano consists of four stages:. Cardanos on-chain management model is designed to ensure transparency. fairness. and community cohesion. With the introduction of CIP 1694 and new governance features. Cardano is gradually towards a complete decentralized system. Those who hold ADA. through voting rights. can directly affect the future of this blockchain. The management process is not only a technical contribution but also the participation. sharing of opinions and making community decisions. vn. Share this article on Twitter | Facebook | Telegram.

       " ' Stake. pools use the Cardano node to. form the backbone of the Cardano network by processing transactions and. validating and producing blocks. Stake pool roles include a stake pool operator and one or more stake pool. owner(s). It is important to note the conceptual differences between the two:. Usually. the stake pool operator and the owner are the same person. stake pool can have multiple owners that choose to combine their pledge. should be noted that the stake pools declared pledge must be met by the. combined stake in the owners wallets and failure to do so will result in the. pool being unable to produce blocks. All operator and owner rewards are paid out into a single rewards account. associated with the reward address of the pool. If a stake pool has multiple. owners. it is up to the owner of the rewards account to distribute rewards to. the operator and other owners. An agreement is likely needed to define when and how the accumulated rewards in. a shared account should be split. they can agree to have the. operator control the shared account. or they can choose to use a multisig. account. To run a pool effectively. a bi-directional relationship and trust are crucial. If this trust is broken. other parties can lose in regards to accumulated or. potential rewards. or reputation for the operator. Developer resources:. Cardano is an open-source project.

The concept of epochs is central to how Cardano’s Ouroboros Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol functions. Here’s how epochs work:. If Cardano didn’t have epochs. several key aspects of its blockchain functionality. and efficiency would be impacted. Here’s how the absence of epochs would affect the Cardano network:. Epochs are a fundamental component of Cardano’s architecture. providing structure. and efficiency to the network. Without epochs. the Cardano blockchain would face significant challenges in managing block production. distributing rewards. maintaining security. and scaling effectively. The loss of epochs would likely lead to a less predictable.',\n",
       " ' less fair. and less secure network. undermining many of the benefits that Cardano currently offers. Purpose:To divide the blockchain into fixed time periods. making it easier to manage block creation. staking rewards. and validator selection. Key Function:Each epoch (lasting 5 days) selects new validators (slot leaders) to create blocks. distribute staking rewards. and reset the network for the next round of operations. Simplest Explanation:Epochs are like “rounds” on Cardano that last 5 days. In each round. new people are chosen to help run the network. and rewards are given out for helping keep everything secure. epochs in Cardano serve as the basic time unit that structures the network’s operations. including block production. reward distribution. and protocol updates. ensuring that the system runs smoothly and efficiently. An epoch is a fixed time period (5 days) during which a set of tasks are performed on the Cardano blockchain. such as validator selection. block creation. and reward distribution. Epochs divide the blockchain’s operations into manageable time periods. allowing for regular updates. staking rewards distribution. and ensuring the security and decentralization of the network by periodically selecting new validators. Each epoch lasts exactly 5 days. When you delegate your ADA to a stake pool. your rewards are calculated based on the pool’s performance during each epoch. These rewards are distributed at the end of every epoch. usually after a slight delay. validators (slot leaders) are chosen at the beginning of each epoch. This means the set of participants responsible for validating blocks can change every 5 days. depending on how much ADA is staked. Staking rewards are calculated at the end of an epoch and distributed after a short delay. typically in the next epoch. Slot leaders are validators selected within each epoch to validate transactions and create new blocks. They are chosen based on the amount of ADA they or their delegators have staked. The transition between epochs is seamless. At the end of each 5-day period. a new set of slot leaders is selected. and the staking rewards from the previous epoch are finalized and distributed. If a slot leader fails to validate a block in their assigned time slot. another slot leader is chosen in the following slots to maintain the integrity of the blockchain. The missed block is skipped. but the blockchain continues to function normally. A stake pool’s performance is evaluated at the end of each epoch. If the pool successfully creates blocks during its assigned slots. it earns rewards. which are distributed among delegators based on the amount staked. staking rewards can vary based on the performance of the stake pool. network parameters. and the total amount of ADA staked during that epoch. Epochs do not directly affect individual transaction times. but they play a role in how the network operates behind the scenes. including validator rotation and reward distribution. you can delegate your ADA at any time. but your staking rewards will start accruing after the current epoch ends and will be paid out in subsequent epochs.',\n",

This content is for technical people; if you are looking for a Cardano wallet please head to the showcase section. It is noteworthy to mention that the Developer Portal covers everything you can do today on the Cardano mainnet. Cardano is a collection of open-source. patent-free protocols. Its a platform that enables you to store. transform. and manage value. identity. Cardano follows research not opinions or bias. Cardano started as a significant research and development project in 2015. and it took almost two years of research to get to a position to start writing code. The purpose of Cardano was to ask: How can we build a sustainable financial and social operating system for billions of people? What collections of technologies do we need to bring together to get everything at an affordable cost?. Besides cryptographic research. there was game-theoretic research. identity-management research. and programming-language research. This academic rigor process produced more than 100 academic papers. Most were accepted in cryptography conferences like Eurocrypt and Asiacrypt and went through the standard peer-review process. the paper “Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocol” was one of the most cited security papers from 2015-2019. To get the most out of the Cardano Developer Portal. you should  have programming experience and a basic understanding of blockchain concepts of Cardano such as UTxO. transactions. addresses. key derivation. and networking.

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Please find the project structure and more detailed information on developers.Here we show you how to integrate Cardano into existing websites and services.The Cardano Transaction Metadata feature allows anyone to embed metadata into transactions. which is then stored in the blockchain. The following are the four most common uses of metadata:. Validation and verification. Metadata can be utilized to check and verify external physical objects and legitimate content. as the Cardano Foundation has demonstrated with Scantrust and Baias Wine. This necessitates coupling with a physical identifier. such as a QR-code. but its especially beneficial for low-cost supply chain tracking of fast-moving consumer goods. Authentication and attribution. There are frequently physical identifiers to confirm the authenticity of credentials received from an educational institution. membership group. or similar. This is more difficult for digital courses and accreditations. For a low fee. a transaction with metadata might serve as an immutable and always-accessible evidence of certification. Secure record of information. Metadata attached to a transaction and confirmed on the Cardano blockchain is immutable. This means that no one can alter it. and it will last as long as the Cardano blockchain exists. This is a fantastic way to save and back up vital information. or even just to leave a humorous message for the future. Timestamping. Any transaction that requires payment data to be attached. as well as the history of ownership of particular assets. can benefit from timestamping. Metadata can be used to create a timestamp within a transaction. allowing anyone to verify the time and date of a purchase. sale. or transfer. Metadata. in essence. can be utilized to tell a transactions story. Metadata can act as a confirmation or assurance of authenticity when combined with off-chain infrastructure such as physical identifiers. The Cardano Foundations integrations team hosted a session on transaction metadata on January 18. Jeremy Firster and Mel McCann from the Cardano Foundations integrations team delivered the workshop. Jeremy and Mel introduced transaction metadata and discussed its potential for creating Cardano apps with IOHKs Alan McSherry and Ben OHanlon. The slides of the presentation are also available. Metadata can be expressed as a JSON object with some restrictions:. All top-level keys must be integers between 0 and 2^64 - 1. Each metadata value is tagged with its type.',\n",
       " ' Strings must be at most 64 bytes when UTF-8 is encoded. Bytestrings are hex-encoded. with a maximum length of 64 bytes. Metadata arent stored as JSON on the Cardano blockchain but are instead stored using a compact binary encoding (CBOR). The binary encoding of metadata values supports three simple types:. It is possible to transform any JSON object into this schema. according to your requirements. if your application uses floating-point values. they will need to be converted somehow. for null or bool values. when reading metadata from the chain. be aware that integers may exceed the programming language of choice numeric range and may need special bigint parsing. Example metadata:. This is equivalent to the normalized JSON version:. We invite developers to experiment using Cardano Transaction Metadata and come up with new ideas. well go over the various methods for creating a transaction that includes metadata.There are currently two ways to make your NFTs:. Minting requires a certain amount of skill in navigating and working with Linux through the terminal and a running Cardano node. We will not go into how to spin up a Cardano node. but this is covered in the integrate Cardano category. The Cardano Blockchain has the unique ability to create. interact with. and delete bespoke tokens (or assets) natively. In this example. native means that. in addition to sending and receiving the official currency ada. you may interact with custom assets right out of the box - without the use of smart contracts. Native assets can practically be treated as ada in every sense because the capability is already built-in. there are some limitations (which well discuss later). but you can think of native assets as a way to produce your own custom for the time being. Before we go any further. heres a quick rundown of what you need to know. Almost all interactions with the Cardano network/blockchain are transaction-based. We can divide interactions into two tiers with this in mind. The top layer emphasizes a visual approach and covers standard interaction. Sending and receiving ada or tokens. delegating your stake. and voting are all examples of this. Wallets such as the full node Daedalus wallet or the lighter Yoroi wallet can be used to carry out these interactions. if we want to drill down and have more options for interacting and creating custom interactions. we must go one step deeper. Well need a whole node in this layer to send transactions with specified parameters. A full node is often a built binary from the official latest cardano-node repository. There are more options. but well concentrate on the Linux version. what kinds of sophisticated transactions can we create with a full node. and how can we do it? Working on the command line and issuing transactions from there is the current method. Stake pool operators must utilize this method of transaction to register their stake pool or make changes to their commitment. we may utilize this method to produce. send. receive. and burn tokens.',\n",
       " ' this probably will also be the place where smart contracts are written. tested. and maybe executed if there isnt a visual frontend. Since we already learned that interaction with the network is almost always a transaction. we need to be aware of a few things enforced through network parameters. Please keep those constraints in mind if you want to work with native assets. In terms of technology. there isn\\\\t much of a distinction between regular tokens/native assets and NFTs. This is due to the fact that both can be produced using the cardano node cli and are native assets. Unlike fungible native assets. which might consist of millions of interchangeable tokens. an NFT is a single native asset that cannot be re-minted or destroyed. and it exists on the blockchain in perpetuity.Smart contracts are digital agreements defined in code that automate and enforce the terms of a contract without the need for intermediaries. enabling secure and transparent transactions on a blockchain. By leveraging predetermined conditions defined within the smart contract code. the state of a contract can only be updated in a way that follows the rules defined in that contract. On the Cardano blockchain. the compiled code of smart contracts is stored on. and distributed across. the decentralised network. It is not possible to modify the rules of an existing smart contract. nor is it possible to decompile the stored smart contract code from its compiled state into the original source code. As mentioned in the general overview. smart contracts on Cardano work a bit differently from how they do on other blockchains. The key to understanding smart contracts is to first understand the eUTXO model. Smart contracts are more or less just a piece of code that you write to validate the movement of UTXOs locked in your contracts address. You will lock UTXOs at the address of your script and then the UTXOs can only ever be spent/moved if your script allows the transaction spending it to do so. Smart contracts consist of on-chain and off-chain components:. Important to note here is that smart contracts heavily rely on the datum attached to a UTXO. using it as part of the contract instance state to be used in further transactions. If no datum is attached to a UTXO residing on the contracts address. it can end up being locked there forever. Validator scripts are executed automatically when a UTXO residing at the address of the script is attempted to be moved by a transaction. These scripts take a transaction as its input and then outputs either true or false depending on whether the transaction is valid or not according to your rules/logic as defined in the script - thus blocking or allowing a transaction to succeed. If you are moving multiple UTXOs residing on the same script address. the validator-script will run once for each UTXO. This script execution happens on the Cardano node validating your transaction. This means that in order for the validator-script to execute. a transaction must first move a UTXO to the address of the contract; the address is derived from the contract mathematically.',\n",
       " ' You do not need to upload your contract to the chain. although that is also possible using reference scripts. You might think of this initial transaction where you move a UTXO to the script address to be the initialisation of a contract instance. Each UTXO residing on the address of the contract can thus be seen as an instance of the contract. Note that there is no restriction on the UTXOs being sent to the script address: anyone can send a UTXO containing no datum. or a fake datum. The off-chain part is needed in order to locate UTXOs that are locked in your contract and generate transactions that are valid for moving them. For contracts that require multiple steps to complete. it is common to encode the state of a contract inside of a datum using a specific schema of your own design that is then attached to each transaction. You would then create a thread of UTXOs by designing a validator such that it only allows moving the UTXO to the script address so that the value of the UTXO remains locked in the new UTXO. but with a new datum/state. Smart contracts are really very simple constructs based on validator-scripts which you now know are just some logic/rules created by you to be enforced by the Cardano nodes when they see a transaction attempting to move a UTXO locked inside of your scripts address. Because the validator script has access to read the transaction context (things like who signed it and which assets are being sent to/from where) and datum of the locked UTXO being moved. you can build some very complex contracts this way. Marlowe is a good example of this technique used in practice. More specifically. the validator scripts are passed these three pieces of information as arguments:. Datum: this is a piece of data attached to the output that the script is locking. This is typically used to carry state. Redeemer: this is a piece of data attached to the spending input. This is typically used to provide an input to the script from the spender. your validator can use a function to apply the redeemer contents to the datum and verify that it gets the same result as what the output UTXO datum is set to. Context: this is a piece of data that represents information about the spending transaction. This is used to make assertions about the way the output is being sent (such as “Bob signed it”). The information contained in the context and thus available for your script to read:. This is only an example! The validator does not need to rely on hashsums - you can have any logic you want here. You create a validator-script that compares the datum in the UTXO being moved from the contracts address to the hash of the redeemer being used in the transaction moving it. This is your on-chain component. You create a script. using your language of choice. that creates a transaction moving some amount of ada or other assets to the address of the validator-script.',\n",
       " ' When generating the transaction you specify the datum to be Hash(secret) making sure that only the hashsum of the word secret gets stored on-chain. This is your off-chain component. You sign and submit the transaction to a Cardano node either directly or via one of many available APIs such as Blockfrost or Dandelion. Now the ada you sent to the contract is locked by your validator. The only way for anyone to move this locked ada now is to generate a transaction with the word \\\\secret\\\\ as a redeemer. as the UTXO is locked in the script which will enforce this rule you created where the hashsum of the redeemer must match Hash(secret). Normally. your datum would be more complicated than this. and the person running the contract might not know how it is supposed to work at all. so they would rely on your off-chain component to create the transaction - often this is something you would provide an API for. Expanding on the basic workflow. imagine that you want to create a contract that required multiple steps. Such a contract might be one that requires 3 different people to agree on who should be able to claim the value locked in a contract instance. Your on-chain component. the validator script. would have to encode logic for allowing two different types of actions: moving the contract forward (step). or moving the UTXO and hence its value to any other address (unlock). Your off-chain component will need to be able to look at the locked UTXO and decode its datum to see which state the contract is currently in. so that it can correctly generate a transaction for either unlocking the UTXO or driving the contract forward. You can also design contracts that never close. but only ever change state. while still allowing funds to be added and withdrawn from the contract. When you have contracts designed to run in multiple steps. the UTXO that represents the current state of a specific instance/invocation of that script is something you need to be able to keep track of. There is no standard for how to do this as of now. but one way to accomplish this is to be to create a minting-policy that only allows minting of thread token NFTs to the scripts address. and then use the NFTs as thread-tokens by having the validator script enforce such NFTs be moved with each transaction. One of the best known examples of real-world use for this type of smart contract on the Cardano blockchain is Marlowe. For the datum used in transactions validated by the Marlowe validator-script. a custom domain specific language (DSL) was designed to make it easy for end users to create their own financial contracts. The off-chain component takes care of creating transactions that include the contract DSL in the transaction together with the current state. while the validator makes sure that all state transitions are valid according to the custom Marlowe logic. The redeemer sent as part of the state transition transactions contain the input to script.',\n",
       " ' it specifies what is being applied to the old state in order to create the new state: the datum in the output transaction. The script can apply the input to the old datum locally and see if the result matches that of the output UTXO being created in the transaction currently being evaluated. Facilitating the actual use of Marlowe also required creating multiple APIs. chain indexers and frontends for interacting with such contracts. Of course not all contracts are as complex. requiring the same amount of infrastructure around them. but it is worth noting that the off-chain components are just as important as the on-chain parts. Cardano introduced smart contracts in 2021 and now supports the development and deployment of smart contracts using multiple different languages. Writing well-designed smart contracts requires you to have a solid understanding of how Cardano works in general. make sure that everything on this page makes sense before you start creating contracts. Many topics are described in more detail on the Technical Concepts page as well.Cardano has been meticulously designed to ensure sustainability and longevity. A cornerstone of this vision is its self-sufficient governance and funding model. which eliminates the need for external funding. At the heart of Cardanos innovative approach is an on-chain treasury system. consistently funded each epoch by a fixed percentage of the virtual pot. which encompasses all transaction fees collected within that epoch and the ada allocated from the reserve. with the reserves ada allocation determined by the monetary expansion rate. These mechanisms are pivotal for the platforms ongoing development. They are detailed in discussions with Bingsheng Zhang. providing valuable insights into the treasurys operations. Cardano is embarking on a transformative journey towards decentralized governance with the introduction of CIP-1694. marking the onset of the Voltaire era. This proposal establishes a governance framework comprising three roles: the already established group of Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and two novel roles consisting of a Constitutional Committee (CC) and Delegated Representatives (DReps). Community participation is at the core of this governance model. allowing every ada holder to engage in the decision-making process directly. Through CIP-1694. the governance model evolves to encourage a more inclusive and community-driven approach. reflecting Cardanos commitment to sustainable growth and innovation. Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) and Cardano Problem Statements (CPSs) are essential to the ecosystems evolution. facilitating structured innovation and addressing challenges within the network. CIPs serve as a formal process for proposing enhancements or standards for the Cardano protocol. offering a clear pathway for community engagement and technical refinement. Anybody willing to do the work can introduce ideas. which are then collaboratively refined through community input and with the help of the CIP editors. ensuring proposals are robust and beneficial before implementation. The CPS process. outlined in CIP-9999. complements this by focusing on identifying and articulating specific issues or areas for improvement within Cardano. allowing for a targeted approach to problem-solving. CIPs and CPSs reflect Cardanos dedication to continuous development and community-driven standards. ensuring adaptability and responsiveness to user needs.',\n",
       " ' For fuller details about the CIP & CPS processes for authorship. review and editing — including history. ethos. and the roles played by different participants — see the Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) Wiki. Project Catalyst is described as the world\\\\s largest decentralized innovation engine. aimed at solving real-world challenges through community-driven proposals within the Cardano ecosystem. Members of the Cardano community propose. evaluate. and vote on projects across technical. business. creative. and community domains. It emphasizes the power of collective action. inviting participation from anyone. regardless of their background or location. The initiative has supported many proposals and engaged a vast community. highlighting its impact and the extensive opportunities for involvement\\\\u200b.Cardano is advancing towards a decentralized governance model designed to empower community participation and ensure robust decision-making processes. This model is detailed in CIP-1694. which outlines a framework for governance through a tricameral model and a structured decision-making process via seven different types of governance actions. A governance action is a transaction-triggered on-chain event with a time-limited window for execution. Ada holders are at the core of Cardano’s governance. wielding critical voting power and the ability to shape the blockchains future:. Their active involvement ensures that governance remains decentralized and aligned with the interests of the broader community. Each associated stake key can issue two types of delegation certificates. one for a delegation to a stake pool and the other for a delegation to a DRep. DReps will serve as officials representing Ada holders in the governance system. Every ada holder has the choice to either register themselves as a DRep to represent themselves or others or delegate their voting power to a DRep of their choice. Their primary roles include:. SPOs are fundamental to the networks operational integrity and will also play a crucial role in governance by:. The Constitutional Committee will oversee and guide the governance process to adhere to Cardano’s foundational governance principles as defined in the Cardano Constitution. It will:. During the bootstrapping phase. which we will enter right after the Chang hard fork. an Interim Constitutional Committee will be established to:. The interim Constitutional Committee will have the power to change protocol parameters and. together with SPOs. initiate hard forks. The governance process will involve:. In July 2023. a public Cardano testnet named SanchoNet was announced to test all the governance features described in CIP-1694. the teams at IOG have introduced new governance features. enabling the Cardano community to gradually familiarize themselves with the novel system. SanchoNet is accessible to everyone. allowing anyone to join and test the new governance features. Additional documentation about SanchoNet is available at https://sancho. network/.CIP-1694 introduces a comprehensive on-chain governance model for Cardano. aimed at decentralizing and democratizing decision-making within the ecosystem. This proposal describes various types of governance actions. the voting thresholds required for their ratification. and the roles of different participants in the process. The governance model described in CIP-1694 involves three primary roles:. The table below outlines the voting thresholds and which roles participate in each type of governance action:.',\n",
       " ' Relevant Threshold Protocol Parameters:. Apart from Treasury withdrawals and Info actions. a mechanism is in place to ensure that governance actions of the same type do not accidentally clash. Each governance action must include the governance action ID for the most recently enacted action of its type. This ensures that two actions of the same type can only be enacted simultaneously if they are designed to do so deliberately. Actions ratified during the current epoch are prioritized for enactment as follows:. Note: Enactment for Info actions is a null action since they do not have any effect on the protocol. Governance actions are enacted in the order of their acceptance to the chain. Governance actions are checked for ratification only at the epoch boundary. All submitted governance actions will either:. Deposits are returned immediately upon ratification or expiration. All governance actions are enacted at the epoch boundary following their ratification. Each governance action will include the following:. Each action will include elements specific to its type:. Note: The new major protocol version must be exactly one greater than the current version. No duplicate committee members are allowed; each credential pair must be unique. Each accepted governance action will be assigned a unique identifier (governance action ID).Visit the official Project Catalyst website for a comprehensive overview of the services and solutions provided by the worlds largest decentralized innovation engine for solving real-world challenges.

You may even set one up without any prior Linux experience or concern for best practices. Simply copy and paste the commands from the instructions into your shell. simply getting your node up and running is insufficient. You must be able to manage. and safeguard it. you must first comprehend what you are doing in one of the testnets. Consider this category an entry point into the Cardano Pool Operator Community. If you dont meet all of the qualifications. youll need a strong desire to study and the understanding that you wont be able to learn everything in a few weeks. We observed people who had no prior knowledge of Linux. shells. or networking. but who were committed and had enough time to properly deal with it. and who now manage a profitable stake pool. It isnt for everyone. and it isnt going to be simple. Here are a few resources to get you started:. Best practices should always be a key consideration when running a stake pool. Security isnt something you can turn on or off or change in a configuration file. It is both an attitude and a way of life. therefore consider following the security related topics with stake pool operators on the Cardano Forum. Make sure to fully understand Cardano Key Pairs in the basic category. The basic category starts with an introduction to Cardano. you will learn the relay and block producer topology. what the hardware requirements are. which keys are available. which are hot and sensitive. and which you should never save on a server. no matter how convenient it is.We wanted to build a developer portal as open and inclusive as Cardano. If you want to install the portal on your local machine. you can jump directly to the installation instructions. Build your reputation:  Contributions to the developer portal will give your GitHub name and profile higher visibility as more and more people come across your work online.',\n",
       " ' As visibility increases. so too will the reputation of your name and brand. Build your confidence: Creating tutorials and showing fellow community members how to create will not only elevate your knowledge of your own skills and processes. but will also bestow you with greater confidence in your abilities as you interact with others. As an added bonus. since everything is public. people typically pay greater attention to how well something is written or programmed. This will also afford you with an invaluable set of eyes on your contributions that will serve as a crucial peer-reviewed tool to catch errors and refine your work. Build your resume: Each contribution you make acts as a precious notch on your belt towards career development or job searches within the Cardano ecosystem. It is also a way for people to find examples of your work and verify your abilities. By contributing to open source projects. you will not only gain a lot of valuable experience. but if your profile (or brand) reaches a certain level of attention and recognition. you are also more likely to get professional opportunities further down the line. Often underestimated: spread the word. For example: if someone asks you for Cardano wallets. link to the wallet showcase if they want to know about Cardano block explorers. link to the block explorer showcase. Creating an issue is the first step to improving the portal. You dont even have to do the improvement yourself. You can think of it as creating a topic in a forum. An issue can be anything from a simple suggestion to a fully elaborated plan with many sub-items and tasks to check off. You can also open an issue to discuss things. Like a public task manager. people can assign tasks to themselves. Create an issue now. If creating an issue in GitHub is too much for you please consider opening a topic on the Cardano Forum with a title like Developer Portal Suggestion: your suggestion. Fix typos and improve texts. especially if you are a native speaker and have strong writing skills. If you are a talented graphic designer. you can improve various charts and diagrams. We should always use graphics that work well in both light mode and dark mode for the portal. You can also make one graphic for each. If you think something is wrong or something fundamental should change. discussions are the appropriate start to find consensus. There are always ongoing discussions on how to handle or improve something. Please take part in them. Even if you are not a developer. your views are valuable:. Help to add good projects to the showcase section. Please note the guidelines for adding new projects:. Mainly the project showcase should be a place where someone new to the ecosystem can come to see what can be done. For example we agreed that projects have to have a running product today on Cardano mainnet. no promises. no pre-sales. no coming soon pages. We also dont aim to map out a future ecosystem.',\n",

Please note the guidelines for adding new builder tools:. A builder tool is a software application or platform that enables users to create. or other digital products on Cardano. Adding tools to the builder tools section will require creating a pull request. Documentation can constantly be improved. and there are gaps in the developer portal. the stake pool operator section needs a lot of work. To create and improve documentation. you should install the portal on your local machine. Apart from documentation. tutorials are an excellent way to explain things. If you already have a website with tutorials. consider moving them to the Developer Portal. A pull request is a proposal to change something on the developer portal. It can be a small change like fixing a typo or a complete category with hundreds of new files. Pull requests must be reviewed. If you have an excellent technical understanding and mistakes catch your eye. you can review pull requests. You should have made contributions before please read here for more details. Pull requests must be approved by three reviewers to be merged. They are always merged into the staging branch. https://staging-dev-portal. netlify. app reflects the state of the current staging branch.

Scratch this. You can even link to the Forum!. #Level 1 headings are rendered automatically from the title property of your frontmatter. Therefore use ## Level 2 headings as the top most heading in the docs. As a rule. it is useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start rows with a # to create headings. Several ## in a row indicate smaller heading sizes. You can use up to ###### six for different heading sizes. Im an inline-style link. Im an inline-style link with title. Im a reference-style link. You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions. Or leave it empty and use the link text itself.

IOHK works with the worlds leading scholars in basic research. most of which are the object of academic assessment. with articles presented at the highest international conferences. The work on all the main components and functional areas starts with such research to determine what is possible and the best way to accomplish it. Coordinate with the research team. a group of technical trials to test the functions and approaches described in the research. The goal is to turn what theoretically can really be done while learning lessons on function and technical implementation issues in the real world. allowing creating technical parameters to build practical products.

September 12. How will the success of applications in the ecosystem affect the value of Cardano?. September 2.February 7. On February 2. Charles Hoskinson - founder of Cardano - held a AMA (Ask Me Anything) session directly from Colorado. sharing many important information about Cardano. Blockchain Administration. DEFI financial management (DEFI) and challenges in Wyoming state. Here are the remarkable points from the AMA. February is an important time with many plans and events taking place. Hoskinson emphasized that this is the beginning of many major activities of Cardano. from the constitutional discussions. development roadmaps. to budget and administration. Cardano now has a complete On-Chain management system. helping the community to participate in important decisions. The three main issues to be solved are:. With the participation of many parties. Cardano is promoting democratization process in blockchain management and development. An interesting idea proposed is to use smart contracts to manage the budget. This helps to transparent the spending process. allowing suppliers to choose to pay with ADA or Stablecoin on Cardano. Smart contracts can also automatically refund unused balance. Cardano is studying many improvements. Cardano is also considering the integration of Stablecoin and developing DEFI solutions to attract more liquidity into the ecosystem. Hoskinson has criticized Wyomings deployment of Stablecoin in a transparent manner. He said that the process of choosing an unfair platform. when Cardano and many other blockchains were removed without a clear reason. He is also concerned about the inefficient financial management of this project. To cope. he established Integrity Pac - an organization to promote transparency in the bidding and management process at Wyoming. Hoskinson also expressed his views on the US political situation. including the voting of the president and important economic decisions.',\n",
       " ' He emphasized the importance of transparent management and how Blockchain technology can play a role in improving the financial and political system. Although the project in Ethiopia face many challenges. Cardano is committed to expanding operations in Africa through microfinance projects. A subsidiary of Cardano was established in Kenya to promote the blockchain application into finance and commerce in this area. This AMA session not only updated Cardanos development process. but also emphasized important issues in blockchain and decentralized financial management. Hoskinson reaffirmed his commitment to Cardano. as well as the transparency and responsibility in the Blockchain ecosystem. The source of the article here.February 5. In the current Blockchain world. the concept of real world assets (RWAS) is becoming increasingly important and attracting great attention. Technological advances in Blockchain are opening up new capabilities in managing and trading these assets. especially through platforms like Palmyra and Midnight. This article summarizes the video of the interview with Charles Hoskinson that will analyze in detail how Blockchain. especially through these technologies. can change the way the real world assets operate. Blockchain provides a powerful tool to create a Audit Trail. where all activities can be recorded and monitored in a transparent manner. This is not only applied in contract performance but also helps manage the rights and obligations of assets. this technology allows transactions and contracts to live in a single field. where they can be monitored and adjusted as needed. Midnight. a platform built on Blockchain. adds a identifying factor and privacy to transactions. while expanding the ability to interact with different ecosystems. such as Bitcoin. Thanks to improvements like Midgard and Leis. Cardano is gradually becoming an ecosystem that can handle greater trading volume in the near future. One of the highlights in the application of blockchain in real world assets is the ability to combine blockchain platforms and different ledger systems. Midnight is a tool that allows the integration of different blockchain ecosystems. including Cardano and Ergo. This brings flexibility in choosing infrastructure to suit the needs of each property. such as gold or real estate token. The real world assets have a big difference in the way of transactions and management. such as gold is an easy -to -divide and transaction property. while real estate has more complex requirements such as land ownership. water resources and other legal factors. Blockchainization of these assets helps minimize costs and enhance large -scale trading capabilities. while protecting the privacy of participants. One of the important factors in managing real world assets is the choice of how to represent assets to suit its nature and requirements. assets such as gold may be standardized and transacted according to standard contract forms. while real estate requires highly customized contract samples and must comply with specific legal regulations. When using Blockchain. users can create smart contracts (Smart Contracts) to adjust factors such as transactions. warranty conditions. refund policies and other conditions related to property transactions. Blockchain is not only a transaction support tool but also helps to coordinate contract conditions automatically and transparently.',\n",
       " ' One of the interesting examples of Blockchain application is the use of property like real estate to borrow capital. Instead of selling assets. users may mortgage their assets (for example. land or agricultural products) to borrow money without having to give up the ownership of that property. Property token helps open opportunities for valuable property owners but do not have enough liquidity to participate in financial markets. Blockchain also helps reduce transaction costs. especially when applied in emerging markets. where many people cannot access traditional financial products. The use of agricultural products or natural resources as collateral or insurance will help create financial opportunities for low -income people. helping them to access capital without having to suffer great binding from banks or financial institutions. Blockchain offers the ability to reduce transaction costs and expand the market. especially in the areas where traditional transaction costs are very high. Participants can use physical assets such as agricultural products. natural resources or real estate to participate in financial transactions without having to give up their assets. Future financial products will become more and more flexible and easier to access. while creating new opportunities for low -income people or developing areas. Blockchain will help create a widely shared economy. in which everyone can participate and benefit from the economic opportunities that this technology brings. The real world assets (RWAs) are becoming more and more focused in blockchain discussions and financial technology. Palmyra and Midnight are two important platforms in converting these assets into financial instruments that can trade easier and more transparent. The development of blockchain technology and platforms like Midnight will continue to promote innovation in the field of finance. creating new opportunities for individuals and businesses around the globe. Sebastien. founder of Time S Studios at DC Spark. introduced the two potential blockchain projects he was working: Mina and Midnight. Both are Zero-Knowledge Cryptography (Zero-Knowledge) projects-an advanced encryption technology that helps ensure privacy and expansion ability in the blockchain. Despite the same platform. Zero-Knowledge and Recursive Snark. these two projects have different approaches in the implementation and use of technology. This podcast will summarize Sebastiens discussion explanation of important concepts and compare the operation of Mina and Midnight in the field of Blockchain. Zero-Knowledge Cryptography is an encryption technique that helps verify information without disclosing specific content. This has two main applications in Blockchain:. Sebastien illustrates this concept through the game  Where’s Waldo?  (Where to see Waldo?). Suppose you have found Waldo on a detailed map. If you want to prove to your friends that you know the position of Waldo without revealing the entire map. you can cover the entire page and only cut a small hole at the standing place. This helps:. This approach is very important in the Blockchain. especially when building Zero-Knowledge-Rollup-Layer 2 Expansion Solutions using Zero-Knowledge to optimize archives and transaction processing. Recursive Snark is a technique that helps to combine many proving Zero-Knowledge into a single evidence of unchanged size. This means:. Back to the example  Where’s Waldo? .',\n",
       " ' Instead of just looking for a Waldo on one page. you can have many books Where’s Waldo? And need to prove that you have found Waldo on all pages. Recursive Snark gives you only one evidence for the entire book. instead of creating many individually proofs. Both Mina and Midnight use Zero-Knowledge and Recursive Snark. but there is an important difference in the way of deployment. Zero-Knowledge can be applied in many different fields in the blockchain. Sebastien emphasized that Zero-Knowledge is not only a trend. but will become a standard in the blockchain industry. As privacy and expansion problems are increasingly important. Zero-Knowledge blockchains supports Mina and Midnight will play a key role in the global Blockchain ecosystem. Both Mina and Midnight are pioneering projects in the application of Zero-Knowledge Cryptography (Zero-Knowledge) and Recursive Snark. While Mina focuses on the ability to expand with light blockchain. Midnight aims to protect privacy and user data. Zero-Knowledge technology will continue to grow and become an important foundation for the next generation of Blockchain. helping to improve the ability to expand. protect privacy and create more practical applications in the digital world. Catalyst is an important initiative of Cardano ecosystem to allocate resources and support community projects. In the 2025 roadmap. Catalyst continued to develop with new funding funds. improving technology and management strategies to ensure transparency. efficiency and sustainability. Here are important highlights in the Catalyst 2025 plan. Catalyst aims to support 500 to 700 projects each. through three consecutive funds: Fund 14. Fund 15 and Fund 16. This is to maintain continuous funding in the context of the fund allocation system from Cardano fund is still in the process of finishing. Catalyst will implement improvements such as:. Catalyst is expected to deploy Retroactive Public Goods Funds (RetropGF) with a budget of 5 million ADA. Catalyst will work closely with InterSect - Cardanos administration organization - to:. Catalyst 2025 marked an important step in Cardanos development. with specific goals:. ✅ Support 500-700 projects per sponsorship round. ✅ Retroactive Public Goods Funds application. rewarding projects with practical impacts. ✅ Launching a new catalyst. helping to experience the user smoother. ✅ Upgrade the voting mechanism. enhance fairness and transparency. ✅ Expanding cooperation with large businesses. promoting Cardanos practical application. Catalysts initiative not only helps to expand the Cardano ecosystem but also affirms the position of this blockchain in the field of decentralized finance and community management. it will be an important year. determining the success of the long -term strategies that Catalyst and Cardano are aiming for.January 14. The initial blockchain has a public ledger to build user trust through data verification. the verification public is contrary to privacy. it is essential to find reliable solutions to help balance the ability to verify and privacy. a partnerchain of Cardano. aims to achieve this balance. Blockchain technology has gained the trust of users largely thanks to the exact ability to verify the amount of money in circulation and all transactions are recorded in blocks.',\n",
       " ' Users do not need to rely on third party to make main claims about the protocols properties and status. Because the source code of blockchain is openly open source. users can review the rules and verify that the protocol works as required to be public. They can also run a workstation app. connect to the network and play back all processed transactions. Users do not need to trust. they can verify. The ability to verify data is important in building trust in decentralized networks. this verification is contrary to privacy. Blockchain transactions are financially because the property is transferred to the market price. These transactions disclose information about the sender and the recipient to be kept confidential. if Alice sends the property from her address to the Bobs address. Alice can view information about Bobs wallet. including transactions and vice versa. The whole world can also see this transaction. Alice and Bob may be friends. but their relationship may vary. such as buyers and cashiers. suppliers and customers. or citizens and officials. Although conventional blockchain transactions do not bring user information directly. the real identity with the wallet is common due to legal requirements and KYC pressure when using the exchange or other financial services. Blockchain books openly provide very little privacy. When someone sends the transaction. they will reveal a part of their privacy. at least to the recipient. Privacy series solve the issue of the public ledger by using many different techniques to hide the address of both the sender and the recipient. as well as the amount of assets transferred. Although these strings effectively protect users sensitive data. they often do not allow the selective disclosure to certain data for a limited number of participants. This makes it difficult to prove that transactions are not abused for illegal activities. the authorities ordered to cancel such projects from the exchanges. leading to loss of liquidity and reducing the attention of ordinary users who do not prioritize privacy. The balance of privacy and verification is very important for ordinary users. businesses and governments to apply Blockchain more widely. Users are more likely to use blockchain services if their privacy is protected. besides other essential features such as low fees. security and expansion capacity. it is important to verify the main aspects of Blockchain. such as the amount of money circulating and their release schedule. Although the monetary policy of the project must be publicly verified. individual transactions must still be protected. For businesses and governments. the protection of sensitive information and user data is both essential and legal requirements. Modern financial services need to maintain the users privacy and allows the authorities to verify certain transaction details. with different requirements between legal areas. The government must ensure that citizens pay taxes and not participate in illegal activities if they want to allow DEFI service. Be realistic. The need to monitor government financial transactions will not disappear because of Blockchain. Although we may want governments to adapt to Blockchain rather than the opposite.',\n",
       " ' A modern blockchain like Midnight must provide many cases of use may have many different privacy requirements. The completely private chains have been listed from the trading floors. limiting their mass potential. Midnight focuses on privacy. It allows to create users protection services and allows you to disclose selective data for specific observers when needed. Midnight developers can use Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). a technology that allows verification of on-chain data reports without disclosing basic information. Midnight can be described as a smart contract platform that provides privacy as an additional benefit. It allows to create applications and exploit assets. Midnight provides developers with programmable data protection. allowing them to integrate business policies. such as preserving user data to comply with the rules. into their applications. Cardano is currently operating with a public ledger and this is difficult to change in the near future. The simplest way to achieve higher privacy is through 2 or partnerchain solutions like Midnight. Midnight aims to become a security partner not only for Cardano but also for the entire crypto industry. This is an ambitious goal. but overcoming such ambitious goals is essential for blockchain technology to be widely used. the balance between privacy and verification ability will change flexibly as needed. Although verification is very important to achieve the trust of those who accept early. I believe that when the acceptance rate increases. privacy will be more focused.November 15. On October 13. Input Output introduced Ouroboros Peras. an upgrade of Ouroboros Praos. in order to solve the problem of the transaction time. which is the time needed for a fully confirmed transaction without any risks. So what is Ouroboros? This is really the first secure proof protocol that is proven to be safe and the first blockchain protocol was built based on scientific research. It combines advanced technology and mechanisms that have been verified with deep understanding of behavioral psychology and economic philosophy to ensure that the blockchains based on it are safe and sustainable. Result? A protocol that ensures security and allows networks that do not need to be allowed to be globally allowed to use minimum energy. Cardano was the first to deploy this feature. The core of Ouroboros is the idea of \\\\u200b\\\\u200bendlessness. emphasizing the needs of developing the global network in a sustainable and ethical manner. creating more opportunities and preserving resources. Ouroboros encourages the creation of distributed networks. no need to be allowed to be able to sustainable support for new markets. making the market safer. can expand and save energy than previous solutions. Ouroboros processes transactions by dividing the string into epoch and then time slots. with the head of the slot selected for each slot to add a new block. To prevent manipulation. these new slot leaders consider recent blocks to be temporary. meaning that only a series of temporary blocks is considered to be completed. This method. called the payment delay. helps keep the ledger safely between the participants. By combining advanced technology with philosophical insights.',\n",
       " ' Ouroboros discovers how society behaves to achieve balance. guided by the theory of game. between personal and collective interests. Its encouragement system rewards honestly and prevents dishonesty. solid and sustainable platform for long -term permitted networks. considered as the infrastructure of the future. Ouroboros Praos is an article published in April 2023 by Bernardo David. Peter Gazi. Aggelos Kiayias and Alexander Russell. It introduces a breakthrough blockchain blockchain to protect against adaptive attacks completely in the semi -synchronous environment. This means that the attackers can target any participants of the stakeholders who have always changed at any time. as long as the majority of them are still honest. This protocol also resolves situations in which an attacker can delay sending messages that participants do not know how long they will have to wait. To achieve this high level of security. the authors have developed a unique safe digital signature and a random function that can be verified but still unpredictable. even when the lock is created in an unsafe way. Their security evidence uses a comprehensive framework to analyze semi -synchronous blockchain. which can be valid in its true sense. PraOS proves that this protocol is safe based on the standards of standard cryptography in the random Oracle model. As an upgrade of Ouroboros Classic. Praos enhances both security and expansion. While both versions organize transactions into slot chains that are grouped into epoch. Praos operating in a semi -synchronous way. helping to protect more effectively before adaptive attackers. PraOS resolves two main threats: a threat that the opponent can delay messages from honest participants in addition to a single slot and another threat is that they can send arbitrary messages to participants at any time. To combat these threats. PraOS uses a separate head and a locking signature. which helps to improve the random and makes it difficult for the attacker to predict the next slot head. This unpredictable property is important to prevent intentional attacks. such as DDOS (refusing dispersed services). PraOS is designed to handle delays in sending messages and gradual errors of participants over time. This flexibility is essential to maintain global network security. as long as most Stake is still honest. Ouroboros Peras is an upgrade of the Ouroboros Praos protocol. adding a voting layer to speed up the completion of the transaction. This new protocol is designed for adaptive security. allowing dynamic participation and self -recovery features. The voting system brings the push to the blocks with sufficient votes. which really reduces the possibility of those blocks and their predecessors are canceled. It can be resolved quickly even if the opponent holds up to 1/4 of the stake and it will keep that safety if the opponent controls more than that. If the attacker blocks the number of voting delegates. the protocol will turn to cooling down and acts very similar to PraOS. This period lasts until the chain heals and reaches good quality. normal state. With appropriate settings. blocks can usually be marked as resolved or at risk of being restored after only two minutes.',\n",
       " ' This quick settlement feature is very useful for things like Partnerchain and Bridge. in which quick confirmation of the transaction state is important. To deploy this protocol. you need to have a layer of dispersion of votes. evidence to collect votes and a small editing for block content. although Hydra helps to quickly process transactions in grade 2. it and Mithril have not completely solved the issues of catheterization and delay on the Cardano main network. To overcome these problems. they developed new versions of the Ouroboros protocol: Peras and Leios. Peras focuses on speeding up the transaction payment. ensuring they are recorded and completed faster. while Leios focuses on the best use of available network bandwidth. these protocols are established to seriously improve the user experience by allowing many transactions to be processed and resolved quickly on the Blockchain. finally improving the efficiency and performance on the Cardano main network. The main idea behind Ouroboros Peras is to make the PraOS protocol even better by adding a way for Stake Pool operator (SPO) to show their support to the blocks right after the latest block in their favorite chain. This voting process increases the weight of the string. with the basic weight that comes from its blocks. After that. participants will choose the heaviest chain they like best. When everything works smoothly. such as when the network works well and the rate of corruption is low. most votes tend to focus on a single block. which will increase the weight of any string including that block. for Peras to operate safely. it is important to have enough consensus mechanisms in each voting round. This means that a block needs to receive more votes more than a certain threshold. called delegates. This threshold is established to refer to a block that can reach the number of delegates. ensuring a clear voting distance between that block and any other block. If the number of delegates is not reached. there is no guarantee of the voting distance. this can cause the attacker to disturb the voting process and divide the participants honestly. If the voting round does not meet the sufficient number of delegates. Peras will move to the cooldown when the voting is paused and basically acts like a praos during that time. This cooldown must be long enough to balance all advantages that the attacker can receive from the voting round. There is a bit of balance between the benefits of voting and prolonged cooldown: the greater the voting increase. the more potential damage can come from a bigger. the greater the failure. which means to wait longer before voting can start again. In practical use. Cardano network has shown that it is really effective and durable. even when encountering physical problems. Almost all authorized shares are often online and have not had a major attack on Praos since the Shelley period. showing that most Spo follows the protocol. If these good conditions are maintained. Peras may continue to perform quick processing phases without cooldown.',\n",
       " ' Ouroboros Praos and its upgrade. Ouroboros Peras. showing significant progress in Blockchain technology. especially for Cardano. By solving an important issue on the time of completing transactions. Peras enhances the security and effectiveness of the PraOS protocol and introduces the intelligent voting mechanism to empower the Stake Pool operator. This allows to confirm the transaction faster and more reliable. even in ideal conditions. When Cardano continues to prove the ability to recover and high performance. the integration of these protocols promises to improve the user experience by allowing faster processing and completing transactions. Ouroboros continuous development reflects the commitment to create a safe. sustainable and effective Blockchain ecosystem that can support the future of decentralized networks.November 3. On November 2. Cardano founder. made a Supprise AMA. shared his thoughts on the future of Cardano ecosystem. along with personal views on financial and political issues that are influencing the Blockchain world. The discussion revolves around big topics: budget management. cooperation model with Bitcoin. the potential of Blockchain in Argentina. and the challenges that Cardano will face for sustainable development. Charles Hoskinson started the AMA with profound comments on the budget issue in large projects of Cardano. especially the difficulties due to monthly payment requirements. Hoskinson emphasized that ensuring long -term financial resources is a vital factor to maintain and develop the cardano project. He warned that if only paid by month. Cardano will have difficulty attracting top talents or prestigious partners in the project. A prominent example is a commitment to sponsor $ 4. 5 million in three years for research laboratory at Stanford University to serve research and development for Cardano. According to Hoskinson. such long -term commitments are necessary to ensure the continuity of new research and development. Without long -term sponsorship plans. these commitments can hardly come true. He also pointed out that an unstable environment. with decisions that change by month. will make partners capable of refusing cooperation for lack of financial trust. thereby weakening Cardanos development ability. Hoskinson warned that allowing the community to change the budget or stop sponsoring some individuals can lead to polarization. causing internal struggles. He compares this to government projects in the US. such as NASA. where the budget is often changed depending on the policies and views of each government. This affects long -term plans and the ability to complete large projects. Hoskinson explained that the Cardano budget management needs a clear monitoring and evaluation mechanism. but it should not be a monthly intervention too detailed in each expenditure. He proposed a financial system with annual budget and periodic financial statements. allowing supervision without hindering the operations of participating units. This will help maintain the quality and work progress while ensuring the transparency of the community. Hoskinson offers the prospect that if the financial management is too detailed monthly. all expenses. from air tickets to working costs. can be controversial by the community and affect the activities of development groups. He believes that a reasonable financial monitoring model and not too interfered in details will create conditions to attract talented developers.',\n",
       " ' ensuring the progress of long -term projects. One of the most notable information from AMA is about the cooperation between Cardano and Bitcoin OS. opening up the ability to create a Trustless Bridge between two blockchains. Hoskinson shared a vision that allows Bitcoin users to interact with decentralized applications (DApps) on Cardano and can still pay for Bitcoin transaction fees. If successful. this will be a breakthrough. as Cardano can attract a large liquidity line from the Bitcoin market. with the current value of about 1. 3 trillion USD. This cooperation not only promotes compatibility and variety of applications on Cardano. but also helps Cardano become a useful foundation for Bitcoin users. Hoskinson added that Cardano will conduct research on Zero-Knowledge evidence (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) and test with Bitcoin OS to ensure security when converting assets between two chains. This project is expected to be a revolution in expanding Cardano utilities. while creating the ability for Bitcoin investors to participate in Cardano DAPPS while retaining Bitcoins confidentiality and decentralization. Hoskinson also discussed opportunities and challenges when deploying blockchain in Argentina. a complex political country. With the new government of President Javier Milei. he said that Argentina needs a specific and long -term plan to bring blockchain technology to the government and promote digital reform. Hoskinson proposed that Argentina should develop a development plan to 2030. which includes Blockchain. artificial intelligence and other digital technologies to create a sustainable foundation for the future. One of Hoskinsons goals is to establish a platform for a public-private blockchain ecosystem in Argentina. which connects the public sector and individual businesses in building blockchain-based public services. he also acknowledged that it would be difficult to balance the public and personal sector in a government of free thoughts like Mileis. because there were many controversy surrounding the role of state and personal area. Hoskinson hopes that local businesses and blockchain companies can cooperate to bring blockchain into Argentina. in order to enhance transparency. efficiency and security for public services. He also shared that Cardano. with open structure and ability to support Bitcoin through cooperative projects. is a platform in accordance with Mileis free philosophy. while Bitcoin can be used as an additional financial instrument for the nation. During the AMA. Hoskinson was not afraid to share his views on the current political situation in the US. especially concerns about privacy and personal rights. He took the example of the case of a squirrel farmer in New York who was confiscated by the government on the grounds of protecting animal rights. but then the squirrel was killed. Hoskinson thinks that the overexposed governments intervention in personal life is a sign of the decline in personal freedom. and that is why many Americans feel frustrated and indignant. He also expressed concern about deep political polarization in the US and predicted that this situation would lead to instability without changes. According to him. the United States is being divided into two completely different realities. where one side agrees with all current government policies.',\n",
       " ' while the other side criticizes all moves of the government. Although there is no intention of participating in politics. Hoskinson believes that Blockchain may be a solution to enhance transparency and fairness in the public management system. Hoskinson provides updated information about Midnight - a special security layer on Cardano. He revealed that the Midnight project is progressing well with a clear roadmap and strategic partners have participated. Midnight will be a Layer-2 platform for high security for decentralized applications. allowing developers to build advanced and expandable security solutions. Hoskinson also emphasized that Midnight will help expand the Cardano ecosystem. while serving more practical use needs for users. This project also aims to connect with many other blockchains. and he believes this will open up the vast interaction between Cardano and other Blockchain ecosystems. Through the AMA. as the founder of Cardano. brought a deep and dedicated look at the current situation and the future of Cardano ecosystem. His shares not only reflect the challenges in building a sustainable blockchain platform. but also showed his commitment to promoting blockchain technology and protecting the core values. Cardanos future will depend on the resolution of budget problems. cooperation and community development to continue to be a leading blockchain platform globally. Source.October 31. Cardano is aiming to handle 1 million transactions per second (TPS) with advanced technologies like Ouroboros Leios. Peras and Hydra. creating a blockchain platform that can compete with high -speed systems like Solana. Ouroboros Leios:. OUROBOROS PARAS:. Hydra:. Cardano is aiming at 1 million TPS. this figure needs a synchronous development and integration from Leios. Peras. Hydra. and Sidechain. The achievement of this number can take many years. with important milestones:. Cardano with new solutions will be able to compete with high -speed blockchain like Solana. providing flexible and security platforms. while maintaining decentralization. Cardano will not only improve the transaction speed but also open up opportunities for an expanded Blockchain ecosystem. attracting many users and developers. Thanks to Leios. and Hydra. Cardano is demonstrating the sustainable development ability. towards the goal of solving the problem of Blockchain expansion without reducing the systems security and decentralization. Source:.October 27. Hydra is a Scaling Solution on Cardanos blockchain platform. acting as a Layer 2 solution. allowing transactions at a faster speed and higher flexibility than traditional blockchains. Hydra has been active directly on the main internet (mainnet) and is provided with open source. allowing developers and users to explore and use. Some of the Cardano community misunderstood that Hydra will increase the speed of all transactions to millions or even billions of transactions per second (TPS). The truth is. Hydra does not work directly on Stake Pool (Stake Pool) to speed up. but instead acts as an independent solution in Layer 2 to expand the network processing ability of the network. Hydra is now ready to use and is not a plan for the far future. It acts as a state channel. allowing Cardano network expansion to meet the higher processing needs.',\n",
       " ' According to initial studies. each Hydra head can handle about 1.000 transactions per second. A special feature of Hydra is the ability to expand horizontally (Horizontal Scaling). that is. we can open Hydra Head in parallel. Suppose can run in parallel with 1.000 hydra head . Cardano can achieve a speed of up to one million TPS. this number is only theoretical potential because the actual performance of Hydra depends on many factors such as the complexity of the transactions made. in practical tests at the Rare Evo event. Hydra reached about 280 TPS when conducting smart contract transactions. With this expansion mechanism. the cardano system can increase the ability to process transactions without being limited by the number of Hydra head opened in parallel. as long as the application is allowed. Hydra does not make Cardanos Stake Pool faster. but instead. it is a layer 2 solution with higher flexibility than other solutions. The similarity can be seen between Hydra and Lightning Network on Bitcoin. where both are state channel solutions. Hydra can perform more types of transactions. from transfer of assets. Token Cardano to run smart contracts. thanks to the similar ability of the structure as the Cardano layer. unlike traditional Rollup solutions (for example. Optimistic Rollup or Zero-KnowLedge Rollup) are fixed and often exist permanently. Hydra has its own life cycle: Open. perform transactions. and then close. This brings more flexibility to applications that need to change often. Hydra is designed to optimize applications that require zero or very low transaction fees. With the short life cycle of  Hydra Head . Cardano can provide extremely low or zero fees. helping the system easily adapt and update. while reducing the risk of DOS attack. Hydra is one of Cardanos notable steps to bring a flexible blockchain platform. high expansion and retain security criteria. With Hydra. Cardano can better meet the requirements of a global blockchain. helping to handle large and complex trading volume without changing the existing layer structure 1. The breakthrough changes the situation of Crypto. 2024 marked an important milestone when Cardano announced cooperation with Bitcoin OS at the Cardano Conference in Dubai. The event opens a new page for both ecosystems when a bridge allows Bitcoin to access Cardanos smart contract infrastructure and vice versa. Cardano can access a huge $ 1. 3 trillion liquidity of Bitcoin. This not only enhances Cardanos popularity in the Crypto community. but also the foundation for the development of DEFI applications using Bitcoin assets effectively and safely. Bitcoin is the most liquid digital token and the largest accumulated value today. but its applications are mostly limited in valuable storage and transactions. Cardano stands out with the smart contract system on the UTXO platform (Unspent Transaction Output). similar to Bitcoin. but has a higher expansion and programming ability. With this bridge. Bitcoin developers and users can now use Bitcoin as assets in DEFI applications on Cardano. opening the door for loan models. decentralized transactions and even constructing complex financial products that Bitcoin has previously not implemented.',\n",
       " ' According to the CEO of Bitcoin OS. Eden Yago. this connection has the potential to unlock the fortune of about US $ 1. 3 trillion. currently freezing in Bitcoin\\\\s system. for use in decentralized applications. This also helps Cardano significantly increase the total value of the locked asset (TVL). an important factor to develop and attract new users. The highlight of this bridge is the Zero-Knowledge Proofs technology. which allows information authentication without disclosing specific data. Thanks to Zero-Knowledge Proofs. transactions between Cardano and Bitcoin are guaranteed to be safe and transparent. minimizing security risks-one of the biggest risks of blockchain bridges today. According to Cindesk. the Bitcoin OS bridge is one of the first bridges that can be verified for Zero-Knowledge evidence on Bitcoin. helping the property moving between blockchains with higher safety levels that only need an authentic unit in the network. This event has attracted great attention from the Crypto community and digital news pages such as Cindesk and Cointelegraph all widely reported on it. founder of Cardano. affirmed that this was a revolutionary step forward and in accordance with his vision of a true decentralized financial ecosystem. where Bitcoin and Cardano could support each other. there are some mixed opinions. like from Fred Krueger - a maximum Bitcoinist. saying that integrating Bitcoin into Cardano ecosystem is not necessary. many other experts. such as Dan Held. emphasized that the development of decentralized financial applications on Bitcoin will not affect the nature of Bitcoin. it will increase its value through expanding its usability. This cooperation promises to change the situation of both networks. making Bitcoin a decentralized financial asset with higher practical value. For Cardano. getting more liquidity from Bitcoin is not only a great opportunity to develop but also helps increase the attractiveness of developers and investors. recent technology improvements on Cardano such as Plutus V3 upgrade are also improving the compatibility of this platform with EVM wallets. helping to attract more users from other ecosystems. The connection between Bitcoin and Cardano marks an important step for decentralized finance. Thanks to this cooperation. Bitcoin can now take advantage of Cardanos smart contract feature to participate in DEFI applications. creating a new market for investors and users. This is not only a great technical achievement but also opened a new era for the development of Blockchain. bringing both ecosystems to a new level in the global financial field.October 22. Charles Hoskinson has recently met Argentina President Javier Milei to explore how Blockchain technology can transform the global economic and political system. In his speech at the Argentina technology forum. Hoskinson discussed Blockchains future and expressed his belief that Cardano had the potential to surpass both Ethereum and Bitcoin. He shared an ambitious vision that many Bitcoin enthusiasts rejected. not realizing that they had the same goal but approached it in a different way. Instead of arguing whether Cardano grows faster than Bitcoin or not. it will be more effective to grasp big and always open ideas with all possibilities.',\n",
       " ' In his speech. Charles Hoskinson noted that although we have achieved unprecedented productivity. training and communication tools. our quality of life is still declining. It is because the system is broken. Money is no longer valuable. We no longer trust each other as much as before and people do not know what to believe in or where to go. There is a crisis of meaning in life. Charles considered Blockchain as the most important innovation in human history. He mentioned that transnational organizations currently operate badly and cannot prevent war and polarity in society. “It is the most significant and important technology in human history because of the core of Blockchain. what we are trying to do. simply solving one thing. Try to create a world where we can trust each other again. We have the IMF. We have a world bank. We have these transnational agencies and they will all find everything. And then what happened 20 years later. 30 years later? We have stopped trusting each other. We begin to fight against each other and now billions of people are choosing the side. Do we distinguish we are in the BRICS system or are we in the US system? . Charles has solved the problem of the current social system and considered Blockchain as a solution. “The reason why social systems do not have this guarantee is because they have no objective reality. What Blockchain does by restoring belief is that it creates that objective reality for everyone. It creates a consensus mechanism about what happened. where it happened. whose happened to whom. which order it happened. And from there you can start rebuilding the economic and socio -political system. And you can rebuild them in the same way as techniques that people in the world see the same thing. And that is the most valuable progress in human history because this is the first time in human history we are all seen. experienced and trusted in the same thing. He mentioned that if you are not satisfied with the current situation. its time to apply technologies to solve the problem. the change will take decades. “And if you are not satisfied with your token. you are not satisfied with your political system if you are not satisfied with the administration that has been operating in history. if you are skeptical about companies worth trillions of dollars seems to own everything and control everything. maybe just possible. you are looking for new ideas and new systems on the market. And if you happen to be the first to apply that new ideas and systems after 10 years. 20 years. 30 years. then you wake up. you are the next American. You are the next person above. Charles believes that Cardano will be greater than Ethereum and Bitcoin. “For seven years since Cardano launched. we have gone from the number that does not become a 11 -digit network with millions and the largest research team in the world and the passion of young people.',\n",
       " ' And in a decade. we will be greater than Ethereum. we will be greater than Bitcoin. In a decade. most governments in the world will operate our infrastructure because they believe in it. That is what thinks for decades to bring you. thats what you think horizontally to you. the curse of Silicon Valley for everything. My hope for Cardano is that it can inspire the world to remember that lesson. Through decentralized. it never died. Thanks to good management. there is always the best ideas. And with the thinking horizontally from decade to decade. every decade you make progress. And every decade you become better. When the president of a large country met a representative of the Blockchain project. it marked a significant step in the application. The application of Bitcoin in El Salvador is disappointing. as President Nayib Bukele has pointed out. Most Salvador citizens do not use BTC to pay or make valuable storage means and basically it does not change their lives. Since Bitcoin became legal in September 2021. there has been no significant progress in the application of the state -class crypto. President Trumps appearance at a Bitcoin conference may be part of his election effort. Politicians are increasingly arguing about crypto. but their focus is mainly in terms of regulations and taxes. They do not consider Blockchain technology as a solution to current beliefs. like Charles Hoskinson suggested. While some countries have accepted Crypto. their politicians often consider them to be mainly new investment properties without any big plans to take advantage of more technology. New technologies have a profound impact on political systems. the Internet has allowed communication not to be censored at a distance. playing an important role in overthrowing many dictatorships. Infrastructure status in both developed countries and some developing countries depends heavily on the Internet and its services. Emerging technologies such as Blockchain and AI. as President Milei emphasized. will be essential to build or upgrade infrastructure status. Charles Hoskinson has determined the basic reason for this change: loss of faith in the current system. Issues such as unable to prevent corruption effectively. complexity and do not need to rely on the reliability of audits. the inefficiency of eliminating less powerful politicians and the desire to have more effective voting systems. like in Switzerland. promoting this change demand. Blockchain is basically a reliable machine. This is not about Bitcoin compared to Cardano or any other type of crypto; It is taking advantage of this main feature to improve our living conditions. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts mistakenly think that just fixing money will solve our problem. money and political system are closely related; This cannot work effectively without the other. It is unrealistic to think that only BTC can make someone a global citizen or citizen. improving confidence in the political or financial system cannot rely on the old financial system and cash printer. Bitcoin enthusiasts are struggling with the use of BTC while maintaining their citizenship. They often want to change the government in addition to changing the monetary system but have not yet found an effective solution.',\n",
       " ' Ironically. the answer lies right in front of them: Blockchain technology. This reliable machine simply needs to be further developed and thoughtful. Bitcoin is designed to become a new digital gold. but its protocol is not suitable for many other things. As Charles mentioned. the Bitcoin community largely abandoned his concentration. On the other hand. Cardano is doing another approach. It emphasizes gradual and safe innovation for decades. in order to become the backbone of the financial and political system. Cardano prioritizes decentralized. including on-chain management. more expandable. This is very important for any protocol to serve as infrastructure state. regardless of political and neutral influence. the application of BTC as a means of exchange seems unrealistic. The infrastructure status on the blockchain must allow the state to create state money with fixed and immutable rules. The solid token in the future may not be BTC; It may be the BTC used as the collateral for an algorithm stablecoin. Or maybe Ada and many other indigenous coins. Money in the future must be integrated with infrastructure state. If the money is decentralized. the infrastructure status. the voting system and the government must be the same. This does not mean that the state will only be a ritual without politicians or officials. that means a certain number of rules. rules or agreements will exist on Blockchain to ensure their integrity. immutability and history. The control of the system needs to be returned to the people to restore trust. Disappointments to current systems often arise due to lack of tools to make a change. Electing politicians every few years is an incomplete mechanism to control the system. Bitcoin enthusiasts should realize that the quality of life is not only affected by money. Factors such as law enforcement. fair system. fair salary for work. access to new opportunities. freedom. anti -corruption and explanation responsibility all play an important role. Charles speech on Cardano can surpass Bitcoin has caused social debates. with most discussions focusing on market capitalization. the market capitalization does not reflect the true potential of technology in affecting society. If Cardano or any other blockchain becomes the backbone of the Government infrastructure. a tool for transparent voting. citizen control. money -casting status and other assets. its market capitalization will certainly be much higher than today. Whether it exceeds Bitcoins market limit is not relevant; What is really important is the positive change that it brings to society.October 20. The development of decentralized applications has a rich history. these applications were deployed on the smart contract platform. users mainly interact with them through 2nd grade solutions (Layer 2). The next important milestone will be the process of converting to the application chain - applications running on their own dedicated blockchain. In this article. we will discover how the Partnerchain frame is suitable for this emerging trend. Uniswap has announced the development of the new layer network 2 to have a fast blocking time. cross -chain interaction capability. seamless multi -chain swap and decentralized authentication network.',\n",
       " ' Uniswap. originally launched as a decentralized application on Ethereum. is now converted into a specialized chain that focuses on one activity. called the application chain. This trend seems reasonable but brings many new dishes worth thinking. Think about why this evolution is inevitable. Ethereum provided a decentralized enforcement environment for all decentralized applications (DApps). Third -party groups may only need to write smart contracts. such as contracts for decentralized trading floor (DEX) without having to worry about basic infrastructure. Applications running in a single enforcement environment have the advantage of being easily interacted with each other. When making smart contracts for an application. it can interact seamlessly with another smart contract. Ethereums trading process is limited and sequentially sequentially. creating congestion. Each application may require high pine. but all applications have the same resources and enforcement environment. Ethereum can only handle a few dozen transactions per second. which clearly shows that it cannot meet the needs of all successful applications. Another disadvantage is lack of expertise. If a group needs to resolve transactions faster or significantly expand the application for their application. it cannot be achieved without changing Ethereums consensus mechanism. Eventing efforts to enhance Ethereum\\\\s expansion have led to the development of competition blockchains with sharding   sharding strategies or other expansion strategies. These blockchains are still establishing and competing with layer 2 solutions in the Ethereum ecosystem. some users who prefer Blockchain can expand the Layer 2 environment. While many projects begin to build a highly expanded network consent mechanism. the Layer 2 network has appeared. providing their own enforcement environment often originated from the original blockchain. EVM in the case of Ethereum. The Ethereum group even stopped pursuing Sharding . The deployment of applications from layer 1 to layer 2 is very simple and the Layer 2 can expand the scale well due to their concentration. Layer 2 uses layer 1 to provide available data and finally resolved. The disadvantage of layer 2 is not compatible with each other. leading to user competition and liquidity. Although the bridges can minimize this problem to a certain extent. ensuring safe token transfer between networks is still a significant concern. Some groups have deployed the same application on all compatible layers. you can use Uniswap on Arbitrum. Optimism. Polygon. Base and other networks. Ethereum is no longer the only smart contract platform. Ecological systems such as Cardano. Solana. Avalanche. Binance Smart Chain. Polkadot and Cosmos have gained attractive and Uniswap is also available on many of this layer 1 network. Very clear trend: Successful Ethereum applications often seek to expand into other platforms. which may require rewriting applications due to different execution environments. Running with a separate application on different networks can lead to an inefficiency in supply and demand connection. the same application (brand) may have different security assumptions on different networks. Error on a network. such as Layer 2 focused. can also harm the reputation of the brand. although Layer 2 seems to solve the problems of Ethereums ability to expand.',\n",
       " ' they often do so with a decentralized and security cost. Groups with management key kept significantly controlling the users property. Running the same application on different networks does not bring a definitive solution. There are two alternative solutions: Blockchains can expand as high as Solana and projects that have pioneered in the concept of app chain (Appchains) from the beginning. such as Cosmos and Polkadot. Uniswaps decision to build an application chain - a blockchain specializing in token swap on all blockchain - is a strategic step. This approach ensures that the security. decentralization and expansion of Uniswap independently of Ethereum. Or at least. less dependent. The use of Uni token may be necessary to decentralize Uniswap. Appchains can operate independently with their original blockchain in both technology and tokens. A group of application chains can apply the implementation environment of the original blockchain or develop a completely new environment. just like the group can set up their own consensus and ledger. UNISWAP will be able to access the Blockchain industry widely through the development of interactive technologies. The group plans to create a specialized environment for UNISWAP and ensure seamless interaction with other blockchains. This means that users from many different blockchains will be able to use the same application. The union of liquidity and users in an application chain will bring significant advantages. The IOG group is developing the Partnerchain frame. which allows creating partnerchain chains in the Cardano ecosystem. an inspired concept of Polkadot (and cosmos). These apps will work similar to Uniswap. serving users on multiple blockchains. Midnight will be Cardanos first partnerchain. If this trend continues. Layer 2 focuses outdated when groups focus on building an application chain and they will want to attract users as well as liquidity. The Appchains will operate independently of the original blockchain. which will mainly act as a safe class. Users may hold the token on the blockchain instead of the app chain. The exploitation of assets in the real world may occur on blockchains instead of apps. to provide liquidity or token lock. the application chain will be the priority option. Appchains will compete with both Layer 2 blockchain and high TPS. often sacrificing decentralized. The network effect is expected to develop in places with the largest utility. this utility will be available on apps instead of on blockchain. becoming part of the Blockchain or Layer 2 environment has its own advantages. Similar to the first generation of smart contract platforms. having more applications in an environment will facilitate interaction easier. Cardano can provide decentralized properties as a service. New app chains can benefit from the construction of Partnerchain and take advantage of Cardanos infrastructure. Operation of decentralized infrastructure will become more professional. To pursue high performance. decentralization may be damaged. Appchain groups will need to balance between decentralized and performance. We should not expect Ethereum applications to switch to Cardano because the Uniswap group and other Ethereum projects will continue to use Ethereum technology. Building a new app chain often means that groups have to start over and they may not choose EVM as the best solution.',\n",
       " ' Cardano is on a promising road. With the launch of Midnights testing network. the partnerchain frame is expected to launch soon. Many other apps will soon be built. The ability to interact between application chains will be very important. This can make Cardano an important center. Although high expansion is important for blockchain. security and decentralization will always be a top priority. Original assets. decentralized properties and Cardanos UTXO accounting model will still be attractive to many developers. In the near future. most transactions may take place on-chain application. Blockchain must prioritize decentralized and security to maintain competitiveness. Perhaps it is time to consider what traditional blockchain can provide to users in a world where most utilities and users use the application chain. Blockchain is still in the early stage. so the trend can change again. The Wanchain bridge connects Cardano with many Layers 1 and Layer 2 in a decentralized way. does not supervise and no need to be allowed. This allows BTC. ETH. Stablecoin and many other assets to Cardano or from Cardano to other networks. we will explain how the Wanchain Bridge works. There are many blockchain projects. each project has its trade -off. Groups often focus on their projects but pay little attention to interaction. Despite nearly a decade of discussion. the achievement of decentralized blockchain connection. no supervision and no need to be allowed still has many challenges. many blockchain and layers 2 are underwent and significant liquidity. A method to connect these networks is through a bridge. A bridge can link two networks and by supporting multiple network pairs. which can create a network of blockchains. To accomplish this. the bridge must understand the transactions. consensus mechanisms and the enforcement environment of both networks that it aims to connect. Wanchain Bridge can transfer assets from one network to another and vice versa. The Wanchain bridge can transfer not only the original coins and tokens but also NFT. With Wanchain Bridge. we can use the edition versions of BTC. Stablecoin USDC and USDT. ERC-20 token. In Cardano ecosystem. The consensus mechanism of the Wanchain blockchain. called the Galaxy. is based on Ouroboros POS. Blockchain Wanchain uses account -based model and EVM. Like Cardano. the Wanchain network uses Token Wan to encourage Stake activities and operate node. The Wan owner can choose Stake their token into the Blockchain POS (5. 24% APR) or the Wanchain Bridge (6. 39% APR). The Wanchain bridge consists of 25 nodes called Node Storeman. no node of these 25 nodes is operated by Wanchain. The consensus mechanism is based on the calculation of many parties. Cross -chain transactions are considered valid if 17 of the 25 nodes agree. As shown in detail below. cross-chain transactions include pairs of Lock-Mint or Burn-Unlock operating pairs. When 17 of the 25 nodes agree with the first operation. the second node can proceed. The Wanchain Bridge can connect Cardano to Bitcoin. Polkadot. Arbitrum. Polygon and other networks. The bridge must ensure the maintenance of asset value.',\n",
       " ' preventing a single value represented by two tokens on different networks. When a property is transferred from one network to another. its spending value only exists in one place. Each property originates from a specific network. called the original network. The bridge must transfer the value of assets to another network safely. called the target network and ensure the property can return to the original network. Wanchain Bridge uses two separate methods to create favorable conditions for Cross Chain transactions:. Go into detail each mechanism in detail. The Wanchain Bridge uses a single lock and unlocking pair. called Wanchain Xflows. to transfer the cross -chain from the root to the root. This ensures that only the original token is used in both the original network and the target network. This is how to work: in the original network. such as Ethereum. 1000 USDT is locked. After this lock is confirmed. 1000 USDT will be unlocked in the target network. like Polygon. Because this mechanism works with original tokens. there is no need to cast or burn tokens. Just having a liquidity pool is enough. The Wanchain bridge uses two pairs of activities: Lock-Mint and Burn-Unlock. which are automatic activities. It is used for the original cross -token cross -chain transactions. This mechanism facilitates the creation of tokens wrapped from the original network on the target. these packages can be used in the DEFI ecosystem of the target network. when converting ETH from Ethereum to Cardano. the Wanchain bridge will first lock ETH online. After the lock is confirmed. it will create tokens equivalent to ETH locked on Cardano network under a single ID. identified as Waneth (red in the picture). The opposite process occurs if the user decides to send Waneth back to Ethereum. Waneth is burned on Cardano network and after the burning process is confirmed. ETH will initially be unlocked on the Ethereum network. If a property is transferred for the first time. the property must be registered in advance. Wanchain will use trading details to create smart contracts from a new model. The initial-chain on-chain lock node. the authentic person will use the smart contract (or instructions) to cast the equivalent tokens on the target. If the incident occurs during authentication. the property will be returned to the transaction initialist and there will be no new tokens created on the target. This process is similar to returning the property to the original network. If the authentic person lacks sufficient evidence of burning property in the destination network. the original property cannot be returned to the original network. Wanchain bridge automatically operates without the central agency. Wanchain uses a number of advanced encryption technologies. including multi -side safety calculations (MPC). sharing secrets according to the threshold. round signature diagram based on elliptical coding and accounting mechanisms once. These technologies also solve the privacy protection challenges of smart contract tokens. MPC allows many parties to perform calculations on privacy without disclosing the input of each individual. ensuring the security and integrity of sensitive information.',\n",
       " ' Wanchain uses a separate locking feature. in which the MPC wallet is divided into several parts. each part is held by a different side. This setup prevents any individual access and control. One threshold is set. requiring a minimum number of parties (17 out of 25 entities) to allow transactions or calculations. Wanchain Bridges allows two -dimensional cross -chain transactions. without multiple networks. The original ADA and Cardano assets can be transferred to EVM string and vice versa. ERC-20 and other assets can be transferred from the EVM string to Cardano. the launch of a new bridge between Cardano and Solana has been announced. The community can expect to directly connect USDCCC between Cardano and Solana. Sol on Cardano from Solana and Ada on Solana from Cardano. The connection of Cardano with the EVM string pose a significant challenge for the Wanchain group because Cardano is not compatible with EVM. Cardano uses the Plutus . UTXO -based command instead of the account -based model and different signature schemes. especially supporting EDDSA and Curve25519. In order to facilitate the Cross Chain transactions with both EVM and not EVM. the Wanchain group developed the Haskell. It should be noted that cross -chain transactions only become feasible after the 2023 Valentine update of Cardano. this update has introduced support for Schnorr signatures and SCP256K1 curves. This makes the connection with Bitcoin feasible because Bitcoin uses the Schnorr signature diagram. Wanchain will also allow NFT to move between EVM and Cardano. marking another important milestone for blockchain interaction. Stablecoin is an important topic for the Cardano community. especially when Cardano lacks Stablecoin USDC and the original USDT. The Wanchain Bridge can facilitate the transfer of USDC and USDT to the string to cardano by Lock-Mint / Burn-Unlock method. Finally but no less important. Wachain Bridge launched Cardano Bridge on August 8. 2023 and has achieved quite a lot of achievements in just one year. As you can see in the information graphics below. If you like what you have learned about Wanchain Bridge. please try it today.October 17. In computer science. two major problems that researchers face are the ability to dispersing systems and ensuring security. Blockchain. with decentralized nature. is the intersection of these two challenges. On the one hand. distributed systems require a global consensus mechanism. on the other hand. to ensure data safety from malicious attacks. This is why the development of blockchain systems is not simply a technical task. but also requires thorough research from theoretical and practical aspects. Nicol from France. Director of Software Architecture at Input Output Global (IOG). said that most of the groups work is to find new solutions to solve problems in the Cardano blockchaino community. This team does not only stop at giving new ideas. but also must check whether these ideas are feasible in the real world. This helps to narrow the gap between theory and practice. This process requires continuous re -evaluation of research results from the community. and then proceeds to identify ideas that can be applied to the final product.',\n",
       " ' A typical example is Hydra and Mithril. two key projects in expanding Cardanos capabilities. which have undergone strict testing before reaching the stage of realization. Christian B. a researcher and director of the research strategy at IOG. said that Blockchain needs to balance many conflicting requirements. with decentralized characteristics. faced the challenge of expanding global scale while maintaining security. A prominent example is the payment system such as Visa or MasterCard. which can process thousands of transactions per second. they depend on a centralized system. which blockchain cannot follow due to its decentralization. One of the weaknesses of blockchain systems is the time to confirm the transaction. Nakamoto -style systems. requires a certain time to ensure that the transaction has been confirmed safely. Christian and his group are researching how to reduce this time while ensuring security. One of the important efforts that IOG is implementing is the development of the Paras protocol. a solution to speed up the transaction confirmation. This protocol allows transactions to be confirmed faster without having to sacrifice security or decentralization. While other protocols like Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) can achieve a fast confirmation speed. they lack the ability to heal themselves that Cardano\\\\s Ouroboros system offers. This means that even if a part of the network is attacked. the system can recover itself when the nodes honestly return. Sandro G. a researcher of IOG. said theoretical research was the first step. but in fact when deploying the system. it required more models and verification. During Paras development. researchers had to adjust the theoretical model to suit the reality of the dispersed blockchain network. One of the important tools that the group used is Delta Q. a method that helps analyze the behavior of the system without having to build a complex prototype. This saves time and costs during development. In order to put an idea from the theory. the team at IOG must work closely from the design stage on paper. theoretical modeling. to the implementation and practical testing. Nicol has shown that verifying research hypotheses is extremely important. and they always try to give feedback as soon as possible to adjust before entering the production phase. IOG is continuing to invest heavily in the use of formal tools like AGDA to ensure that theoretical models are accurate and can be converted into actual source code. This not only helps to ensure the correctness of the system. but also increases the reliability of the community for the protocols that Cardano uses. Blockchain is an area that requires a close combination of theory and practice. At IOG. research teams do not only stop at proposing new solutions but also to ensure that they can be deployed in a realistic environment. This requires continuous innovation and continuous testing to ensure that systems like Cardano can develop sustainably and meet the needs of users. This article helps to clarify how to research. innovate and implement cooperation in reality to develop safe and effective blockchain systems.October 14. Introduce.',\n",
       " ' The decentralized physical infrastructure network (depin) represents a new approach. using Blockchain technology to develop and manage physical infrastructure. This change focuses on decentralization of essential services. which are often monopolized by large corporations. such as wireless networks. data storage. and energy net. By taking advantage of Blockchain. Depin aims to reduce costs. enhance access to the community to build and manage their own networks. Depin has attracted attention as a big trend in the blockchain space. its success depends on overcoming a number of obstacles:. - Challenges on regulations: When Depin develops and becomes a competitive threat with large technology corporations. it will attract more and more supervision from management agencies. Proactively cooperating with managers is very important to ensure Depin projects comply with the regulations and avoid the challenges that Crypto token has encountered. - Concerned about user experience (UX): In order for Depin to be widely used. it must provide a user -friendly experience. which can be compared to traditional web2 services. The success of Depin projects depends on making blockchain technology seamless and transparent for end users. like the way Uber and Airbnb did with the shared economy. - The ability to expand and cooperate: Depin can be widely applied in addition to wireless networks and data storage. including energy and computing. To maximize efficiency. Depin projects are discovering cooperation. many services can be provided from a single physical infrastructure. thereby improving both useful and resource efficiency. - Creating demand: The initial acceptance is often hindered by limited demand. promoting demand is very important. As more and more decentralized applications appear and web3 becomes popular. the demand for depin solutions is expected to increase significantly. The Depin model seems to be on the rapidly growing momentum for the next 5 years. When technology continues to progress and mature depin projects. they are likely to become an indispensable part of the digital economy. Depin not only has the potential to revolutionize specific areas but also integrate into everyday life. open a new era of decentralized infrastructure and managed by the community.October 3. Cardanos Partnerchain. empower the developers to create applications that comply with regulations quickly and safely to protect both personal and commercial data. The project has achieved an important milestone when launching a test network that can be openly accessible. allowing developers to start building data protection applications. The public launch of the test shows that a significant part of the project is in an advanced development stage. Although the launch date of the mainnet has not been announced. we can predict the update will take place in the next year. Midnight takes advantage of Zero-Knowledge (Zero-Knowledge) technology to process user data transactions without revealing them. if Alice sends the property to Bob on the Midnight network. the transaction details can be kept in private mode and does not automatically appear on the blockchain. This ensures that the identity of users is protected and personal data remains on their devices. Midnight programmable data protection mechanism gives developers the flexibility in deciding which data will be publicly opened on-chain and which data needs to be kept secret.',\n",
       " ' This allows for balanced applications between data protection and transparency of blockchain. There are many types of Zero-Knowledge (ZKP) evidence with different assumptions on performance and coding. Midnight uses Zero-Knowledge Snarks to separate the public and privacy data of the application. ensuring sensitive information remains on the owners system or device. Midnight introduces a new contract definition language called Compact. based on TypeScript. TypeScript is one of the most popular programming languages \\\\u200b\\\\u200btoday. This language helps developers. even those with less experience in blockchain technology or Zero-Knowledge. easily starting to write smart contracts. They can use TypeScript libraries to help them quickly build and launch new Dapps. The IOG group aims to simplify development for developers by providing a familiar environment and programming language. Some developers found Plutus challenging when working with Cardano. Aiken has become the most popular programming language to develop cardano applications. Construction with Midnight will be relatively simple. In order for blockchain applications to achieve commercial success. they must ensure the protection of sensitive data of users. When processing sensitive data. developers can use Midnights smart contracts to send confidential evidence by code to the network instead of sharing actual data. Data protection is not only a legal requirement in many countries for financial activities and interacting with the Internet but also the needs of users who want to trade. The Midnight network is designed for developers and organizations that need the transparency of blockchain technology and require strong data protection. From the perspective of tokenomics. Midnight is especially advantageous. It can prevent double spending attacks and ensure that the supply of circulation does not increase artificially. while keeping transactions in private mode. This is very important because it allows people to publicly verify specific data that needs to be able to access and reliably while retaining other personal data. Midnight seems to be an ideal foundation for national currency casting with fixed inflation. no such notice is given. the alpha release of Blockchain Midnight. acts as a development testing place to test the construction of on-chain applications to protect sensitive data. Users can build and run secret smart contracts while familiarizing with Zero-Knowledge technology. Midnight minimizes the need to reset the frequent string in the process of upgrading. inspired by Cardanos hardfork approach. These hardforks can be activated to upgrade significant features and network performance in the testnet phase onwards without interrupting existing projects or requiring developers to deploy their applications. I predict that the group will manage the upgrade activation in the first phase of the project. the management token will be used for that. TestNet introduces the ability to upgrade Zero-Knowledge Snark. a new feature that ensures developers can benefit from the latest and future performance improvements in the Zero-Knowledge technology without rewriting or re-implementing their smart contracts. This is also a very important aspect but is often underestimated. We will see how it works in reality. TestNet acts as a platform that proves for strict testing and screening. ensuring the stability. security and performance of the network.',\n",
       " ' Developers can significantly affect Midnights development and help shape the future of data protection by developing testing applications on the testing network. I predict that there will be Airdrop Night before launching the main network. Cardano Spo. along with other interested parties. may run node midnight. The casting may require Stake Night. similar to Cardano. Night holder will authorize tokens to operate and may receive Stake rewards. these specific details have not been confirmed. All developers are welcome. Try Midnight and give the group to develop important feedback.October 1. Partnerchain Cardano specializes in data protection. will introduce two tokens: Dust and Night. Although having two tokens is not common for a blockchain project. it is not unprecedented. the NEO project also uses NEO and GAS. Although the specific details of the relationship between Dust and Night have not been disclosed. this official research report provides detailed information about the systems expected function. Building an effective operation system with a pair of tokens can be a significant challenge for the group. Popular blockchains such as Cardano. Bitcoin and Ethereum use the original token as a reward for Node operators and pay network usage fees. The circulation of tokens in the ecosystem is very simple: users pay by the same type of token that the Node operator receives. Some users only need to keep money without actively using the network. Although this system is simple. it has a disadvantage: the high volatility of tokens affects the fee. Cardano has a fixed fee. A common cardano transaction is charged 0. 17 ADA. which can fluctuate in the dollar based on ADAs market price. Projects with a fees. will see the fee increases according to the users transaction needs. And the fee is affected by both fluctuations and demand. Unpredictable network costs in the future can be a concern for users. especially businesses. Midnight solves this problem skillfully by introducing two tokens: Dust and Night. This approach separates the management incentives and node operators from the user fee. Night is a non -security token used for administration. consensus and block production rewards. It works similar to ADA. but unlike ADA. Night cannot be used to pay for the network use. Night can be transferred between addresses and buy or sell on exchanges. Night will originally exist as the original property of Cardano. Dust is described as a token to access the amount needed for network use. Dust is a confidential token that cannot be moved between addresses. Historically. private tokens such as Monero were delisted from trading floors due to legal pressure. This listing has a negative impact on their market capitalization and privacy budget. as blockchain security often increases with higher attack costs. If the dust token can be transferred between users. it can be considered a private token. which can lead to the cancellation of the Midnight project from the exchanges. Midnight will allow users to submit private transactions and support for identity management and selective disclosure. This makes it different from the completely private tokens.',\n",
       " ' Dust is a bit similar to the gas token but there are some main differences. When using Dust. it will not be possible to associate the fees for transactions and its super data. In order for transactions to be kept in private mode. this must also be applied to fees. I predict that the fee will be fixed according to the Dust value. a standard transaction may cost about 1 dust. The White Book describes Dust as energy that can be kept valuable but cannot be maintained for a long time. The Dust token will be created in the ratio from the Night token. Users hold a certain amount of Night will earn Dust. allowing them to use the network. This is beneficial for users because they can basically use the network for free by holding the Night token. the disadvantage is that they may have to wait for a period of unknown time for the dust token to be created from the Night token. If the user knows they need to send the average 5 transactions per day. they can easily calculate the number of Night tokens needed. These Night tokens will create the Dust token to cover transaction fees. I had seen similar concepts because users only pay once for the Night token and theoretically can use the free network indefinitely. This can lead to economic collapse because each transaction is subject to costs of computer resources consumption. It will not be sustainable when paying for 5 transactions and then deposit 5000. Another hidden problem is that a large entity can produce a significant amount of Dust tokens. which is exclusively partly partly part of the network\\\\s capacity. If the networks capacity cannot meet the maximum number of dust tokens. the smaller users can see that the Midnight network cannot access. The attacker can exploit this by sending unnecessary transactions to exhaust the capacity of the network. launch an effective low -cost attack just by buying the original Night token. Night is described as a deflation token. it is still unclear what will encourage network operators when all Night tokens are circulated. If I understand exactly. Dust will be consumed during the network use. The new Night token cannot be created from consumed token. as this will lead to continuous increase in the number of Night token. causing them to cause inflation instead of deflation as declared. If only users hold Night token to create Dust. the protocol will lack Night token to receive rewards. while the network still needs to provide computer resources to process transactions. The Midnight group will need to solve these problems and I believe they have solutions. This system is very convenient for Midnight service consumers. Midnight is Cardanos partnerchain. If a cardano application development group requires security service for 1000 users a day. they can calculate the cost of these services according to the Dust value and buy the amount of Night token needed corresponding. This setup encourages groups to hold Night to create Dust.',\n",
       " ' allowing them to use midnight services basically free. This mechanism is especially beneficial for third -party groups. The anchor project has a similar model. in which anchor token creates gas token to pay. gas tokens can be purchased and sold. leading to speculation about whether anchor or gas will keep more value over time. Midnight avoids this problem by making Dust unable to transfer. The market price associated with the economic importance of the network will be associated with the Night token. Another potential drawback is that investors can hold a large number of Night without active using the network. If the cost of buying a high Night token. the network can become less comprehensive. if the user needs to own 100 Night token to create enough dust for a week and each Night token costs $ 1. the network may not be able to access economically for people in developing countries. As mentioned earlier. not all details of the relationship between Night and Dust are known. So our speculation may be soon. The group is expected to publish an article that provides more detailed descriptions of the mechanism. We realize many challenges that the group will need to overcome. if they succeed. Night can become a very attractive token to hold because it will allow free access to security services.September 27. Midnight is advertised as the fourth generation blockchain. using non -knowledge evidence (ZK Proofs) to keep user data security. This makes it a great solution for companies that need to manage private data safely. The ability to create favorable conditions for Midnights private transactions to enhance its attractiveness. in which Midnight is ready to become Cardanos first partner. Lets explore the meaning of this cooperation. Partnerchain will act as independent blockchain. each string has tokens. trading logic. administration model. enforcement environment and consensus mechanism. They can cast their tokens without relying on cardano. The IOG group is developing the partnerchain frame using Substrate Parity. This frame is aimed at creating favorable conditions for the creation of new blockchains in the Cardano ecosystem that can interact seamlessly with Cardano. The property layer and Cardano payment (CaSL) can act as the core of this infrastructure. using different services from Partnerchain. It should be noted that users and businesses can access the service of the independent partnerchain with Cardano. Stake Pool (SPO) operators in Cardano ecosystem form one of the most decentralized infrastructure in the blockchain industry. SPO will be able to operate the node for Partnerchain. giving them a new source of revenue. Cardano ecosystem will provide a decentralized personality as a service for partnerchains. creating an important link between Cardano and its partners. Midnight is expected to be Cardanos first partnerchain. Focusing on user data security by taking advantage of non -knowledge evidence (ZKP). Midnight will provide this service to users and businesses. and developers built on Cardano will also be able to use this service. Midnight is expected to have a unique double consensus mechanism that integrates the Proof of Work and Proof of Stake (Minotaur).',\n",
       " ' Midnight will allow users to send private transactions. similar to Zcashs ability. it can secure the intermediate states of any smart contract execution process with the ZKP (Kachina) system. It will be able to secure the data programmed with selective disclosure. Midnight will have two tokens: Night and Dust. Night. a non -confidential token. will be used to manage. participate in consensus and block production rewards. Night will exist as a original asset of Cardano. Dust will be a secured resource token. supporting activities in the chain. acting as a fuel for the network. The most powerful relationship between Cardano and Midnight will be their inherent interaction feature. This will help developers easily build services using both Cardano and Midnight features. while helping users to move seamlessly between two chains. Cardano users will be able to access Midnights security services that often do not realize that they are using Midnight. Some users may mainly use Midnight and do not know about cardano. In contrast. Midnight can act as the Cardano ecosystem for others. depending on their needs. From a wider perspective. most users may not apply blockchain technology by holding tokens but using different services. often do not know which blockchain is related. Developers have the same thoughts and find the best solution for their projects. For services depending on privacy. Midnight may be the priority platform. Hardver Chang introduced Zero-Knowledge password for Cardano. allowing creating projects similar to Midnight. Midnight will be a more advanced platform in terms of privacy. providing the capabilities that Cardano cannot have. Midnights ledger supports both the original and not confidential data. allowing selective disclosure. a feature not available on Cardano. Many people consider Midnight as a competitor to Cardano. a concept that can come from the common localism in the Blockchain ecosystem. where all blockchains are considered competitors. Success in this field is closely linked to the network effect. If we can predict which blockchain will have the largest network effect in 25 years. we will know the winner. The network effect is very important for transaction fees. which is essential for long -term economic sustainability of any blockchain. In the Ethereum ecosystem. we observe that users move from layer 1 to layer 2 different. Some people think that Layer 2 is parasitic on Ethereum in terms of fee and user. while others believe that Ethereum benefits from the network effects to enhance the overall ecosystem. Both views have some facts. Obviously. if the blockchain industry is successful. many blockchains will thrive. connected and provide diverse functions. Each main blockchain can have millions of users daily. Midnight will provide privacy not only for the Cardano ecosystem but also for other blockchains. This will promote the success of the entire industry. not just a single ecosystem. The partnership is often formed because of the common need. ideally to benefit both sides. Midnight will rely on Cardano for decentralization. which will benefit Spo. users of cardano -based applications can take advantage of security services provided by Midnight.',\n",
       " ' Our goal is to achieve widespread acceptance. By combining different components. like assembling LEGO pieces. we can create a comprehensive service that can become a sought -after assassin application in the field of crypto. Midnight is a partner that will introduce a new function for Cardano ecosystem. just like other partners can add additional features. Midnights contributions will benefit Cardano.September 26. Cardano has deployed the first phase of the On-Chain Administration. but the founding units still exist and have a significant influence on the project. These entities have received ADA at the beginning of the Cardano project. called Genesis. These tokens allow them to recruit individuals to work for Cardano. thereby maintaining project control. There are two parallel budgets: Genesis coin managed by the founding units and the Cardano budget supervised by Dreps. How will these entities cooperate in the future?. At the beginning of the Cardano project. three founding units divided their roles. The IOG group focuses on research and development. handling the deployment of protocols along with all related technologies. Cardano Fund. besides other things. also owns the projects brand. participates with businesses and management agencies. network monitoring. Summit Cardano and community support. Emurgo promotes the application of the project through many different commercial roads. Genesis allows these entities to fulfill their corresponding role. How to manage on-chain integrated into this framework?. On-chain administration refers to a system in which blockchain network decisions are made directly with the mainnet blockchain. This is often related to the voting mechanism in which the token owner can propose and vote on changes to the rules or specifications of the network. On-chain administration also includes Cardano fund. All registered Drep will have a significant influence in deciding to change the protocol parameter and withdraws ADA from the fund. From a decentralized perspective. the community really controlled the protocol through the ADA. The founding entities can also play an important role in managing by registering as Dreps or by authorizing their Stake. even though they havent done so. the Cardano Constitution and the Constitutional Committee play an important role in ensuring that all approved management actions are donated. It should be noted that the founding units maintain the project control without using their ADA token. a situation originating from the history of the project. These entities will continue to exist despite the introduction of On-Chain Administration and that is completely fine. Below we will describe the founding units that truly control. The founding units recruit hundreds of individuals to be paid in Genesis. These employees perform tasks that Dreps cannot perform. They include programmers and other IT experts. researchers. lawyers. former entrepreneurs. adventurous capital sponsors. executives. trainers. The main role of Dreps is voting; They often lack time and expertise to perform functions similar to employees of the founding units. The community sometimes has unrealistic expectations for Dreps. they may expect Dreps to create favorable conditions for USDC deployment on Cardano. This task is significantly more complicated for Dreps compared to members of Cardano Foundation or Emurgo.',\n",
       " ' Although any Drep or DREP group can start communicating with Circle. their ability to negotiate is limited. If Circle requires a higher USD amount to deploy USDC. Dreps can only propose administrative actions and cannot give any binding promise. along with members of the Constitutional Committee (CC). represents a new entity in the power structure of Cardano ecosystem. As individuals continue to register the Drep position. relationships and communication channels are set between Dreps and the founding units currently lacking. this may develop in the future. After the on-chain administration is fully developed. the power structures in the Cardano ecosystem will look as described in the picture. Founding and SPO organizations will have the participation of Dreps and CC members. ADA holders only affect the production of blocks through SPO. but now they also control network parameters. activate hardfork and budget. After the genesis lock is invalidated. the founding entities will no longer affect the protocol or fund. the IOG group will still be responsible for deploying Node Cardano. Some Genesis might have been used because the founding units have sponsored their activities for about seven years. Cardano should rely on the budget. Founders can search for funding from the fund for certain projects. if Circle proposes to deploy USDC on Cardano for $ 50 million in the future. there are two ways to sponsor it: or a founding founding from the Genesis or decided through administrative actions. In the second case. Dreps will vote on it and CC members must ensure that the action is donation. The deployment of USDC will be sponsored from the budget. Building communication channels and promoting effective interaction between Dreps and founding units will be essential. The question of whether Dreps should be paid to their voting work or not. When Intersect is preparing the DREP pioneering program. this issue is one of the four main modules. The management team has prepared for the on-chain management for many years. foresee this option. if the owner of ADA oppose. Dreps will not receive compensation. For dreps who want to participate more than just voting. they may need to search for positions in founding units or become SPO if they have not run a pool. The integration of DREPS into founding entities can benefit the ecosystem. Dreps will get more direct information and deeper understanding of the needs of the Cardano ecosystem. People who lack time to solve complicated problems or access certain information may not have relevant data for their votes. Dreps can share community views with founding units and bring new views. The ideal disc discussion is still happening. Some believe that Cardano must be completely independent of the founding units. making Dreps also become independent. founding units are obliged to use genesis before escaping the ecosystem. they can send the remaining genesis to the budget. although this may not be ideal. The founding units have contributed significantly and very important to the ecosystem. closely connecting or integrating Dreps into these entities seems more convenient.',\n",
       " ' Some ADA owners like Dreps are not SPOs because there may be conflicts of interest. Technically. it is impossible to prevent SPO from becoming Drep (and vice versa). It depends on the choice of the owner ADA for the person they authorize to vote. if Drep wants to participate in more activities rather than just voting. such as deeply understanding complex administrative actions and community debates. that will require significant time and effort. In this context. it seems fair when the dreps are active starting to run a Stake Pool. There may be authorized people who want to authorize both voting and stake rights for such Dreps. Many topics need to be resolved and we will need to find answers. Money is always associated with power. The founding units will need Dreps because they ask ADA from the budget. Dreps will search for more information about the needs of the Cardano ecosystem that they can get from the founding units. It will be interesting to see how the relationship between Dreps and the founding units develop. It should be noted that the Cardano power structure at first glance seems complicated due to the participation of many entities. the right to make an important decision belongs to the people holding ADA. Although the founding entities can significantly affect the application. infrastructure and protocol. their control ability to the protocol themselves is very limited. A significant part of Spo must voluntarily install a new version of Node Cardano. all three new administrators must approve the administrative action to activate hardfork. This process is no longer under the control of the founding units.September 18. Starting from September 1. after hardfork Chang. individuals who are interested in administration on-chain can start registering as Dreps. ADA holders may start authorizing their voting authority to these dreps. the growth rate was rapid but then the growth rate began to stagnate. The figure is no longer as increasing as at the beginning. Join us as we continue to go into the factors that are hindering people authorizing their voting rights. We will also provide some advice to support the authorization process. about 460 Drep has been registered. of which 50 people have stopped working. can represent the initial registration. Only 5.800 ADA owners authorized their voting authority to Dreps. with a total of 482 million ADA. 102 million ADA has been authorized for Abstain Drep. saying that the holders have selected clearly not to participate in the administration. This means about 1% of authorized circulation supply. While 1. 3 million ADA owners authorized the Pool. only about 0. 5% were authorized for Drep. More than 20% of Stake are authorized for Dreps to choose the White Boot option. with more than 1.500 ADA owners options. We are still at the beginning. so determining whether these numbers are positive or negative as a challenge. we subjectively notice that there is a certain stagnation both in terms of the number of Drep registered as well as the number of entrusters.',\n",
       " ' It seems that people who are interested in registering to do Dreps have done so and very few new registration takes place. The same trend is observed in those authorized. although the authorization process takes place relatively quickly and simply. Based on our observations and research. we have identified a number of reasons why the number of authorization for low dreps:. A large number of surprised people expressed difficulties in searching for information about Dreps. They want to understand their motives. goals and qualifications before authorizing. which is a positive sign of caution. Although almost all Explorer Cardano programs support governance. the easiest way to view details about each drop is through Govtools (https: // administration/connected/drep_directory). When Dreps registered with Govtools. they had the option to provide additional information about themselves. such as linking to social networks. reward addresses and even linking to their real identity. And Govtools is the best resource to display this data. Users can navigate to the Drep folder from the menu. find Drep according to its ID (or select a Drep from the list according to the name). then click ‘See details’. Govtools can be used as a voting authorization tool. Just connecting Cardano wallet. this operation will allow you to click the blue ‘delegate’ button. Yoroi and Lace wallets are compatible with Govtools. Eternl and Yoroi support direct management in their interface. so there is no need to connect with Govtools to authorize. Just navigate to the management part in the wallet. enter ID drep into authorized transactions and sign the transaction. If your wallet does not directly support the administration and cannot connect to Govtools. there is another option. If you use a hardware wallet. you can use any lightweight number of wallets safely and easily by Enter the general lock from the hardware wallet into the lightweight wallet (https://cexplorer. io/article/hw-wallets-enable- Use multi-light wallet). Many people do not know this ability and wait for their wallets to support administrative activities. This is also applied to full-node Daedalus. currently not supporting administrative actions. The IOG group has announced that they are trying to supplement administration. People are often confused by the existence of two standards for ID DREP: CIP-105 and CIP-129. This leads to two different ID dreps. although both represent the same number on-chain. only displayed. which ID you use is not important. Dreps often have both IDs on their profile because different tools or wallets use different standards. Govtools prefer CIP-105 ID. the use of ID originating from CIP-129 will make the Drep lookup process unsuccessful. Eternl Wallet can display both the Drep ID and search for Drep according to both CIP-105 and CIP-129 standards. CIP-105 was published on Cardano Foundation in the standard form that has been reviewed by the community and advanced by the CIP Editorial Board. And it should be preferred by users. wallets and tools. Many people still keep ADA in their old wallets. since then they have authorized Stake Pool for a long time. They may no longer actively monitor Crypto or Cardano.',\n",
       " ' So they dont know that they should authorize Dreps. We need to find ways to attract these users. Perhaps the wallet will display the reminder to the user that they are not authorized for Drep. if users hold ADA on centralized exchanges. they cannot authorize Dreps. Some suggested that these centralized entities should support management. but this is very unlikely. Users should transfer their ADA to their own cardano wallet and then authorize both Stake Pool and Drep. Some people recommend providing economic encouragement measures for authorization. AirDrop ADA for authorized people are randomly selected. Although I am not sure whether this Airdrop method is suitable for Cardano. this is definitely a worthy idea. We need to find a way to provide ADA for this offer. Stake will not be able to withdraw the Stake reward unless they authorize a Drep or choose a governors position. They will not lose any stake rewards because they will continue to accumulate in the reward account. to withdraw them. they must first authorize Drep or choose a position with onchain administration. This form of encouragement may be effective but can make many users lack of confusion. They can quickly select the first whitening or ID Drep options they meet. usually the Drep ID of the wallet construction group. Ada holders are not forced to search for Drep to authorize their voting authority. they may consider becoming a drep and voting directly. Some wallets and Govtools support this option. Do not hesitate to authorize your ADA to Dreps. The best benefit of Cardano is to be authorized for DREPS as much Stake as possible. This is very important to build trust in Cardano\\\\s governance. because the shares voting are greater than essential. Some community members believe that people will start registering when the vote on an important management action. This may be the necessary motivation to encourage people to authorize or vote for themselves. Some ada owners are not sure whether their stake will be successfully authorized after authorizing Drep. To verify. they can use the trading ID to check it in the Explorer Blockchain. where they will find authorized certificate with Drep ID. Eternl can also display these details.September 13. one of the three founding units of Cardano. announced a strategic partnership with IBEX. Antlers business renovation branch. a leading investor in the early stages. This initiative can benefit projects built on Cardano by providing external capital. meaning ADA from the budget may not be used. It is encouraging to see Emurgo strive to promote the Cardano ecosystem. I will discover why the VC Funds presence is beneficial for Cardano. how it can supplement Catalyst and how it can save ADA in the budget. The market price is a challenging period for many projects on all blockchain ecosystems. with many groups struggling to survive due to insufficient capital to complete their projects. the completion of projects may face many challenges because they are built on the growing platform. The necessary tools or libraries are often missing.',\n",
       " ' requiring groups to develop them independently or waiting. The construction of decentralized applications is still in the early stage and requires significantly more demanding than creating a traditional workstation app. Until a application is deployed on Cardano and has a solid number of loyal users. the group will not have a source of income. Projects are often funded by casting tokens and sold to community members or project fans. In the market price. the market price of tokens from all large blockchains can be reduced from 50% to 80%. The unused project token is similarly affected. The group is forced to sell some of their tokens. which reduces the market price and negatively impacts all the holders. The fluctuations set significant challenges for developers because they require stability for a longer period of time. usually lasting a few years. A group may have a great idea and vision but if there is no capital to implement. the completion of the project is usually impossible. If the project is not completed. the entire ecosystem will be affected. Cardanos success depends on the utilities that it brings to the user. Cardano itself is a basic class that provides basic functions such as sending transactions. executing commands. stake and decentralized. The actual value lies in what the third party group built in this class. Cardano can ensure funding for groups through Catalyst. but limited budget and the community decides which project will support. Not all projects deserve to receive funding and Catalyst cannot be the only source of support for projects built on Cardano. Some projects that have the potential to provide cases used in the real world may need relatively large funding compared to the Catalyst budget. In the latest rounds. Catalyst has been allowed to provide 50 million ADA. supporting about 1.000 projects. The community will control the Cardano budget and tend to use ADA from the fund to make VC capital controlled by third parties. This is not recommended. A part of the budget can support projects that have a significant impact on the ecosystem. but investing in unfinished projects always has many risks. I can imagine the voting community to fund the deployment of USDC or USDT on Cardano. Such a project may deserve to be supported by the fund due to its potential positive impact. because many users want to have these established stablecoins on Cardano. I could not think of another project that could justify the same for withdrawing ADA from the budget. The cooperation of EMURGO with IBEX of Antler is a great news. because it solves some problems at the same time. External funding search groups now have the opportunity to receive it. reducing the demand for ADA from the budget for the same purpose. It also eliminates the need to use ADA to pay for a team to invest in the Cardano ecosystem. the group will probably receive financial support with legal money. helping to plan more efficient budget. Building a better reputation among venture capital funds and introducing Cardano as an investment opportunity is beneficial.',\n",
       " ' Emurgo has achieved this and we can only hope this is not the last notice of this type. If projects can be completed through funding. new users will participate and improve network effects. This will attract attention. especially from other investors. More applications will be built. bringing more new users. It is essential to start this successful whirlpool. Building Cardano requires great resources in time. manpower and finance. The expansion capacity still needs to be improved. this is the last big barrier for Cardanos global success. the continuous improvement and completion will be necessary. this is only the first important step. The second step involves the construction of applications and services that require funding. The three founding units can and should support this funding. We must praise Emurgo for their newly established cooperation and wish them to continue.September 10. After the hardfork Chang. the Cardano community was very happy to be able to make a decision related to ADA in the fund. Although some members propose investment in marketing. it should be noted that our goal is not ADA spending from the budget as quickly as possible. This resource may be invaluable in the future. Be responsible. We believe that Cardano should prioritize the support activities that have a long -term impact on the project. instead of short -term initiatives with uncertain results. Use ADA from the fund wisely to ensure growth and sustainable development. We should only allocate the minimum number of ADA for marketing activities. Ada in Cardano fund is a valuable resource that we must manage in a responsible way. Although there are often suggestions to increase marketing investment. we believe we should do it carefully. There are two extremist views on marketing. One is a good product without marketing. the other is success that can only be achieved through marketing. The first point of view assumes that if a product is the best on the market. the word of mouth from the satisfied users will naturally promote that product. And additional investment in marketing is not necessary. The second point of view recognizes high levels of competition in the market. especially in the crypto industry and said that investing in marketing is essential to gain advantages. This approach focuses on attracting potential investors or users. similar to how politicians invest more in marketing often winning voting. We are more in favor of the first idea. Investing in marketing may only have short -term effects. In a price market. it is expected that many newcomers will be involved in the market and smart marketing activities can attract some of them to Cardano. From this perspective. it seems that this is the right time for marketing. history shows that during the price market. the crypto industry must go through a large number of users. The blockchain industry is still lacking in utilities to retain users despite the decreased market price of tokens. like most blockchains. is still not ready to be widely applied. Perhaps Ethereum. with Layer 2 ecosystem.',\n",
       " ' has developed more to provide. the network focused on the server and controlled by groups of administrators may not be suitable for mass application. If we predict the market price will take place similarly. then the investment in marketing can now be like an incorrect investment and unnecessary waste for the ADA budget. We should focus on marketing when Cardano is better prepared in terms of technology for mass application. which will take a few more years. we should allocate ADA from the budget for long -term activities to the project. the more important thing for Cardano is to invest in building its ecosystem. This includes enhancing the ability to expand. DEFI. Zero-Knowledge and improve user interface. we need more liquidity and more people prefer stablecoins like USDC and USDT. Hardver Chang introduced not only on-chain but also Zero-Knowledge. This opens the way for the construction of Zero-Knowledge Rollup. Layer 2 focuses on privacy and other expandable solutions based on Zero-Knowledge code. do not forget Hydra. a channel -based solution similar to the Lightning Network. bringing many benefits. including the ability to use DEFI services. The IOG group is expected to provide Ouroboros Leios and Peras. which will enhance the network through and accelerate the settlement time. they are developing the partnerchain frame. allowing the creation of networks similar to networks in the Polkadot ecosystem. Until these technologies are available to users. considering the application of a series of cardano is meaningless. Allocate ADA from the fund to these activities and other initiatives related to the construction of infrastructure and DEFI ecosystem. we can use catalyst for this purpose. If we create something valuable. the user will come. If they stay. the money will follow. The powerful network effect will attract VC investors. The presence of users and projects supported by the VC Fund will create additional value that people will talk about. Oral promotion is free. Some principles still take effect for centuries. Expansion is a prerequisite for building a strong network effect. Until we solve the current shortage. the investment in marketing is meaningless. Cardano has a high decentralization and high security in the DEFI ecosystem. it has a large community of supporters. If we maintain these features and add the ability to expand. we can be one of the first blockchain on the market to provide this combination. Although Layer 2 is currently booming. they begin to encounter some shortcomings and criticism. Although Layer 2 is suitable for certain cases. they may not be ideal for other cases. I believe that Blockchain is more suitable than layer 2 to cast Rwa tokens. ## How to make good marketing?. Should marketing activities focus on the Cardano brand or the services built on it? Some people think that Cardano brand marketing is like TCP/IP marketing. which will not be effective because everyone uses platforms like Google. Facebook. X and Amazon without understanding the operation of the Internet. marketing services seem more practical. Blockchain and TCP/IP have a significant difference.',\n",
       " ' Blockchain works at the same level as Google or Meta. using the Internet for its functions. as a decentralized platform to build services. stands out by its decentralization - a feature not in TCP/IP. A decentralization based on the distribution of ADA. the Cardanos ADA bronze marketing is very meaningful. with the main message focusing on decentralization. That means most people will use cardano indirectly via wallet and DEFI application. some services can operate on Cardano that users do not recognize. And marketing these services is also very important. Each group should have its own marketing budget and do not automatically rely on ADA from the budget. The Polkadot project has shown us that brand marketing does not always bring the desired results. In the first half of 2024. Polkadot spent $ 37 million on marketing activities. Polkadot was ranked 12th according to market capitalization. It is now 15. If we decide to invest $ 40 million in marketing right now. we will need about 110 million ADA from the Cardano budget. It is about one -third of expected revenue for 2025. Learn from the mistakes of others. We cannot afford to spend such great resources on marketing activities that may not bring the desired effect to the project. Crypto people are often aware of Cardanos advantages. but these benefits are often overlooked or misunderstood. Marketing is often based on simple and limited messages. Cardano requires deeper understanding from everyone. I believe that we. as an ecosystem. emphasizes decentralization and highlights its advantages in our marketing efforts. Perhaps we should consider supporting quality content creators to achieve this. Another problem is that the media have reported negative about Cardano until recently. although this seems to be improved. I do not believe marketing will solve this problem. It is really useful is to produce tangible results - the projects are operating successfully in reality. This leads us back to the network effect. strengthened by the fact that businesses. banks and government applications. On the X platform. the best marketing for Cardano is a strong and loyal community. We can win many polls and every positive article about Cardano has received many views and likes. Negative articles are full of comments that disagree. all thanks to the efforts of the community without wasting. This approach works well. Be persistent and focus on building bridges instead of burning them. Cardano needs to better show its technology. Introducing Hydra through playing Doom is a great idea. creating enthusiastic posts on social networks in Rare Evo and it is relatively cheap. Cardano has more things to provide. the police in Dubai launched a pilot project using Cardano to investigate criminals. It works well with the ability to expand the current cardano. We need to implement similar projects and present them smartly. The direct contact of Cardano Foundation. IOG and Emurgo with businesses. banks and government plays an important role in the success of the project rather than marketing. Cardano entities can help them build large projects.',\n",
       " ' Intersect has a few working groups. Please support these more efforts. The founding units are tasked with supporting the Cardano ecosystem. Cardano Fund owns Cardano brand. They invest in the ecosystem. thereby preserving ADA in the budget. Although it is important to praise these units for their clear achievements. sometimes encouraging them to increase their activities is also essential. The expected income to enter the budget by 2025 is 300 million ADA. We can allocate about 10 million ADA for marketing activities. up to 30 million ADA. It is important to choose marketing strategies to ensure the number of new users can be measured. such as direct marketing. With limited income. we are not more likely to make mistakes and have to choose the best solution. ideally from some options. In the medium term. Cardanos main mission will be to build a long -term value that people will explore. appreciate and stick. Once we have it. we can consider marketing.September 6. With freedom associated with responsibility. After Hardver Chang. the community won the Cardano budget control. There are proposals to burn ADA in the budget. but this will be a serious mistake. Instead of burning. we should invest in a wisely ADA in the ecosystem to create new values. It is important to invest in building a strong network effect. We must not burn an ADA. Some people recommend burning ADA from the budget. but it will be a terrible mistake. This will remove ADA from the total supply. Ada will not be used anymore. They will never be put into circulation. that means making these tokens unable to use. About 3. 3% of the total ADA supply is in the budget. Burning a small amount of these tokens may have a short -term impact on the price of ADA. but the long -term impact on the price will not be significant. The same thing will happen if all the money in the budget is burned. In the short term. this can lead to speculation. During the ICO fever. some projects have burned tokens to increase the market price. which often leads to a sharp decrease in value. no projects do that way that exists. I think such a notice will have a minimum impact on the market behavior at this time. And what about the long -term impact? In general. scarcity can increase the market price of a property. the need is always essential. Crypto demand increases with utilities. Cardano must be helpful for everyone. We must build a strong network effect. This will support the needs of ADA. Digital scarcity is not necessarily promoting demand. when combined with utilities or other factors that create demand. it can significantly increase Adas market price in the long run. Another factor that promotes needs can be a story. Digital scarcity has a good effect on Bitcoin. where people are not sure the utilities or network effects directly. Reporting of value storage is sufficient for them. this will not work in the same way for Cardano.',\n",
       " ' For Cardano to be successful. it needs to be one of the dominant smart contract platforms. And our ecosystem must focus on utilities. We need to invest to build a strong network effect and ADA in the budget can be used for this purpose. Consider what we can achieve with 1. We can launch some more Catalyst funds. use ADA to liquidity in DEFI. accelerate the development of technologies that can expand. sponsor the deployment of USDC and USDT on Cardano and even invest in marketing. Cardano ecosystem needs to solve a number of problems. including low liquidity in the DEFI ecosystem. low expansion capacity and the absence of large stablecoins. It should be noted that more new projects solve these challenges by keeping a large amount of tokens and investing them strategically. They pay for developers. pump money into DEFI. pay for Circle and Tether to deploy stablecoin on their blockchain. invest heavily in marketing and even pay for influential people. They are willing to spend a large amount of tokens for VC funds. they talked well about the project because they were pumped tokens into their pockets. Another impact is that VC funds are ready to invest in building applications in the ecosystem they have invested in tokens. This approach supports their investment growth. They bought cheap money from the group and wanted to sell them later when the ecosystem mature. Logically. the ready to invest in the development of the less attractive Cardano ecosystem for VC funds. They have no chance to buy ada at a cheap price. The three founding units of Cardano decided not to use the budget fund for these purposes and left those decisions for the community. VC funds have been deliberately eliminated from the original ADA distribution process. There are countless ways to use ADA to ensure the success of Cardano. The worst thing we can do is destroying resources that can sponsor these initiatives. ADA is a scarce resource. with a maximum supply of 45 billion coins. Like Bitcoin. Cardano has no infinite token inflation. Cardano does not need to burn coins. the circulating economy should develop. Ada burned will never be put into circulation again. For projects with infinite inflation. burning a part is reasonable. Projects can burn all the collected fees. Cardano has no inflation so it is not necessary to burn coins. Even if we consider burning transaction fees. it will not be smart. because the fee is a source of income for the budget and providing Stake rewards including SPO rewards. Are we sure the Stake will be satisfied with the lower Stake reward? And operators (SPO). who need to cover the operating costs of the pools. how will it react? We do not forget the income in the budget. We may consider reducing supply. thus increasing scarcity. which can have a positive impact on ADAs market prices. this discussion will take place when Cardano has established a strong network effect. Because this is not the current reality.',\n",
       " ' these debates are too early and have no meaning at this time. In addition to the fee. the main source of income of the budget is ADA in the reserve. a total of about 7. 8 billion ADA. In this amount. about 20%—or about 1. 56 billion ADA - will be gradually transferred to the budget. If we now burn 1. it will take many years to accumulate the same amount into the budget. we will have limited investment capital. The expected budget income is about 300 million ADA by 2025. this income is expected to decrease in the following years. ADA in the budget represents a financial value that can be converted into other values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bthat benefit the ecosystem. We should see this as an opportunity to invest wisely in the ecosystem. ensuring that some ADAs are returned or the value collected significantly contributed to our success. it will not make any sense when considering giving ADA from the budget or selling it at a cheap price for VC funds. The budget should operate as our own VC fund. Cardano must be an ideal and independent ecosystem with external capital and do not need to allow VC funds to reduce their holding amounts to ADA holders. Before the rapid success of competition chains. this could be a more challenging path. but it was the way we chose. ADA serves as a resource for decentralization. It is necessary not only for block production but also management on-chain. where it is used to vote on the future of the project. The fact that VC funds holding the right to issue important decisions is meaningless. Cardanos original token distribution has benefited the community. We are never burned even if only one ADA from the budget. Consider ADA as a scarce resource that we can use strategically to promote the development of the ecosystem. I am sure that CC members will never approve the burning of ADA in the budget. It will go against the sustainable principle or maybe some other principles. Perhaps we should put the budget ban on the Cardano Constitution clearly.September 3. Hardkork Chang marks the beginning of a self -maintaining era and towards the community of Cardano. With genesis courses expired. the group is planning to publish them to emphasize their unrelated. Although on-chain administration is very important for real decentralization. it is often misunderstood or ignored. Real independence to any leader or group guarantees the community that they have full control of the future of the system they contribute. On September 1. Cardano was born. The hardfork complex (Hardver Combinator) trigger HardFork Chang at the beginning of Epoch 507. While Chang is widely praised on social networks for introducing the first phase (Chang #1) of On-Chain Administration. other important upgrades will not be missed. Developers are particularly excited with the Plutus V3. the version will introduce the advanced Zero-Knowledge password. Like every hardfork. the coordination of efforts of pool operators. trading floors. wallet developers and DEFI application developers is essential.',\n",
       " ' Despite a delay. Hardver was successfully activated. marking the final use of the genesis courses. The Hardver Chang version. deployed CIP-1694. marked a significant change towards a decentralized management model and towards the community more. bringing Cardano into the Voltaire era. This cip sketched the Cardano Administration transformation process from founding units - Input Output. Cardano Fund and Emurgo - Cardano community. Since the beginning of 2023. the community has actively discussed and voted to CIP-1694. making it the most controversial and commented in Cardanos history. Giving up control of a project may be a challenge for founding units. In the case of Cardano. these entities handed over the control of the fund to hold more than 1. 5 billion ADA to the community. like many other blockchains. faced criticism for having a clear leader. Although Charles Hoskinson is only the CEO of IOG and the production of blocks has been completely controlled by the community. he is often criticized for being considered as the leader of Cardano. Charles Hoskinson has never had a ‘stop’ button to stop blockchain Cardano. When IOG releases the new version of Node. the pool operator and the community can choose to accept or ignore it. In this respect. Cardanos upgrade is always similar to Bitcoin. The main difference is that instead of the hard -block number of hardfork in the source code. Cardano requires HardFork to be activated through genesis locks. These courses can also be transferred from the budget. as seen with the Catalyst fund and modify some protocol parameters. A decentralized project management is still a misunderstood topic. With genesis keys that are no longer suitable. it is important to consider the influence that Charles Hoskinson and the founding units still have for the project. Currently there is a completely firm thing: If you believe that the SEC cannot issue a court command to close the internet for anyone who has the control of Bitcoin. the same thing is currently applied to Cardano. Charles Hoskinson is still alive and IOG. Cardano Foundation and Emurgo still exists. their current role is similar to the role of all ADA holders. Through administrative agencies. the community will decide to activate hardfork. amend the protocol parameters or withdraw ADA from the budget. The influence of blockchain leaders is often exaggerated and obscured by false stories. A decentralization is a major feature of any blockchain project. Blockchain is a technology that requires someone to build it. set the original rules and then start it with other volunteers. In 2009. the Anonymous Creator Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin. On August 15. 2010. Bitcoin faced a major threat when an unknown hacker created 184.467 billion BTC unexpectedly. an event called a value overflow. Satoshi. along with another developer. Gavin Andresen. quickly deployed a hardfork to remove excess BTC. saving Bitcoin from early collapse. At the end of 2010. Satoshi left the Bitcoin community. handed over the control of Bitcoin source storage and online warning lock to Gavin Andresen. This conversion process has made Andresen a main developer.',\n",
       " ' responsible for managing the project development and coordinating the contribution of other developers. The departure of Satoshi led to the misconception that blockchain projects were not hidden by leaders or leaders to avoid government intervention. Some even believe that no one should hold the Github key or coordinate the development. Despite the departure of Satoshi. Gavin Andresen still fully takes on his role. including solving important issues such as overflow incidents. The transfer of this responsibility continuously and never ended. The leader may be a celebrity. who regularly discusses a project or the whole industry. or a person who is always behind the scenes. Instead of a single leader. a small group of core developers can hold a significant influence. Although a project does not need to be transparent about the person who holds the main decision. it should not be confused with non -transparency with decentralization. Anonymous can sometimes hide the dictatorship and absolute control of the project. The disclosure of detailed information about leadership may not always be considered beneficial. Each blockchain requires some forms of governance. whether it is a leader. a group or a larger community. to ensure its proper operation and development. If a blockchain protocol does not have a group or allows people to act independently. it may cause people to leave the project. In the event of a serious incident. timely corrections may not be provided or may appear many incompatible solutions. Long -term. challenging problems may not be solved or lack of adequate support. the question is not that there should be a leader or a group. but how to ensure that the project control is actually decentralized. This means putting it in many independent entities that can achieve a consensus mechanism. even if not everyone agrees. The answer is on-chain administration. Chang #1 Introducing the management capabilities for Blockchain Cardano as stated in the proposal to improve Cardano CIP-1694. Immediately after the hardfork. individuals who were interested in governance began to register as Dreps. Ada holders began authorizing their decision to make these dreps. We are currently in the startup stage. The vote of members of the Constitutional Committee took place a while ago and they are currently preparing for management with the support of Intersect. Charles Hoskinson is still the CEO of IOG. The next time IOG provides an incompatible node version that requires the operation of HarFork CombINATOR. accepting it will not only depend on SPO and other important infrastructure nodes but also depending on the vote of Dreps. CC and SPO members. It will not be enough if only the new version of the Node is installed and depends on the founding entities to sign the HardFork activation transaction. Dreps must also agree with HardFork and CC members to ensure that this change is consistent with the constitution. No change. including amendments to the protocol parameter or withdrawing ADA from the budget. may occur without the approval of the administrator. This marks a change compared to the money period when the founding units need to use the genesis key.',\n",
       " ' 7 Genesis locks have been replaced by multiple locks held by CC. Dreps and SPO members. The next step in governance is the Cardano Constitution. a necessary move towards full-chain management. This must be done within 90 days. Off-chain administration is a more concentrated approach. in which decisions are made on off-chain. usually by a small group of developers or stakeholders. Although this may be more effective. it can also lead to power concentration and decrease the decentralization of the network. Cardanos on-chain management model is a significant start compared to more concentrated approaches used by other blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This decentralized approach empowered the community to shape the future of the network and promote more fair distribution. Although Bitcoin does not have an official online voting mechanism like Cardano. miners can be considered an indirect vote in the direction of the network through their actions. This is often called voting at the ratio of the hash. Although the action of the miner can affect the direction of the network. it is not the direct voting process on-chain. There is no official mechanism to propose and vote specific changes. Voting the ratio of hash like a form of indirect management. in which the most exploitation power will determine the direction of the network. It is not as clear or formal as on-chain management mechanisms. It is possible to argue that the process of proposing Bitcoin improvement (BIP) is an official mechanism to propose and discuss changes to the Bitcoin protocol. although it is an important part of the development of the network. it is still considered as off-chain administration. Although BIP is proposed and discussed publicly. the final decision on whether whether to deploy BIP or not is largely determined by Core Devs and miners. The core developer must deploy changes or accept that change if someone is not that they make that change. The exploitation has the right to accept or reject new rules by adding or eliminating them in the blocks they exploit. The BIP process is not related to the official voting mechanism on-chain. where the owner of the token can directly express their interests. it is a cooperation process in which developers. miners and other stakeholders discuss and debate the proposed changes. although the BIP process is an important part of Bitcoin governance. it is still considered as off-chain administration because the final decision making right belongs to operators and markets. The management model of Bitcoin is a combination of off-chain mechanisms such as bip process and on-chain elements such as voting at the ratio of hash. Although this approach has served Bitcoin well. it also limits the decentralization and community participation compared to Cardanos On-Chain Administration model introduced by HardFork Chang. Satoshi has imagined a form of on-chain management where each user will have the right to make decisions. In Bitcoin White Book. he wrote:. The evidence of the job also solves the problem of determining the representation of the majority of decisions.',\n",
       " ' If the majority is based on a vote of an IP address. it can be overthrown by anyone who can allocate multiple IPs. Evidence is basically a CPU a vote. Satoshi assumes that people who hold the organizers will also be the exploitation. so the CPU votes. the bip process was only introduced after the departure of Satoshi. highlighting a hole in his assumption. It can be said that Cardano will achieve what Satoshi has envisioned Bitcoin. The increase of expensive and noisy ASIC exploitation tools has prevented a significant part of the organizers holding the BTC with the right to make significant decisions. Hardver Chang allows the owner to control Cardano. No management model is good or bad. If the community understands and agrees with a certain management model. recognizing its strengths and weaknesses. that model can operate effectively. a model may be considered inactive if a significant part of the community requires changes or solving problems that exist in the long term. On-chain Adventure Adventure to the territory has not been discovered and many potential challenges for the cardano community. A concern is the influence of ADA whales. species that can dominate the decisions of significant voting management. Whether this causes a problem or not. it is still necessary to consider. this issue is similar to the significant impact of major mining companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The best solution is to have a diverse group of whale with different views. The disagreements between whales will improve the voting rights of smaller dreps. One of the main advantages of On-Chain Administration is the ability to gradually make changes based on the communitys wishes. If Ada holders feel helpless in implementing the desired changes. they can leave the ecosystem. This scenario is also unwanted for whales because it will reduce their wealth. whales are forced to consider the desire of the community to a certain extent. The main objective of ON-CHAIN \\\\u200b\\\\u200bis to allow continuous development. Cardano must progress in technology to maintain competitiveness and serve the community effectively. The community must maintain the decentralized infrastructure control they choose to use.August 31. The HardFork Chang Cardano will take place on Sunday 1 September at 21:44 UTC. In recent video messages. enter | Outputs Charles Hoskinson raised Hardvers importance at an iconic venue - Jackson Hole - where he was attending the Salt conference. This Wyoming resort is famous for three reasons: skiing in the winter. salmon fishing in the summer and annual gathering of central bank officials since 1982. The location was chosen to attract Paul A. Volcker. then the President of the Federal Reserve of the United States and was an artificial fishing fleet. Jackson Hole moved from the financial page to the first page of the world press in the emerging financial crisis in 2007. bankers. economists. government representatives and others have considered monetary policies. such as quantitative loosening and other reactions to the recession. In other parts of the world. these crises have caused a very different reaction - the 2008 Bitcoin definition article by Satoshi Nakamoto.',\n",
       " ' That article has changed Hoskinsons life. And his reaction - Blockchain Cardano and academic and technical infrastructure as the foundation for it - is also changing the way the world operates. Here are the edited excerpts from Hoskinsons video about the HardFork Chang version. its importance to Cardano and the future it can warn. A decentralization and the concept of good money are always the foundation of Crypto. Another platform is the idea that many managers for many people. instead of a few. With Blockchain. we have no leaders; Instead. we all become a community and decide to do everything. Building a decentralized government to run Cardano in the coming decades is a great challenge. we have tried to create the Voltaire era with many people in more than 25 countries. Proposing the improvement of Cardano CIP-1694. giving a technical design of a minimum feasible government for the Voltaire system. It is the beginning of something that will bloom into thousands of flowers and thousands of approaches. This takes a lot of time and effort of many people. so many people can thank individually. But thanks to their efforts. the world will be a bit different after the hardfork chang deployed CIP-1694. The hardfork to make new era is easy on Cardano. We did that to Vasil. we did it with Alonzo and once again with Shelley. But Chang is the upgrade that brings the largest results because it unlocked the most advanced rule in the history of the crypto industry. It combines concepts as flexible democracy with the constitutional republic. HarFork chang allows strong organizations to operate through the budget or route. it also unlocked Cardanos jewel - a sovereign asset worth 1. 5 billion ADA worth nearly 600 million dollars today. This is a really extraordinary thing used by and for each of the millions of Cardano ecosystems. It was surprising that many people did not know each other. never even met. now will work together through Blockchain and make decisions that its consequences will spread in world history. The future of countries and trade. in some way. can be influenced by what we do as a community. In the world of Cardano. technology is really extraordinary application. Cardano is famous for being the most reliable blockchain besides Bitcoin. This is very important because if people plan to build the economic. political and social system in the future of the world. they must build on the basis. They should be built on granite. not sandy sand. We had to do everything in a difficult way as an ecosystem. sometimes having to accept criticisms of colleagues. Sometimes. we are not the first to market but we will always be the best in the market and the administration is no exception. By unlocking the capabilities of millions of people and their representatives to sit back and think where we should go. we can solve the difficult problems together that Cardano is facing. How do we market and brand Cardano ecosystem? How do we communicate us? How do we find funding for important projects that are not loved by venture capital? How do we ensure that the best developers and scientists continue to find funding to bring this platform to a new level? And where to go? These are difficult and decisive questions that cannot be raised by any individual.',\n",
       " ' company or leader but only the collective will of an ecosystem. The purpose of Voltaire is to exploit. synthesize and tweak that collective will into a clear voice - despite our decentralization - about where to go and go there. In fact. no one is smarter than everyone. No matter how talented or ethical the founder will win. we will win because Voltaire gathered the whole collective intelligence of the whole. This is the promise and miracle of an on-chain administration and what we will show is our unique path ahead. I am proud of that. I am proud of many of you who have spent a lot of time working without anything. You volunteer. you appear and no one has to tell you to do it. You just wake up in the morning and say I can make a difference. I am a part of something bigger than myself and I believe that the work we do here is not only for us but also for the whole world. I would like to thank each of you for spending time participating in seminars. Voltaire forums. online and directly in the past two years. we will be able to receive a new era. the beginning of a journey to bring us to the highest peaks. Cardano was built to see the world in decades and centuries. in stark contrast to the blockchain industry growing rapidly and breaking everything around us. We are not particularly interested in the ups and downs in the market because we are still here. Time and time. we have proven that we make the best decisions. Even though this is the first time to market the Stake feature without liquidity. which people are currently trying to copy; Or Hydra Doom shows how far we can go by using the power of the expanded UTXO model (EUTXO) in combination with state channels. Software engineers highly appreciate how easy Rollups on Eutxo. as we have seen with Zero-Knowledge investment projects. from our Partnerchain model and with all the things that are about to debut with Input Endorsers. Every step. our decisions are guided by research documents - 210 and continues to increase - written by 168 scientists and countless engineers from South America to Japan. we can combine that incredible innovation and technique with the team of people of the administrator. who are ready and enthusiastic to help us take us to the place we need. there have been mistakes that have happened in the past 10 years. There have been missed opportunities. the items in the roadmap should have been prioritized in different ways. But there is no project is no mistake. The power of decentralized management is that we have the right to recognize such things and we know how to take advantage of those failures to be able to pursue more wiser and better business activities. The ability to overcome mistakes. achieve wisdom and learn to develop is a unique competitive advantage. We are not attracted to the dogma or the ego of the founder.',\n",
       " ' We are not attracted to the desire to pursue frivolous. we are here to do the right thing. We want the world to be better. We want this to be a better place for everyone to live. We want to realize the vision of Satoshi. When he wrote his landmark article in 2008. Bitcoin was a social contract. It is a direction for the future of mankind. It is not the end but the beginning of the story. We picked up the flag and continued to carry it. We not only make progress but deep in the industry also rely on us to have leadership because following this path is very difficult. It is not sexy. it is not glorious. leaders face criticism. despise and stagnation daily. But in the long run. we will pioneer in a world where each person is really equal and has a fair consideration based on algorithm management. At the end of this century. all economic. political and social systems can be impacted by blockchain. And if we continue on our way. that blockchain will be Cardano. The world will continue to operate because it is legitimate and right. The fact that we are willing to endure the journey we can reach the top. As the co -founder of Cardano with Jeremy Wood. I am proud that you have been with this project for a long time. It was difficult. but it was fun. After Chang. I am still here. but like you. I will only be another member of the community. There is no special charles. That is the truth of decentralization. And that is the reality and nature of a structure that still exists here because it can exist after losing the founders. It may exist when the founders make mistakes. It can survive bad routes. We will wake up in the future when we know that Cardano organizations are very strong and strong. And we will know that tomorrow will be better tomorrow. I went to 74 countries to pursue my Cardano dream. I met tens of thousands of people and I saw passion. enthusiasm. and joy. I was very eager to reach 100 countries in the next decade and I was eager to see Cardano running nations. We will turn that into reality and we will turn that happen together as equality. And thank you all - and welcome to the era of Voltaire. PS: The HarFork Chang upgrade is named for gratitude to Phil Chang of Input Output. who suddenly died in 2022. The significant contributions of Phil Chang to Cardanos important strategies and the concept of Voltaire have left a long -term impact. I often heard that Cardano lacked a convincing story in this cycle. Cardano is a project aimed at the mission and does not need new stories. Its mission is still consistent: Becoming a global financial and social operating system. This mission is gradually being realized. People may be impatient and can expect faster progress. They may not understand that Blockchain is a breakthrough technology and is hard to achieve a high level of application for the first 10 to 20 years.',\n",
       " ' Be loyal to the projects mission and decentralized principles. This will lead us to success. New stories. whatever they may be. only work in a short time. When NFT becomes popular. everyone wants their favorite blockchain to become the leading NFT platform. If the meme is tending. the goal will turn to become the best exploitation platform with high TPS. In this price increase. building a new DEX platform or lending is no longer a trend. Why not create a new layer 2 and promise users about the AirDrops they want? In fact. I think investors are focusing on Depin projects. NFT. 2nd grade solution and Depin projects significantly promote blockchain application. It is great to see these progress. in the price market. stories or excitement often forms around them. leading to bubbles and will eventually break. What happens when the price increases end? Most people will not care. because they may not be able to stay in the market for the next long and challenging price. and many Crypto projects will not exist. Dont worry. we will think of new stories for the next cycle. Cardano does not need new stories that way. Cardano is a project aiming at a clear goal: Becoming a global social and social operating system. This is the core story of the project. Is that not enough?. the project must meet a number of main criteria. it must be decentralized. ensuring DEFI is safe for users. it must be able to evolve. meaning it needs to be economic sustainability in the long term. This not only includes the collected fees but also includes decentralized management and funding for research and development. To achieve this goal requires the persistent efforts of the whole group and the community. It is not something that can be achieved in just one or two price increase cycles. but to some extent. artificial events caused by the Halving Bitcoin event. I understand that investors talk about crypto. but they may be just short -term speculators. Investors really focus on the basic principles and future potential of a project. In the crypto industry. there are often not only investors but also those who value decentralization and consider blockchain as an opportunity to change society. While for many people. the crypto industry seems to be similar to pure speculation. the success is really associated with the application and use of decentralized principles. In the recent price market. Cardano lacks DEFI ecosystem. Currently there are many impressive projects. The cognitive challenge is that Defi does not ride on an exaggeration wave. as this is often considered obvious. DEFI is still the most valuable blockchain application so far. If you change the viewing angle. you will see Cardano are making significant steps on technological progress. In the early years of Bitcoin. there is concern that people will not accept decentralization or will be alert to the self -management wallet. these concerns have been somewhat authentic when many people use the depository service or Layer 2 concentrated.',\n",
       " ' Does this mean the blockchain failed? Perhaps that simply means that the application of decentralized services will take more time. You often see the comparison between internet application speed and blockchain application. At first glance. the application of blockchain seems to be progressing at the same speed as the internet application. which sounds promising. But there is a disadvantage. These comparisons have a mistake. They count all users of Blockchain wallets. including those holding crypto on the exchange. The number of self -deposited wallpapers is less than tens of millions. If we consider Blockchain users to be a self -management wallet. the Blockchain application speed is actually more than 10 times slower than the Internet application speed. What does this mean? That means we are still at the early stages of blockchain application. Most people are holders. not active users. The blockchain industry lacks direct network effects. this is a challenge for all blockchain projects. not only Cardano. Although some people think that Hodling is calculated as a level of use. it is important to understand that no blockchain can be economically sustainable if there is no direct network effect. there is no transaction fee. The lack of active users is a problem for Cardano as well as many other blockchains. Can this problem be solved by a short -term story about a price increase cycle? Definitely no. Can a decentralized decentralized network be replaced by a centralized network or gathered Layer 2? Basically no. because the concentration will certainly lead to intermediaries abusing power. The only solution is to continue building a global decentralized operating system that will eventually be applied by millions of people. Everyone is naturally attracted to the best technology available. Although this may not always be the most decentralized choice. decentralized will still play an important role. Users will seek the best overall experience. not only including TPS but also security. user interface. available services. fee. When it comes to application. there is no clear winner of the blockchain. Projects with higher market capitalization are not sure to reflect superior technology. The market is common inertia and manipulation. Projects you have never heard of can easily reach the top 10. usually due to short -term manipulation or storytelling. Whales predict the market price and try to take advantage of them. the winner will be determined based on the network effect. which must last for several years. No project has achieved this. When the market price comes down to attack. users tend to leave. there are no absolute winners. I somewhat agrees that Cardano as a platform will face challenges if Adas market price does not grow. there is no simple solution if we want to avoid market manipulation like other projects. Is pumping fake liquidity or using BOT to create unnecessary transactions to make the network seem more positive? Or the exaggeration of ADAs market price is easier because people often believe that if the numbers increase. the project will definitely be good? I dont think it is an appropriate solution.',\n",
       " ' I believe that the best approach is to continue building and adhering to decentralized principles. Cardano does not need to compete with other projects on market capitalization. The goal is to provide quality technology. Market capitalization must be proved by superior technology. I do not believe that false reports can decide the winner in the long run. People with influence can say that the market capitalization reflects the interest and quality of a project. this is true for technologies with high acceptance rates. the application of Blockchain is still in the early stage. When blockchains have long -term blocks. it will become clear that blocks can best handle the user line. And perhaps the best way to act is to ignore frivolous talk and continue to build. We do not need to worry that Cardano is currently not attractive to investors. They will come when they see a strong network effect. Our long -term goal is to attract users. Provide Ouroboros Leios and integrate closer Hydra rather than the necessary steps. Users will search for utilities that can only be built if sponsored. ADA in the budget may not be enough to finance the projects and build the necessary infrastructure. Cardano should attract VC investors. Explaining Cardanos benefits to venture capitalists must be one of our short -term goals. Cardano Foundation and Emurgo are becoming more active in this field. this is good. We all know that on-chain administration is essential for a decentralized project. some people think that it is not attractive enough for users or investors. The fact is that many people do not fully understand the decentralized concept. Do not expect them to grasp the importance of on-chain management immediately. Most of about 600 million people hold crypto hold their properties on the exchanges. Do not expect them to participate in management. The inactive administration will negatively affect blockchain. It is often said that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are clogged. Groups may intentionally avoid improving the ability to expand the Layer 1 size because they are compensated worthy of supporting Layer 2 ecosystem. Bitcoins concentration problems cannot be solved. The story of the reputation is boring. especially when inflation rises again after the application of Blob trading. I dont want to focus on the problems of other projects. I want to emphasize the importance of decentralized management in the long run. It is important to learn from the mistakes of old projects. It is often said that Cardano grows slowly but it is subjective. Cardano features a liquidity stake. which many people. including Ethereum. are trying to copy. It is also highly decentralized compared to other top 10 projects. Cardano has never needed to restart and survived a DDOS attack. Although its DEFI ecosystem has less liquidity more than some other ecosystems. it has never encountered a large hack or wallet. Expanding the scale through layer 2 is increasingly problematic and cannot be the only solution. The ability to expand Layer 1 is essential for all blockchains.',\n",
       " ' Doom on Hydra has proven the reality of more than 7000 TPS. Cardano will combine the Zero-Knowledge password. allowing the creation of the Zero-Knowledge Rollup. Cardano will soon expand the scale effectively on both layer 1 and layer 2. To a certain extent. TPS is just a story in this price increase market. TPS is very important to succeed because it is necessary to achieve high network effects. it is not necessarily high TPS as soon as the demand of users is still increasing. It is important to achieve high TPS without affecting decentralization. The ability to expand must be achieved without having to restart the network regularly. This is the long -term goal of the entire crypto industry. I believe that Cardano is basically very good and the best path leading to success is to continue developing. In a growth market. influential people (KOL) often come up with stories because they are paid by Layer 1 or Defi groups. Observing how users think and interact with Blockchain are certainly very valuable. focusing on short -term stories is not effective. It is important to attract users based on solid basic factors because this will ensure they will stay. Stories come and go. but users are attracted to solid basic principles. which are more likely to stay longer.August 28. Although the Cardano Constitution has not been approved. there has been a proposal on how to allocate ADA from the budget and propose to adjust parameters to increase Stake rewards. which can reduce the income of the budget. Before administrators started to allow withdrawal from the budget. it was necessary to set up a strategic plan. The community needs budget clarity for the coming years. you will explore the expected income of the fund in the coming years and check the current expenses. This information is very important for administrators when making a decision on withdrawing ADA from the budget. Every 5 days. during the transition between the era. 20% (parameter t) is collected and 0. 3% (parameter ρ) from the reserve will be added to the budget. 80% are used to reward operators and Stake Pool. The protocol returns a significant part of ADA from the virtual currency back to the reserve because the conditions to pay the full stake rewards are not met. The impact of this will be explained later. Each era. Cardano charge from 30.000 to 90. with about 23. 5 million ADA is currently taken from the reserve fund. About 4. 7 million ADA was sent to the budget. The reserves are gradually exhausted. leading to less ada to the budget of each Epoch. Although the increase in the collected transaction fee has been predicted. this has not happened. Most ADA is used to stake rewards and transferred to the budget from the reserve fund. The only expenditure from the Cardano budget is the Catalyst project. with each fund that receives a subsidy of 50 million ADA. The pilot Fund1 was implemented in the fall of 2020 and the latest Fund12.',\n",
       " ' On average. 3-4 funds are held annually. If the benefit of 50 million ADA continues. the budget will spend about 200 million ADA by 2025. On all Catalyst funds. 223 million ADA has been allocated from the budget to support 1.639 projects. each project receives about 135. It is time to consider how many such projects we want to support every year. If the protocol parameters do not change. the income into the budget on each Epoch will follow this model. Please note that this is only an estimate. When the budget runs out over time. the income will also decrease. For example: In early 2024. the income per Epoch was 3. 6 million ADA. by the end of the year. it has dropped to 3 million ADA. Fortunately. the reserves are slower than (green line) compared to the initial prediction (red line). Lower stake rewards and a part of ADA are returned to each Epoch. This now seems to be an advantage. More actual income for budget on each Epoch is expected as follows. This means that in early 2024. the income per Epoch was 5 million ADA. it will be reduced to 4. 4 million ADA. the income for the fund from the issuance of new money is expected to be about 300 million ADA. By the end of 2025. the income will reach about 3. 8 million ADA each Epoch. For transaction fees. we can predict about 2 million to 10 million ADA. The priority of the Cardano community is to sponsor projects to increase the number of fees collected. The fee needs to become a more important part of the funds income as soon as possible. ideally increasing 10 times in the next 5 years. this will not be technically feasible until the Ouroboros Leios is implemented. It is important to avoid expenses exceeding income. Suppose Catalyst continues to manage 4 annual funds or allowances for each fund to increase. we will remain about 100 million ADA for additional costs. By 2029. Catalysts sponsorship in the same way will no longer be feasible without the risk of deficit. I think that after the on-chain administration is established. Catalyst will need to apply for spending approval. The cardano community can choose to adjust the allowance of Catalyst. An important factor that needs to be considered for ADAs expenses is the market price of token in USD. The higher the market price of ADA. the less ADA needs to pay. such as $ 1 million. If ADAs market price is 0. 33 USD. 3 million ADA will need to withdraw from the budget. if ADAs market price is $ 2. it only needs 500.000 ADA to cover the same amount. These are significant differences. People will always convert their costs to USD (or other fiat currency). the more projects or ideas can be funded by the fund. it is currently impossible to predict the market in the next 5-10 years. The amount of ADA in the budget is always the concern of the cardano community.',\n",
       " ' There are considerations to reward Dreps. if we pay 500 dreps (2.000 ADA) per month. the budget will have to pay 12 million ada every year. That number will account for about 4% of the annual income until 2025. It should be noted that the income from the reserve fund will decrease each year. We can also consider allocating capital for projects that will create ADA for the budget after completion. we can support DEFI projects or enterprises to allocate parts not only for their groups (and token owners) but also for the Cardano budget. At least one part of ADA must be used as a loan. not sure to pay for projects that have an uncertain effect on Cardano. we can support attractive projects and increase the possibility of some ADAs will be returned. It is important to remember that the Cardano fund is not endless resources and we must manage it appropriately. Some ADAs can be used as collateral to make regular profits. Some people think that the fund can hold Stablecoin or even BTC instead of ADA. this will require a large amount of ADA to get these assets. which will not be beneficial for Stake people. A better approach may be to take advantage of the Cardano Defi ecosystem to find attractive benefits. which can solve low liquidity problems. Higher spending can only be considered if the fee is increased. Dreps should be encouraged to make optimal decisions for the ecosystem. When the budget income decreases. their rewards may also decrease. if the protocol earns more money from the transaction fee. their reward may remain stable or even increase. After the On-Chain governance is deployed. many groups will search for ADA from the budget. We can see many suggestions that seem attractive. we cannot spend tens of millions of ada per month. We should definitely avoid paying large amounts of money but instead gradually proceed. based on careful analysis of increasing success. There is also a proposal to amend the parameter T. the increase in Stake rewards by reducing the income of the budget is definitely not feasible. The 20% allocation seems to be absolute minimum. Stake prizes can be enhanced by guiding the Stake people that the protocol priority is 500 completely saturated groups. Monetary policy change is an unacceptable shortcut. the Bitcoin ecosystem complies with the principle of immutable monetary policy. Perhaps we should also consider this approach.August 23. the Bitcoin and Cardano pools can work similarly. Ignoring the difference between POW and POS. it seems that the pool only creates blocks on behalf of the authorized person. the difference is significant. The Bitcoin protocol does not know about the existence of the pool. while the Cardano protocol tracks the number of pools that created at least one block for each Epoch and can encourage the economy of high quality mass production. Satoshi Nakamoto has designed Bitcoin to award rewards to those who solve the tasks that require high calculations. The miner competes to solve these tasks in each round.',\n",
       " ' The average blocking time of Bitcoin is 10 minutes. allowing the distribution of 144 daily rewards. With 10.000 people exploiting in the network. on average each operator will receive a reward about 70 days. Not all miners are equal; People with higher hash rates have the opportunity to earn a reward more often. while smaller miners are rewarded less often and have the opportunity to earn minimal rewards. The exploitation pool has solved this problem. By combining their hash ratio. many miners can work together in a pool. Pool operator. Runner Node full Bitcoin. creates new blocks and distributes the calculation tasks between miners. When the operator finds the solution. it will be sent to the Pool operator. this person will quickly distribute the block online to ensure the reward. This reward is then divided by the ratio for all participating miners. The first bitcoin mining pool was founded in 2010. the Bitcoin protocol itself has not changed and does not recognize the pools. It specifies the block rewards for the Pool executive address. then they will distribute the rewards in a manual way based on the contribution of the hash ratio of each mining. The protocol does not know about this distribution process. The establishment of Bitcoin mining pools is driven by a number of factors. including concerns about centralization and challenges that individual miners face. When Bitcoin became popular. large -scale mining companies (often significantly calculated) have dominated the network. The concentration of this exploitation power raises concerns about the concentration and potential impact on the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. The exploitation pool emerged as a solution to distribute more uniform rewards and encourage the participation of smaller miners. The exploitation pool provides a more stable reward line. even for smaller miners. Democratization pools. allowing small miners to participate effectively. Without pool. individual miners may have difficulty competing with large farms. They may not receive a reward for several years. which will force them to leave the mining business. The birth of the pools has created an imbalance in the network. Before the pools. many block manufacturers existed because the miners had to run their adequate (exploited) nodes. The concentration of Bitcoin exploitation is now focused on a relatively small amount of mining pools. which controls a significant part of the networks hash power. Although thousands of individually exploited companies. the concentration of exploitation power into some large pools can affect the overall decentralization of the network. The problem of focusing on exploitation has not been solved. While the pools have somewhat concealed the problem. entrepreneurs continue to create greater and bigger exploitation farms. These large -scale activities benefit from the economic scale. pushing smaller mining companies out of the market. Pool operators hold a much stronger position in the network than other (non -exploiting) nodes. Although operators are somewhat controlled by miners. history shows that miners often do not prioritize the quality of block production or decentralization. There have been cases where pool operators censored transactions without losing a significant part of the hash rates.',\n",
       " ' only about 25 block manufacturers in the Bitcoin network. with two pools dominating producing more than 50% of the blocks. Bitcoin protocol cannot evaluate decentralized quality or positively impact it. the responsibility to maintain decentralization belongs to Pool. Miner and the community. People are greedy and attracted by the leadership focused on the application. The problem with a small number of block manufacturers has not been resolved and has been overlooked for a while. The argument is often based on the assumption that the miner can respond promptly to potential attacks. Bitcoin protocol does not provide stronger security solutions. making the community depend on this assumption. we should not ignore the fact that big miners can collaborate with a pool to perform an attack. Large exploitation farms still cause real security risks. It was a very similar threat before the introduction of the pools. Imagine if the protocol can track the number of pools in the network. distribute the reward directly without relying on the pool operator and even encourages high quality decentralized decentralization. Cardano is designed to do it. IOG has learned from the mistakes of those who came before. Using Bitcoin as a model. they have carefully considered the best way to deploy pools and authorized processes for Cardano. Realizing that the Stake will create a similar concern as the exploitation and understand that not every staker can be a block manufacturer. the pool has integrated the awareness of combining directly into the Cardano protocol. This integration has opened up. Cardano can reward not only for pool operators but also for all Stake people. with the distribution of rewards for stake people independent from pool operators. Pool operators cannot continue to stake the reward belongs to the authorized person. Another significant advantage is that Cardano can encourage the optimal number of pools in the network and limit the growth of the number of pool shares on a certain scale (called saturated point). The parameter K determines the desired number of pools in the network. currently placed in 500. To achieve the maximum reward. the ideal scenario is accurate 500 Pool completely saturated. It will be more beneficial for the network if there is a small number of high quality pool operators. better paid than a large number of people who do not earn money from business activities. The balance between decentralized and block quality is essential. having the largest number of mass manufacturers may be desired. this can lead to longer mass diffusion time online. rewarding a large number of operators will lead to reducing the total reward for everyone. From a quality point of view. it will be more beneficial when there are less operating people who receive relatively high and consistent rewards. See how the protocol calculates the reward for pools to take into account saturation and other aspects. A pool with a relative committed stake (s) and a relative total stake (𝜎) earn a reward based on the following formula:. (R) representing the total number of rewards available for Epoch (will be explained later).',\n",
       " ' (𝑎₀) is the coefficient of commitment influence (currently 0. (𝑧₀ = 1/k) is a relative saturated pool size (currently 0. 2%). (s = min (s. 𝑧₀)) and (𝜎 = min (𝜎. 𝑧₀)) ia relative commitment and the total stake of the pool. limit at (𝑧₀). Hệ số bão hòa ( 𝑧₀ ) ngăn chặn sự hình thành các pool quá lớn. trong khi hệ số ảnh hưởng cam kết ( 𝑎₀ ) không khuyến khích các nhà khai thác stake lớn chia stake của họ thành nhiều pool. The splitting of pool can negatively affect the Nakamoto coefficient. as there will be fewer entities to control most Stake. Speak more clearly. the operator can manage multiple pools; The protocol cannot stop this. Stake people at least know which pool is operated by the same operator. And they can decide to authorize the only pool operators. The top 10 leading operators control 22% Stake. starting a double spending attack with a reasonable chance of success will be much more difficult than Bitcoin. where just a combination of two pools is enough. About 1200 pool operates in Cardano network to create at least one block per Epoch (5 days). eligible for them to receive Stake rewards. One reason why the Stake reward is lower than the original expected is the number of pools exceeding the requirements of the K parameter more than twice. Stake reward is about 2. 5% to 3%. which is about half of the maximum reward that can be available for each Epoch. In addition to the large number of pools in the network. other factors contribute to reducing the rewards including the small amount of money that the network has obtained. the missed blocks (in which the slot leader does not create blocks). slot battles (slot battle). too saturated and low commitments. The following chart illustrates the situation. The red line shows maximum rewards that may have. while the green line displays the actual rewards paid to the operator and the Stake. The source of exhausted reserves at a slower speed. which can be considered an advantage. In both Bitcoin and Cardano. the reward consists of two components: part of the reserve and a part of the fee. Most (99%) come from reserves. with negligible fees. Bitcoin rewards the miner for each exploited block. the fixed reward is 3.125 BTC plus all transaction fees. Diagram illustrates this process. There is a difference between Bitcoin and Cardano. Bitcoin has a fixed block reward for four years. after which the event reduces half will reduce half of the reward. Bitcoin could not reduce the reward due to low decentralization because it could not detect its decentralized level. Cardano does not require fixed rewards for each epoch. a defined amount will be taken from the reserve. representing the maximum bonus possible. this reward may be reduced based on the production of blocks per Epoch. Cardano can flexibly adjust the Stake reward to encourage economic behaviors. if a pool becomes too saturated.',\n",
       " ' its reward will be reduced. encouraging the authorized to convert the pool to maximize their rewards. when the ADA owner authorizes another pool. the change will take effect after a few days of delay. depending on the end of the Epoch. The protocol monitors all shares between Epoch transitions. which takes place every 5 days. Cardano creates snapshots used throughout the epoch. All changes made in Epoch will be reflected in the next snapshot. the bitcoin miner can convert the pool at any time and the changes will take effect immediately. This instantaneousness is the advantage in an ongoing attack. Periodically. a virtual jar filled with ADA each Epoch. This virtual jar has two streams of income and two spending streams. Income:. Expense:. The mechanism is adjusted by protocol parameters. New money issuance speed is set by parameter ρ. currently at 0. 3%. For each epoch. 3% of ADA is taken from the reserve and added virtual jars. The collected transaction fee may vary by epoch. increasing gradually according to the level of network use. The parameter T determines the percentage of the virtual currency allocated into the budget and the Stake reward. T is placed in 20%. meaning the remaining 80% leave the reward stake. In an epoch. the supply of circulation is still stable. including the tokens held by stakeholders and in the budget. Between periods. the supply of circulation increases when the ADA moves from reserves to circulation. The fund is increasing and all Stake (including SPO) receives Stake bonuses. Fees are only circulated and does not affect the issuance of new money. Cardano redistributes the collected fee between investors and budgets by parameter T. The supply of circulation does not increase exactly 0. 3% of the ADA per Epoch. Stake rewards are adjusted based on the performance of the pool. If the conditions for maximum rewards are not met. a significant part of ADA will return to the reserve fund. Cardano has the maximum potential reward ratio for block production in each epoch. If certain conditions are not met. only a part of the reward is paid. the rest will be transferred to the reserve fund. the protocol parameters will be managed by the community. This means the community. through administrative agencies. must agree with the change. it is possible to propose and approve the parameter change. increasing it to 1000. as described above. the parameter K is not only related to decentralized. Need to think about other aspects. Cardano protocol is aware of its decentralization and can calculate the reward to encourage economic behaviors. If the Stake wants a higher reward. they need to entrust their ADA in a better way to the protocols expectations. In order for Bitcoin to achieve a higher decentralization. the miners will need to authorize smaller pools. The two dominant pools currently provide a fee of zero. bringing strong economic motivation to miners and can contribute to concentration. Another possibility is that the operators of these dominant pools voluntarily reduce their hash rates by refusing new miners.',\n",
       " ' although this is unlikely. Bitcoin Core Pool can be inspired by Cardano and try to rewrite the Bitcoin protocol. Cardano has successfully maintained a high level of decentralization for more than three years. with a stable number of pools and investors. The main problem is the presence of many pool operators. but the community opinions are different. Some supporters of support for single pool operators. while others believe that certain entities are more deserved to be trusted. Although both Bitcoin and Cardano use the concepts of pool and authorization. the difference between their protocols is significant. In the case of Bitcoin. the pool appears after the protocol is deployed and even to this day. Bitcoin still does not know their existence. Many people still say that Miner has exploited a block. but in fact. the blocks are almost always created and published online by a pool. The operator can only solve the POW task for the bloc that the Pool operator has inserted the reward address. Cardano encourages operators and pool investors to achieve desired decentralization. This approach prevents the appearance of two (or even one) pool dominated in the ecosystem. Although theoretically appears two dominant multi -pool operators. it is difficult to imagine a large number of Stake people supporting such a script.August 20. At Rare Evo. attendees have the only chance to play Doom on Hydra. That can be done not only in the locality but also globally. The demand for this abnormal experience is so high that the capacity must increase from 65 to 138 Hydra Head. During the three -day event. tens of millions of transactions were processed. with the highest TPS recorded as 7.182. although it could be even higher. The Crypto community is currently stirring about Hydras potential and future. John Woods. Algorands CTO. tweeted: Doom running on Hydra is one of the most interesting things I have ever seen. Literally. each frame is a transaction. Charles Hoskinson proposed to set up a company like Lightning Labs for Hydra. Doom runs at 35 frames per second. The group has modified the game tool to create transactions after each frame. then this transaction is processed by smart contracts. At the beginning of the game. a new UTXO with the original game state has been created. Players can use UTXO to update the game status. with input information provided by Redemer . The authentication process ensures that the players position does not change more than 143 units from one frame to another. this is the maximum speed of the player. Due to time limitations. it is impossible to verify many events in the game. Each hydra head can handle hundreds of TPS and process transactions from many games at the same time. 65 Hydra Head was opened. but due to high demand. some players had to wait for a place. To meet this. the group increased the number of heads to 138. When a new player wants to start playing. he will be assigned to the least busiest hydra head.',\n",
       " ' This allows hundreds of players to play Doom in parallel. with each player creating 35 transactions per second. The highest TPS was recorded as 7. Tens of millions of transactions have been processed. up to several gigabytes data. because Hydra acts like the second layer. these transactions are handled off-chain. This means that the huge amount of data does not need to be stored on the Cardano blockchain. Hydra expands the scale horizontally. meaning that when the demand increases. the new hydra head can be opened to increase the overall capacity. This makes the number of players theoretically unlimited. Blockchain is not easy to expand. Adding more authentic nodes to the network does not increase the diabetes because it is often limited by the size of the block and the speed of block production. More nodes can even reduce the quality of block production because it sets higher requirements for consensus mechanisms. The Rare Evo event is a great marketing activity for Hydra as well as Cardano. The entire Crypto community stirred up Doom on Hydra over the weekend. People began to compare Hydra with Lightning Network. a similar solution in Bitcoin ecosystem. Although both networks are based on state channels. they differ in many ways. Charles Hoskinson was very happy with this experience. so he planned to hold a $ 100.000 tournament at Summit Cardano. A small group of developers worked on the demo for about two months and promised to improve or give new surprises at the time of Summit. Charles is also considering starting an initiative similar to Lightning Labs for Hydra. Lightning Labs. supported by major venture capital companies. is the leading company to develop Lightning Network. Charles imagine a similar entity for Hydra to accelerate development and introduce more features. Unlike Lightning Network. Hydra has equity channels. meaning it uses the same infrastructure as Cardano. including data formats. transactions and executing commands. Basically. Hydra can perform functions similar to Cardano with the same level of security. Similar libraries that groups used to build on Cardano can also be used when building applications for Hydra. The main difference lies in the consensus mechanism: Hydras consensus mechanism is based on the participants agreeing on a new Snapshot. While Lightning Network only allows two participants to open channels and exchange Satoshi. Hydra allows about a dozen participants to open Hydra Head and use all the Cardano features. This includes sending Cardano original assets (including Stablecoin) and executing the instructions. paving the way for DEFI on Hydra. In Lightning Network. users must open a new channel for each interaction with different users or rely on routing. this will incur small transaction fees. it is impossible to route between hydra head but the group plans to deploy this feature. users can escape Hydra Head without closing it thanks to a feature called an increased separation. Commitment to increase. allowing access to opened hydra head. is also being developed. This function is especially interesting when launching DEFI services on Hydra. where participants can enter or escape if needed.',\n",
       " ' Building DEFI services on Hydra can be a challenge because it can require many Hydra heads. which can divide users and capital. The ability to connect users and capital will depend on the characteristics of the protocol that allows connection of heads. groups can design a solution designed specifically for hydra to solve these challenges. This marks a significant difference compared to Lightning Network. the network does not inherit anything from the Bitcoin protocol. Lightning Network is basically a new network with data and transactions. and does not support the deposit of property outside the BTC or performing a smart contract. Although Bitcoin allows casting and sending tokens. it requires external protocols for these functions. The main strength of Hydra is flexibility. because it supports more than sending only one property and can connect more users. For groups that want to exchange large quantities of trading with each other. Hydra is the perfect solution. Some influential people suggest that Layer 2 is not an ideal expansion solution because many Layers 2 dominate in an ecosystem that may not be compatible with each other. This is evident in the Ethereum ecosystem. where it leads to fragmentation of users and capital. from the UX perspective. it is inconvenient because users have to enter the layer 2 clearly and determine which content and the amount to be transferred. many top 2 layers in the Ethereum ecosystem are concentrated. The ability to expand Layer 1 gives some advantages. such as no fragmentation of users or capital. Users only need a wallet and a network. ensuring direct connection to all the network participants. the expansion of the scale in Layer 1 has its disadvantages. All transactions are permanently stored on the blockchain and in public mode. which is not suitable for many cases of use. including payments that require privacy. Although blockchain can be enough to trade meme or airdrop. it is difficult to replace the current global payment networks. even Solana or blockchain with Sharding is not the brightest candidate. A continuous 1000 TPS processing network will produce a few dozen gigabytes daily data. making it impossible for users to download all of these data to their local computer. Although solutions such as sharding data on nodes. data cutting or storing references to data (similar to Ouroboros Leios) can be done. they have not been deployed. Keeping all payments. including micro -payments. on Blockchain is forever unrealistic. It will be more effective when handling off-chain payments in layer solutions like Hydra and only process the final payments on Layer 1. Trading in Layer 2 faster. cheaper and more efficient and gain privacy easier. A public storage blockchain all transactions can hardly be applied as a global payment network. Hydra allows each user to run their own hydra node. protecting their property if needed. Layer 2 in the Ethereum ecosystem does not allow users to participate in consensus and approve transactions. which can happen in Hydra Head. in the Lightning network. the percentage of users is not locked and the user is locked as 1: 8.',\n",
       " ' It will be very interesting to see what Hydras ratio will be like. Immediately after the light cardano workstation app is distributed. we can start thinking about Light Node for Hydra. Theoretically. a mobile application is sufficient for a payment system without trust. If Bitcoin focuses only on opening lightning channels for new users. it can bring 200 million people to participate in Lightning for a year. Although this is a significant number and can be considered a success. this assumption is not realistic. If the opening of the average Lightning channels accounts for only 20% of the block field. only 40 million people will participate each year. The problem is that if the blocks are full and high. users may have to pay higher transaction fees than the number of satoshi they want to switch to Lightning. The same logic also applies to Cardano and Hydra (although Cardano does not use a competitive fee calculation model). for Hydra to reach hundreds of millions of users. the deployment of Ouroboros Leios is essential. it is difficult to predict whether a decentralized global financial infrastructure will rely on layer 2 or a fragmented blockchain that can handle tens of thousands of TPS. like Hydra. Layer 2 has an advantage thanks to security features and the ability to avoid large data storage. In the web3. users will participate in many swap transactions. not just transfer value. buying encrypted tickets will put unnecessary storage burden on Blockchain. with Layer 2 solutions like Hydra. tickets can be easily exchanged for Stablecoin. used when checking the head and then all off-chain transactions may be forgotten. Many cases use similar to smart contract requirements. The future global infrastructure will not only include payments but also include P2P activities such as swapping. enhancing security and reliability as well as eliminating expensive intermediaries. Hydra is now ready for applications in the real world. It is time for the teams to start building Hydra.August 18. Hardver often brings confusion and chaos to users. but with Cardano is not. Thanks to Harfork Combinator. the movement to the new version takes place seamlessly and simply. The community eagerly predicted HardFork Chang and most of the Stake Pool operators (SPO) were prepared for it. The best thing for users is that they do not need to do anything with their property or wallet. The upgrade process will take place without restarting the network. ensuring only one version of Cardano and ADA after the hardfork. The goal of HardFork is to change the protocol rules in an inverted way. This means that the older version of the workstation (Node Cardano) cannot accurately handle the blocks created by the new workstation. Before the upgrade notice. all nodes in the network run the compatible workstation version. version 8. 0 can be used most widely. In the picture. you can see that before distributing the new version of the workstation. all operators run version 8. 0 or less. The group has prepared the new workstation version.',\n",
       " ' combined with the HardFork Chang version. Version 9. 0 Handling blocks like version 8. This means that after installing the upgrade. the new function will not be activated immediately. During the transition period. SPO needs to install a new workstation version. This process may take a few weeks or even a few months. During the entire time. all nodes must create compatible blocks. This stage is very important for decisive decisive processes. because Spo will be independent of the old version. Both IOG and Intersect are not mandatory that anyone who installs the new version. The real network is in the hands of the community. you can see a part of the operators upgrading nodes to the new version 9. 0 and part of them is still in version 8. All full node operators agree with changes to install a new version on their hardware. When the necessary number of operators has been upgraded. the conversion process may be activated by the genesis key. The network receives a signal to switch to an upgraded workstation version. in this case. version 9. The upgrade to the new version occurs during the transition between the era. This task is managed by the Hard-Fork complex. The Hard-Fork combination set is designed to streamline network updates without stopping or restarting. It achieves this by combining blocks before Fork and Post-Fork for a short transition period. maintaining a continuous blockchain. Instead of dividing into separate chains. the blocks are combined. ensuring the continuity of the user experience and preventing any network decline. The result is no blockchain division. Cardano has been upgraded and the entire ledger history is still intact. continuing in a single valid version. you can see red blocks that create nodes compatible with version 8. The first red vertical line indicates the activation of HardFork Chang. The second red vertical line is the time to activation upgrade. the blocks were created by nodes compatible with version 9. A hardfork can only be activated when the network and infrastructure are fully prepared. This requires most SPOs to upgrade (70%). The problem is not the number of nodes but also a stake (ada) needed to create blocks. In addition to pool operators. trading floors and DEFI infrastructure operators must also upgrade. Everyone must be able to access assets on the exchanges. By checking the blocks. you can easily determine which version of the node has created them. Anyone can check if the conditions to activate upgrade are responded. It is even possible to monitor the level of ready floors for HardFork Chang. Ada holders. Stake and Defi users do not need to take any special actions for the upcoming hardfork Chang. Unlike previous hardfork of Bitcoin or other blockchains. no need to transfer assets to exchanges. If you are using Daedalus wallet. you will receive a software upgrade when needed. Most of the most common hard wallets are ready for Chang. Most lightweight wallets will be ready. You can check the current state on Intersect.',\n",
       " ' For the Stake. the only action proposed to verify that your Stake Pool operator has upgraded to version 9. If they havent done so and you support Hardver Chang. you may want to ask about the delay. Some operators can verify changes. so it may take more time to upgrade. Be patient. For people with an open DEFI position. you should monitor the official social media channels of the projects you use. Projects may have been prepared for upgrades. but the update of information is always a good idea.August 15. statistics are often manipulated or presented without appropriate context. People who have influencing often share incorrect information or intentionally distort. a statement spread on the X platform yesterday that Solana has 1. 6 million user operating daily. while Cardano has only 20. Some influential people can argue that this means Solana is winning. it is not possible to determine the exact number of daily users for each blockchain. We will explain why in this article. most of the low -cost transactions are created by BOT. Older projects benefit from significant network effects and a large number of supporters. The crypto market is somewhat saturated and in the price market. the use of blockchain tends to decrease. leading to the number of users leaving. Competitive projects to win users. this is beneficial for the industry because it promotes innovation. some projects use unfair measures. presenting data using incorrect or no appropriate context. They can use BOT to increase the number of users or daily trading and capital to increase the total locked value (TVL) in a fake way. This behavior is often motivated by the desperate need to attract attention. feeling that they are falling behind in the competition for users. The media and distorted statistics can amplify their efforts. Some influential people are often paid by project groups. using this distorted data to try and affect the Crypto community. this tweet declares that Solana has 1. 6 million users daily. The other less known 2 -grade chains or solutions are also reported that they are working well. Cardano is displayed at the end of statistics. when those who have influenced trying to spread Fud intentionally. We do not want to suggest that all project groups mentioned in the tweet are deliberately manipulating data. we do not confirm that Cardanos data is not manipulated. we will prove that Solana does not have 1. The first mistake of the influential person in the tweet is to ignore Bitcoin. the oldest blockchain and tron. leading in daily user statistics. The following table from the CoinMetrics portal provides user data daily for almost all blockchains. In the chart. you can see the data rounded in the past time. The second mistake of the influential person is that he presents the number of daily users as the number of daily operating addresses. In the back of the article. I will explain why this is meaningless. See the number of daily operating addresses on Solana byeblock.',\n",
       " ' DAA refers to the only public addresses that are active on the blockchain every day. It includes the senders address and the recipient. For Solana. DAA reported that 1. 6 million will imply that at least one transaction has been sent from 800 only senders to 800 only recipient addresses. The ratio between the senders address and the recipient may vary. Solana supports many people in a transaction. It may include many target addresses when creating transactions. allowing users to send property to many people at the same time. Many transactions can be sent between the senders address and the only recipient. This fact is not important in the context of DAA. The problem is that a user can own many addresses. if Alice and Bob want to send 10 transactions to each other. they can reuse a single address for each transaction or create a new address at a time. for 10 transactions between 2 users. they can only use 2 addresses or up to 20 addresses. you can see that Alice and Bob each create only one address for 10 transactions. Only 2 addresses are included in DAA statistics. you can see Alice and Bob create a new address each time for 10 transactions. 20 addresses will be included in DAA statistics. To interpret the 1. 6 million DAA is 1. 6 million only users. we have to assume that each only address corresponds to a single user. This means that all users use the address and no one creates a new address. this is an unrealistic assumption in reality. In some ecosystems. like Ethereum. the address is often reused. in other ecosystems. creating new addresses for each transaction is prioritized to improve the privacy and security of users. it is advisable to create a new address for new transactions. See the number of non -voting transactions on Solana byeblock. Solana handled up to 40 million non -voting transactions. According to Dune. about 40% of successful transactions and 60% of successful transactions. 90% of Solana transactions are carried out by BOT. 10% are not BOT transactions. BOT transactions. like transactions from real users. require new addresses. BOT is usually designed to create large numbers of transactions quickly. we can assume that BOT creates more addresses than real users. With this information. try to estimate how many users actually use solana daily. We need to determine how many addresses are created by BOT compared to real users. we must consider how failed transactions affect DAA statistics. Solana processed 70 million transactions every day. nearly double the number reported by theBlock. As you can see. this is a complex task. 6 million daily operating addresses on Solana are not only created by real users but also by BOT. Because an entity can create multiple addresses every day by sending multiple transactions. the number of solana users can actually be significantly lower than what the influence has declared. Try estimating the actual number of solana users. Consider 24 million successful transactions without voting every day and 1.',\n",
       " ' 6 million addresses in operation. Each transaction requires 2 addresses. For simple transactions with a sender address and a recipient address. we have 800.000 addresses where the sender is operating and the same number of recipients. This means about 30 transactions sent from each senders address. If we assume that the BOT creates new transactions (and addresses) at the same speed as real users and real users account for only 10% of the total number. the actual number of users will be 10 times less than DAA. which means that only about 160.000 (80 thousand people and 80.000 recipients). The daily actual user will send 2. 4 million transactions (10%). each sender will send 30 transactions per day. Users can reuse the address. If all real users (senders and recipients) reuse the address. 160 thousand will be the maximum of them. if each user creates a new address for each transaction. there will be only 5. 3 thousand real users. The reason for this simplification leads us to the fact that only 5. 3 thousand to 160 thousand real users. Consider another scenario. Suppose the BOT produces 20 times more addresses than real users. It is a practical assumption. This means that BOT produces 1. 52 million addresses. while real users only produce 76.200. This is the maximum number of users (both senders and recipients) in this case if people create a single address every day and reuse that address. Similar logic application for transactions. BOT will send 22. 8 million transactions. while real users only send 1. 14 million. each sender will send 30 transactions per day (38.100 senders and 38.100 recipients). If each user creates a new address for each transaction. there will be only 2.540 users. Based on this reason. the actual number of users can range from 2.540 to 76. Consider an optimistic script. Suppose that real users also act as BOT. Both groups will create 800 thousand addresses and send 12 million transactions per group. We have 400.000 real senders and 400.000 real people. each user will send 30 transactions per day. If all users re -use the address. the maximum number of users who can (senders and recipients) will be 800k. if the user creates a new address for each transaction. the minimum number of users will be 26. In this optimistic scenario. the number of real users is 26. 6 thousand to 800 thousand. users and BOT will sometimes create a new address and sometimes reuse the old address. depending on the specific case. 30 transactions on each sender are quite high. even for positive transactions. showing that most transactions are created by BOT. it is possible that most of the addresses in DAA statistics are from BOT. Our estimates show that there may be 5.000 to 160.000 real solana users. but this is a wide range and inaccurate. it is difficult to get a more accurate number. It is important to consider other statistics. such as user activities on social networks. The Solana community does not work much on the X platform.',\n",
       " ' Solana is hard to compare with older projects like Ethereum or Bitcoin in terms of network effects without a significant presence on social networks. The same thing is applied to projects like Tonchain. Sui and Aptos. The numbers in the tweet of the person who have an impact are not correlated with the users activities on social networks. this is at least suspicious. When the network fee is low. it is easy to manipulate statistics. A large number of transactions can be made at a minimum cost. with a transaction fee of 0. 001 USD. you can send 1.000 transactions with only 1 USD. The creation of 1 million only address for statistical purposes will only cost $ 500 a day. making this an inexpensive marketing strategy. When it comes to human resources. BOT is a very cheap choice. What is the cost of using BOT to manipulate statistics as on Solana? A regular cardano transaction costs about 0. 05 USD (ADA = 0. 33 USD). This means you can send 20 transactions for $ 1. To send 1.000 transactions. it will cost $ 50. creating 1 million only address will cost $ 25.000 per day. This is the answer to the question why BOT is not used regularly on Cardano network as on Solana.August 12. Over the years. Cardano has continuously won many polls on the X platform. Most recently last week. Cardano won Bitcoin in the semi -final and Ethereum in the final of the poll made by Bitpanda. With 90.000 followers. Bitpanda is considered an independent entity. not linked to any specific project. This periodic success ensures a stricter test. we will discover the different aspects of this phenomenon. The poll of Bitpanda is one of many examples in which Cardano is recognized as the most popular project. In the poll. Bitpanda started with 16 projects. including Bitcoin. Dogecoin. Ripple and other projects. If you predict the results. you may consider factors such as market capitalization or network effects. Most think that Bitcoin will take the top position. then Ethereum in second place. For third place. candidates may include Ripple. Solana or even Cardano. On X. this seemingly reasonable speculation does not work. If you look at the battle between Ethereum and Solana. you will find that 78. 2% of the 784 voting votes have voted for Ethereum. It is important to highlight the percentage of voters significantly lower than the cardano poll compared to Bitcoin. with 3.725 participants. In that poll. Cardano won a noticeable victory over Bitcoin. winning 87. 2% of votes. In the last battle between Cardano and Ethereum. the record was 8.794 voters. Cardano won. won 84. 4% of votes. In similar polls. participants can vote strategically to combat projects they do not like. a Bitcoin enthusiast can vote for Cardano simply because they prefer it more than Ethereum or vice versa. It should be noted that the results of polling are not necessarily suitable for market capitalization or network effects. When Cardano is included in the polls.',\n",
       " ' the level of interaction from the same Twitter account may be up to 10 times higher than when Cardano is absent. Surely everyone wants to learn about the cause behind this phenomenon. The most reasonable explanation is that Cardano has a particularly large and cohesive community. Although the Bitcoin and Ethereum community is also very significant. they may not participate actively. Occasionally there are statements that some voters may be robots. we saw that the polls had suspicious changes. often significantly changing right before the vote ended. if you check the comments on these polls. you will notice that Cardano fans are very positive. not only in voting but also in commenting. They often use the phrase good polls. initiated by Cardano Whales account. In comments. Cardano fans often realize familiar faces in their community. showing that these participants are genuine. not BOT. The Twitter platform can amplify the approach of these polls. which can explain why Cardano constantly winning. Although Twitter algorithm can help Cardano. this does not explain why other communities do not apply similar strategies. Anyone can post the poll and ask the community to vote or comment on the poll. Another possible explanation may be the rise of Cardano Fud. A significant part of the community has decided to actively oppose Fud. which can lead to increasing interaction with X. Some media. including major media such as Forbes. often describe Cardano from a negative perspective. just last week. Forbes published an article claiming that Cardano was an Ethereum copy. resulting in a community note that was added to the post. Interestingly. this negative article about Cardano has attracted significantly more interactions than many other Forbes articles. The article has 92 re -posted and 192 likes. the interaction level is 10 times higher than that of other Forbes articles on other topics. including the Paris Olympics. Some comments from the community have received dozens of re -posted and more likes than the original post. This can only be understood as the fact that when the cardano community reacts with a post. it can increase the level of interaction of stores like Forbes. This article forbes is an example. The Cardano community faces similar challenges every week. Whenever any Crypto media posted false information. the community would react strongly. as seen in the case of Forbess article. The war that is going against this Fud may be what the community is always cohesive. Consider an example from the context of Crypto. Bitcoinnewcom. an account with nearly 160 thousand followers. mainly shared news about the Bitcoin ecosystem. Charles Hoskinson mentioned in a post. This post has become the most successful post in recent days. receiving the highest number of times and likes. It has attracted about 200 comments. including malicious comments from Bitcoin worshipers and feedbacks from the Cardano community. Another phenomenon is that many negative writers about Cardano to participate in interactive farming activities. Although there was a year before the price increases. the interest in Crypto on the Twitter platform was still low.',\n",
       " ' Posts from large Crypto media such as Cindesk. U. Decrypt.  Bankless . Cointelegraph and other media received a minimum level of interaction. usually only dozens of re -posted and dozens to hundreds of likes. the very positive news can push this number 10 times. Bitcoin Magazine. 2 million followers. notably the most successful Crypto. with posts that often receive thousands of re -post and likes. These impressive figures are very rare in the field of crypto. If Bitcoin magazine shared a link to the polls asking people to vote for Bitcoin. Cardano may not have won. or at least not such decisive. Bitcoin magazine does not use Twitter account to share the article. They act like people who have more influential and regularly post their thoughts. The participation of the Bitcoin community can be shown in accounts like Bitcoin magazine. About 5k-10k people are willing to republish the post or praise the post with likes. the most influential Twitter account belongs to Michael Saylor. Interactions are similar to Bitcoin magazine. Types of articles are similar. During Bitpandas polls. about 7.450 people voted for Cardano. this number is still more than the likes that Bitcoin magazine posts often receive. Based on these numbers. it seems that the level of the Bitcoin community on the Twitter platform is equivalent to the Cardano community. the participation of the community may be different. This is a preliminary estimate and need to analyze more in detail to get accurate data. this article is not intended to provide such an analysis. The peak of social media around Crypto is in the price increase in 2017 when Bitcoin reached the highest level of all time. At that time. everyone seemed to be interested in Crypto and ICO. Social media is filled with discussions and people are talking about crypto at social events and even on public transport. In 2021. a slightly lower operation. according to Google Trend data. Despite this fact. Bitcoin has created a new ATH. I predict that by 2025. the level of public participation is even less than 2021. Many people are familiar with Crypto and no longer feel the need to search for new information anymore but turn the focus to other topics. What the Crypto industry should be concerned about is the increasing interest from beginners. During the price market. both the desire to hold crypto and the use of blockchain technology are significantly reduced. this is the main issue that needs to be solved. Despite the general interest in Crypto. Cardano maintains a cohesive community. According to Google Trends. the interest in this project is similar to 2017 when Cardano entered the field of crypto as a new one. Why is the communitys size reflected in other places?. Why is the scale of the cardano community not clearer in other areas? Why is Cardano not more present in DEFI or have higher market capitalization? How did only be 170 people voting for Solana in a competition against Ethereum. yet Solana is still considered to have more users? The reason is that if there are many people using Solana 10 or even 100 times.',\n",
       " ' according to TPS. why dont they vote in a poll that they can easily win?. The activity of Bitcoin is about 4. 5 TPS. while its largest second layer. Lightning Network. displays about 2. Although there are many people who hold the most money. the Bitcoin network is not widely used. with most people holding BTC as a valuable storage vehicle. The use of Cardano is similar to Bitcoin or Lightning Network. with TPS from 2 to 10. depending on the number of UTXO outputs in the transaction. Many people in the Cardano community sees ADA as a valuable storage vehicle and see DEFI as a good choice that they have not used much. Cardano has 1. 3 million stake people. but only about 1% of the X platform. Only about 0. 2% of Stake people hold any Stablecoin available in the Cardano ecosystem. Ethereum has a huge number of users. especially in the second grade. with an activity up to hundreds of TPS. Despite the large number of users. Ethereum did not win the poll on the X platform. asking questions about the level of interaction of the user. Cheap transaction fees can lead to manipulated statistics. as seen on Solana and maybe on some Ethereum layer 2. The higher operation can also be motivated by AirDrop. in which projects encourage trading with financial rewards. false statistics. Meme trading can create many BOT transactions. making it difficult for analysts to distinguish real users from BOT. although Bitcoin and Cardano show the true interest of users for the use of Blockchain. low transaction fees can falsify statistics. Cardano is not designed to become a Hodl; It means a global financial and social operating system. which needs active users to fulfill their mission. The cardano community should consider how to attract more participants in the use of DEFI. how to attract new people. I have encountered the view that Cardano users are not interested in AirDrop. Meme or NFT. they focus on cases used in the real world. Cardano may need an assassin application ’ - something that stands out compared to conventional DEFI services on other chains. Axo Dex. which provides unique trading options on the blockchain. can be a game change service. Perhaps what we really need is better marketing for these creative applications on Cardano. Cardano may win the next poll. but this does not guarantee the success of the project. Although it is a testament to the participation of the community. Cardano needs more than the victories in the poll; It needs to develop network effects. requiring higher expansion. The loyal Cardano community is ready to wait for advances such as Ouroboros Leios. Zero-Knowledge Rollup and Partnerchain. This patience reflects the belief that Cardanos superiority will eventually be recognized. this expectation may be risky. Many more expanded chains are attracting new users and venture capitalists to support DEFI projects. The loyalty of the cardano community may not last forever. To succeed. Cardano must start fulfilling his mission.',\n",
       " ' Other ecosystems have accelerated with significant investment in development and marketing. Although sometimes there are contradictory results. Cardano needs more than just winning the polls to thrive.August 7. Cardano ecosystem is expanding Stablecoin range. giving users a variety of options. Among these are Stablecoin DJED that is mortgaged exceeding the algorithm and two synthetic stablecoins: IUSD from Indigo and Myusd from Mynth. there is Stablecoin USDM supported in USD from Moneta (formerly Mehen). Another Stablecoin is supported in USD. USDA. developed by Encryptus and Emurgo. expected to launch this year. Although USDT and USDC are not originally cast on Cardano. they can still be used through Wanchain Bridge. where the first anniversary of forming Cardano. This article learns more about the stablecoin available in the Cardano ecosystem. The DEFI ecosystem is still in the early stage. which has begun to develop in the price market after 2021. It has not experienced a price increasing market. often bringing an increase in the number of new users. The first Stablecoin was introduced as IUSD synthesized from Indigo. launched in November 2022. The latest addition was Myusd from Mynth. launched in December 2023. Stablecoins history on Cardano lasted less than two years. Below is a table of overview of all stablecoins. including creation date. current supply. number of owners (according to accounts). total transactions and number of transactions in selected epochs (425. 450. 475 and 500). The period of 25 epoch is about four months. In terms of the number of people holding. the total number of transactions and supply. DJED is the most successful Stablecoin in Cardano ecosystem. followed by IUSD. This may be because these stablecoins have existed for the longest. The only Stablecoin was supported in USD so far. USDM. has been impressive since its launch in March 2024. USDC and USDT. connected via the Wanchain Bridge. has also received the trust of users. This bridge is currently a decentralized choice and tested over time to transfer Stablecoin and other assets to Cardano ecosystem. USDC and USDT are used by users almost equally. although USDC has a little more than USDT. If you combine the statistics of both stablecoin bridges. they will be able to compare with MyUSD. In terms of total transactions. they can even surpass USDM. but the launch date should be considered. The total supply of Stablecoin in Cardano ecosystem is worth $ 31. These stablecoins are held by 2.283 users who have made a total of 1.462.993 transactions. The number of stablecoin transactions continues to increase. during the entire existence of Stablecoin on Cardano. there are about 2.000 stablecoin transactions processed daily. In Epoch 500. there are about 400 stablecoin transactions every day. Let us consider more carefully the individual projects. USDM The popularity of USDM is increasing. Since its launch. both the number of transactions and users have increased steadily. It is predicted that the original stablecoin supported in Cardano will be considered by users to be the safest. Current statistics support this expectation. Stablecoins are supported in USD with good achievements in maintaining their USD exchange rate.',\n",
       " ' Other types of stablecoin faces more challenges about this issue and may encounter slight discounts. especially during the chaotic market. Synthetic assets like IUSD and MyUSD are working very well. Despite the high competition in the Cardano ecosystem. the number of IUSD users continues to increase. The level of transaction is still relatively stable. may be slightly reduced due to the negative market and summer vacation. MyUSD is a new project that needs the trust of users. It was released about three months ago. Despite the lowest supply. Myusd recorded the highest number of transactions in Epoch 475 and 500. DJED maintains a stable user basis. although the number of transactions decreases slightly. possibly due to increased competition. DJED reserves contain more than 35 million ADA. allowing about 12 million DJED. with the reserve ratio of 410%. can cast both DJED and Shen tokens. There have been many discussions in the Cardano ecosystem for the reason Circle and Tether have not cast USDC and USDT on Cardano. these stablecoins have joined the ecosystem through the Wanchain Bridge. If USDC and USDT are originally cast on Cardano. they may become a favorite choice for users. The Wanchain Bridge has recently held the first celebration to launch Cardano and Stablecoin bridges of USDC and USDT. The longer the Wanchain bridge. the more people believe in the transferred property. USDC has a slightly advantage over USDT. nearly 1 million USDC. while USDT is only about half of them. Despite the difference in supply. the number of transactions is relatively uneven. both USDC and USDT recorded 170 transactions on each side. a total of 340 transactions. This figure exceeds the number of USD transactions and is only a bit less than IUSD. According to Visa. where data from Allium. about 900.000 users send stablecoin transactions daily. This means about 11 transactions per second (TPS). USDT is superior to USDC. while other Stablecoin occupies a smaller market share. Stablecoin is mainly used on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Tron. Of the about 25 million operating addresses each month. 11 million on Tron and 9 million on BSC. Polygon has 2. 3 million operating addresses. while Ethereum and Solana each address 1. 7 million. If you convert this data into a daily number of users. there are about 360.000 on tron. 300.000 on BSC.000 on polygon and 55.000 on both Ethereum and Solana. The entire Blockchain industry processes about 10 TPS when it comes to Stablecoin. Stablecoin transactions thrive at low transaction fees. such as on Tron. BSC. Polygon and Solana. Ethereum does not work in this respect. this can be understood. Users seek the most effective solutions. expect reliability. speed and low fees from stablecoin transactions. see them as alternative options for traditional payment networks. the expectations in the DEFI ecosystem may vary. In terms of Stablecoin supply. the Ethereum ecosystem leads with 46% market share. Tron followed with 36% and BSC in third place with 3%. It is worth noting that although BSCs Stablecoin supply is significantly lower than Ethereum and Tron.',\n",
       " ' it is clear that it still leads in the number of transactions. It should be noted that low network fees can sometimes lead to statistics that are misleading or manipulated. On Cardano. quite low compared to Tron with 300.000 daily transactions or Ethereum with 55. Ethereum is about 140 times better than Cardano. Both Tron and Ethereum are old projects. Tron is particularly successful in Asia and has become a payment system. Ethereum is outstanding as a DEFI platform. many Stablecoin transactions are processed on polygon. Layer 2 of Ethereum. rather than on the main Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum also has some other Layer 2 networks working well. Cardano has not experienced a price increasing. so it has not built a strong user basis. Hopefully this will change in the upcoming growth market. By the beginning of 2025. the first 2 layers using Zero-Knowledge password can be distributed in the Cardano ecosystem. which can increase the number of stablecoin transactions. the fierce competition and the Cardano ecosystem will certainly face many challenges. Another interesting comparison is with Bitcoin ecosystem. Lightning Network handled about 2. 5 TPS in routing transactions. This means that the number of stablecoin transactions is processed about four times more. This emphasizes Stablecoins significant importance to the blockchain industry in terms of the number of users and transactions. It can be assumed that the number of stablecoin transactions will increase faster than trading with easy -going crypto types such as BTC. ETH or ADA. The entire blockchain industry is still in the early stage. 757 million handling visas per day (about 9000 TPS) and is one of many players on the payment market. Trading with stablecoin on all blockchains combined has not even reached 1% of this volume. This means that technology will eventually achieve global popularity still has a lot of things that have not been decided.August 5. Metamask. Ethereum wallet is the most widely used in the crypto industry. is proud to have tens of millions of users. the NUFI group has announced the support of Cardano in the Metamask wallet. simplifying the access to the Cardano ecosystem for millions of new users. The NUFI group has integrated cardano supporting the Metamask wallet with Metamask Snap. Snaps are third -party features that users can install to enhance the function of Metamask. Cardano Wallet Snap. developed by NUFI. allows users to get cardano locks and sign direct transactions in Metamask. Cardano lock is made from the phrase of Metamask seeds. which means the security and restoration of Cardano assets depend on the security of the seed of the Metamask wallet. When signing a transaction. the enabled window is enabled. the users confirmation requirement in the wallet. After users add Cardano Snap wallet to Metamask. they will receive Cardano wallet with Blockchain Cardano address. This allows them to transfer ADA to their wallets and start interacting with Cardano Dapps. Using Cardano Snap wallet is very simple. Just visit your favorite cardano DAPPS and click the connection button to link your cardano wallet.',\n",
       " ' Metamask can be one of the choice for this connection. Cardano Wallet Snap will start with the Metamask 12. 0 version. expected to be officially released in mid -August. If you want to try it now. you will need to manually install Metamask version 12. 0 by switching to the developer mode in the extended utility management section. Cardano Wallet Snap works through NUFI utility. acting as a bridge between Cardano Dapps and Metamask. NUFI utility is an auxiliary for Cardano Wallet Snap. When the user starts Cardano trading. that transaction needs to be approved in Cardano Wallet Snap. interacting with NUFI utility. After being approved in utilities. transactions must be confirmed in the Metamask interface. After being confirmed in Metamask. the transaction will be sent to Cardano network with sub -utility. For the first time using Cardano Wallet Snap. you will need to add extensions into Metamask before continuing. If you have Metamask version 11. x. you will be upgraded to the 12. 0 version as described above. Just confirm the installation of Cardano Wallet Snap and for a moment. Cardano wallet will be available. It takes a few seconds. Cardano Wallet Snap allows you to buy ADA via credit cards or exchange assets for ADA. You can send ADA or other assets from other cardano wallets or exchange to Cardano Snap wallet. Money will be received within a few seconds. like in other cardano wallets. The connected wallet allows you to interact with Cardano Dapps. you can test it with VIFI. Cardano Wallet Snap allows you to open NUFI wallet. enhance your interaction with the Cardano ecosystem. You can find the ‘nuFi opening’ option at the top left of Cardano Snap wallet. With NUFI wallet. you can  stake  ada or send cardano assets to another cardano address. Cardano Wallet Snap can be considered as a NUFI wallet entrance that you will probably need more advanced activities. It is worth noting that this project is funded by Catalyst. It is encouraging to see projects that enhance the ability to integrate with other ecosystems. Metamask acts as a gateway to many ecosystems. beyond the Ethereum off-chain. Metamask basically does not understand the Cardano ecosystem and cannot interact with it like Cardano wallet. Cardano Wallet Snap acts as a bridge between Metamask and Cardano Dapps. It takes Cardano lock from the phrase of Metamask seeds. built cardano transactions and allows them to be signed in Metamask. Cardano Wallet Snap can become the gateway to the Cardano ecosystem for those who only install Metamask. Through Metamask. they have access to NUFI. IE. Come to an official cardano wallet.August 3. Input Output is very happy to be introduced to the first step in the partners journey. following Charless vision at Summit Cardano in November 2023 and this blog post. This first release shows a turning point in the roadmap to implement that vision. Some chains lack the number of authentication. making the network more likely to attack at low cost. The release of the partners Alpha V1 allows the developer developers to start its security by taking advantage of the wide network of SPOS (SPO) of Cardano.',\n",
       " ' By taking advantage of SPO. both new networks and current networks can quickly increase the number of authentication programs to have a stronger and more effective security model. This release includes a set of tools to introduce the following improvements for developers:. The focus of these improvements is a single committee selection algorithm that integrates Cardano data to create reliable forms of committees that can create a percentage of blocks that are predefined. thus enhancing the security of emerging protocols. The release of Alpha V1 is the beginning of the journey. It aims to receive feedback from the community. but this release should not be used in direct production networks. Input - Output wants to do this publicly. along with the community and welcome feedback. Midnight will be the first series of partners to launch. Midnight combines the partner chain technology that allows Cardano Spo to work as the launch of the network. Learn more about Midnight here. Stay tuned for some interesting new developments in the coming months. along with detailed roadmap. Ouroboros Leios. Sharding and classification architecture are three solutions that can be expanded separately with different impacts for Layer 1 cost. In Ouroboros Leios and Sharding solutions. the cost is used to cover the operating cost of blockchain. Layer 2 network operates with parasites on Layer 1. with network operators 2 profits while the original blockchain may be economic affected. Payment fee on layer 1 is very important for the privacy budget and will become increasingly important over time. expansion must be designed to take into account the long -term economic sustainability of Blockchain. It is a challenge. The most established extension solution is Lightning Network. Layer 2 of Bitcoin. it does not attract many users like many Layer 2 networks in the Ethereum ecosystem. such as Arbitrum. Base and Optimism. There are dozens of layers 2 in Ethereums ecosystem. The second layer is based on the channel similar to the Lightning Network being built in the Cardano ecosystem. It was Hydra. the Ethereum group targeted the official Sharding but later moved to the roadmap to get Layer 2 as the center. They upgraded the network to introduce Blob. special transactions allowed Layer 2 to interact with Layer 1 cheaper. thus reducing Layer 2 fees. this upgrade has a negative impact on Ethereum\\\\s monetary policy. increasing the number of ETH circulating and challenging the story of Ultra-Sound Money. Sharding is a technology that has been implemented but has not been tested over time. Ouroboros Leios is still being developed. These new expansion solutions have a significant advantage compared to Layer 2: The fee is still the income for the Blockchain itself. instead of switching to the outside network with its own infrastructure and monetary policy. Although Layer 2 effectively resolves the ability to expand for blockchain. they can be considered as competitors on privacy budget. because third parties mainly benefit from user fees. Users have to waste layer 1 when moving the property between layer 1 and layer 2.',\n",
       " ' Layer 2 is based on layer 1 to store ledger data. take advantage of its security and decentralized. the Layer 1 fee is still much lower than that all transactions take place directly on Layer 1. The goal of Layer 2 solution is to allow users to make many transactions quickly and reasonably. Layer 2 transaction fee usually ranges from 0. 001 to 0. These fees are expected to decrease further in the future. Base by Coinbase processes more than 3 million daily transactions at an average fee of 0. 01 USD. while Arbitrum processes about 2 million transactions a day at a similar fee. Although the fee may fluctuate. the daily revenue of these 2 layers ranges from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. During the peak load. their revenue reached approximately one million dollars a day. The existence of Layer 2 ecosystem generates a load for layer 1 when users move assets between networks. leading to transaction fees for layer 1. People may wonder whether the total fee is higher if the Layer 1 is blocked. so the Layer 1 fee is increased due to higher demand or whether the transfer of assets between networks can generate equivalent revenue or not. the goal is not to make Layer 1 blocked. making this debate exciting. Additional revenue for Layer 1 comes from transactions initiated by Layer 2 to record data into Blockchain because these transactions are also charged. In the case of Ethereum. the revenue may be low because the Blob transaction fee is negligible. Bitcoin has nothing similar. so the revenue from on-chain transactions is linked to Lighting Network will be higher. the presence of layer 2 creates layer 1 transactions. thereby bringing revenue and improving user experience. Layer 1 is permanently blocked will disappoint users. causing them to move away. Layer 1 costs money for transactions on layer 2 with transferred assets. if Alice and Bob each transfer the property from layer 1 to layer 2 once. then each person performs 10 transactions a day on Layer 2 in the next month. Layer 1 will only receive fees for 2 transactions. the Layer 2 network will make a fee for 600 transactions. If the Layer 1 fee is 1 USD and the Layer 2 fee is 0. the Layer 1 will earn 2 USD while the Layer 2 will earn 6 USD. If Alice and Bob transferred their property back to layer 1. Layer 1 will earn an additional $ 2. if the user still uses layer 2 for a long time. such as a year. without making any layer 1 transactions. then layer 1 may face economic challenges. In this scenario. Layer 1 will mainly act as a platform introduction to layer 2. while Layer 2 will be the main beneficiary of the economy. It is difficult to predict the future development of Layer 2. the behavior of everyone and the need to use their Layer 1 trading in the Layer 2 ecosystem has been fully developed.',\n",
       " ' Many people have emphasized that the Layer 2 solutions act as those who cling to Layer 1. costs waste. Ethereums data test supports this view. Ethereum fell into inflation. with the number of ETH more released than being burned. This trend has reversed after the Dennun upgrade. introducing Blob transactions. Layer 2 network has infrastructure. including nodes or servers. The cost for these resources must be paid. just like users pay to maintain layer 1. This creates an inevitable competition between the Layer 1 and Layer 2 network. When Layer 2 becomes decentralized. safer and more reliable. users will tend to return to layer 1 slower and more expensive. At some point. Layer 2 can bring significantly higher profits than Layer 1. Although Layer 2 depends on Layer 1 to survive. the question is whether there is any mechanism given to transfer part of Layer 2 to layer 1 or not. When Layer 2 becomes more decentralized and handled a large volume of transactions and smart contracts. their operating costs will increase. Both operators are fully node 1 and Layer 2 will seek profits. the competition between layers 2 will make the fee decrease. reduce revenue. Although this article is mainly discussed on fees. there is still another important aspect to consider. If the demand for Layer 1 is high from both Layer 2 network and Layer 1 user at the same time. Layer 1 will still be a bottle bottleneck. This means that the problems of expansion will still exist. If the network uses the fee market. the Layer 1 fee will increase and the clogged layer will negatively affect the performance and fee of all layers 2. We saw this script with Bitcoin. When Bitcoin became blocked by Ordinals and the fee soared to dozens of dollars. users do not want to open and close the Lightning Network (LN) channels. The on-chain fee usually exceeds the amount of money users want to switch to LN channels. making the use of Lightning Network not economically feasible at the time. If the Bitcoin fee is always high. the use of Lightning Network for many cases will not make sense without the next innovation. transferring 50 USD to Lightning Network will not be realistic if the on-chain fee is usually $ 30. When wasting Layer 1 increases. the cost of layer 2 will also increase is inevitable. Businesses develop Layer 2 solutions to take into account this and adjust the fee accordingly. The dependence on this 1 -waste Layer fee is no longer ideal. Another problem arises when multiple layers 2 are introduced. resulting in fragmentation. Users may be forced to operate on many different networks. dispersing their capital. Different users may prefer different layers 2. making interactions less safer and more expensive. the connection of assets between these networks may be subject to Layer 1. there will be a unified network or ecosystem where the revenue is equally allocated. Sharding and Ouroboros Leios solutions seem to have fewer problems in this respect because the fee is collected by a single protocol that manages the reward mechanism.',\n",
       " ' Even from the perspective of expansion. it seems to be a more appropriate solution. because Blockchain is no longer a bottle bottleneck in the ecosystem. this does not mean that newer solutions will no longer be congested. Sharding and Ouroboros Leios can be described as a solution of Layer 1 expansion. They have similar characteristics. The ability to expand Layer 1 benefits to keep the fee in a single network because it can handle all transactions. This helps eliminate the need to share fees with another network. All fully active nodes contribute to the ability to expand and be rewarded directly by the protocol. From the user perspective. this is simpler because they always use the same wallet and address. avoiding capital fragmentation. Because all users are on the same network. they can always interact directly. The disadvantage of the ability to expand Layer 1 is that transactions are processed by the dispersed network. which is more expensive than the regular layer. Layer 2 can achieve fast processing time and very high ventilation. this may be a challenge for the ability to expand Layer 1. A more focused network will always be more effective than decentralized network. New users use blockchain solutions may find the lowest possible fee. balance between costs. reliability and speed. even if it means a decentralized sacrifice. This sets a challenge for layer 1. the Layer 2 fee will always depend on the waste of Layer 1. To keep the Layer 2 cost low. the Layer 1 fee must also be maintained at a low level. it is important that the Layer 1 must be expanded effectively. although most transactions will take place on Layer 2. Layer 1 can produce similar revenue with low TPS and high fees or high TPS and low fees. if the average fee is 1 USD and the network processing 7 TPS. the network can earn about 25.000 USD per hour. Please ignore the fee market. If a 700 TPS processing network for $ 0. 001. that network will earn the same amount every hour. in terms of expansion and user comfort. only the second option is feasible. Users will often choose business solutions based on costs. In the context of Blockchain. this means they prioritize the ability to expand and consider decentralization and security. The ability to expand Layer 1 can ensure the long -term economic sustainability of the blockchain. Users often tend to pay lower fees for similar services. If the Blockchain network continues to charge tens of dollars. the user eventually abandoned them. The advantage of the extension of Layer 1 is that it provides a decentralized network than the Layer 2. The real value of Blockchain lies in its decentralization. The discussion around the fee may focus on the balance between the fees and decentralization. In my opinion. the transfer of property from decentralized blockchain to centralized services. often supervised. is not meaningful. Concentration tends to lead to abuse of power. Many layers 2 still do not fully comply with decentralized principles and continue to exploit the blockchain industry.',\n",
       " ' Ouroboros Leios and Sharding offers more decentralized solutions than Layer 2. The revenue from the fee acts as an important part of the security budget. Ensure that users still use blockchain and are willing to pay for decentralization is essential for long -term economic sustainability and to achieve this requires effective expansion. Bitcoin requires special attention due to POWs high operating costs. Maintaining security will be a challenge if the fee does not compensate for the block reward is falling half of every four years. Bitcoin trading demand is not high. This may be because the demand increases suddenly. the fee will become extremely high. making users discouraged. the demand for decreases and average fees decreases below 1 USD. Up to the present time. the fee is 0. 3 USD. For one block. the operator received an average of $ 800 from the fee. while the reward of the block was about $ 200. The future prediction of solutions for expansion and decentralization levels that users will request is a challenge. The estimate of the time and economic sustainable issues that Layer 1 may encounter is even harder. The effect will be very important to succeed. A blockchain provides decentralized and best security with the lowest cost will have a competitive advantage. it does not guarantee that users will prioritize decentralized. Ethereum users feel comfortable using Layer 2. with the top 5 layers of general handling about 200 TPS. Lightning Network has not yet achieved significant traction. with Bitcoin that handling the number of transactions is twice as much as the Lightning Network (2. 5 TPS for unpleasant transactions). Most Lightning Network users choose the depository solution. I am a strong supporter for the ability to expand Layer 1. Even if most crypto users mainly use layer 2. we still have to consider the importance of introduction through layer 1. Layer 1 needs to be both affordable and effective. The ability to expand Layer 1 is improved is important because all layers 2 are based on it.July 31. The consensus mechanism of the network. whether based on POW or POS. must prevent Sybil attacks. This ensures that a single entity cannot create fake identities to gain control. The operation of a full node only costs a few dollars per month and therefore cannot guarantee security or decentralization. The number of block manufacturers is very important because they play a much more important role than normal nodes. it is a high allocation of decisions and incentive models. Many people still believe that the full number of nodes decides decisive and confidentiality. This misconception may originate from the early days of Bitcoin when each full node is connected to the network that actually enhances decentralization and security. most complete nodes actively participated in exploiting BTC. creating new blocks and earning rewards. The two main developments have changed this motivation: the appearance of the exploited pools in 2010 and the increase of ASIC exploitation tools in 2013. Desktop computers and laptops running adequate nodes cannot compete with the outstanding calculation power of ASIC exploitation tools.',\n",
       " ' the production of blocks becomes concentrated in some nodes called the pool. in which miners contribute their hash ratio. The full nodes operated by ordinary users no longer play an important role in decentralization and network security. using only a very small part of their CPU power. On the left side of the image. you can see the early days of Bitcoin with 6 full nodes. each user running a full node has the right to control the network. The right part of the picture shows the current distribution of decisions in the Bitcoin network. only 2 full nodes (pool) create blocks. supported by the miner author authorized the hash ratio for them. Full nodes are no longer directly involved in the production of blocks; They passively accept new valid blocks or remove invalid blocks. The decision to control the network is the calculation power (CPU or ASIC). not a complete node with a CPU that is not used for exploitation. It should be noted that in the early days of Bitcoin. all users operating adequate nodes also control the network because they are also miners. Today this is not true. The control of the network has moved to the miner (and partly the runner of the pools). the mercenaries than the actual network users. the benefits of user and mining may not always be suitable. Many people have not realized this change and continue to appreciate the importance of the full node for the Blockchain network. Running a full node is relatively cheap compared to the cost related to the exploitation. An individual can easily allocate multiple IP addresses and run a lot of full nodes. adequate nodes lack the ability to protect against Sybil\\\\s attacks. which means they cannot contribute significantly to network decay - perhaps only at a minimum of management. What is really important for the decentralization and security of blockchain is the distribution of expensive resources and incentive models. In Proof-of-Work (POW) networks like Bitcoin. this means distributing the ratio of hash. In the case of a shares of shares (POS) like Cardano. it involves the distribution of ADA. POW exploitation tools and ada manufacturers do not need to run adequate nodes to get the right to make decisions in the network. A full node can verify the entire blockchain history. allowing each user to ensure the integrity of the network independently. Although this feature is very important for blockchain security. most people rely on third party. About 90% of their crypto storage users on centralized exchanges. Very few users manage and operate a complete node. I do not know any network with more than 0. 001% of the holder who holds token is running a full node at once. Fully nodes are operated by manufacturers and exchanges. which often play the most important role for their services because their services are used by the majority of users. If the Pool requires an upgrade upgrade. it is important to wait until the majority of fully node operators have installed a new workstation version before launching a new function.',\n",
       " ' The priority is to ensure that block manufacturers. centralized trading floors and operators operate important infrastructure nodes upgraded first. The full nodes are operated less important and can be upgraded at the later stage. From the consensus perspective of the network. the normal nodes are the least important and their role is not significant. They consumed passive blocks created by the nodes of the block manufacturer and lacked mechanisms to warn or repair bad behavior of block manufacturers. The full node is operated by the manufacturers who actively participate in the production of new blocks and must have a compatible workstation version. The important thing for them is that new blocks are accepted by other manufacturers. because they rely on the next blocks to be added after their block. Manufacturers and authorized people can continuously add new blocks without communicating with normal nodes or interested in their opinions. According to the hypotheses. even if all normal nodes suddenly disappear or stop accepting blocks for any reason. block manufacturers can continue to build blockchain. it is necessary to consider social dynamics between block manufacturers. authorized people. adequate nodes and users. The conflict between the block manufacturer and the normal node operator will attract the attention of the community. Divine manufacturers cannot ignore the fact that some of the full nodes are eliminating the blocks they consider to be valid. Such conflicts need to be resolved because the last network must serve its user. Divine manufacturers are based on the support of users and are encouraged to be economically encouraged by transaction fees. as mentioned. only a small part of users run the full node. This gives manufacturers a very strong position in the network they can abuse. if a pool censors transactions from a significant number of users or participate in the MEV attacks. it can still create valid blocks that the normal Node will accept. Although the full node operator can learn about these issues from other sources. such as mem- pool analysis. their full node will not support the problem solving. Although block manufacturers can benefit from MEV attacks. the normal and helpless nodes are not helpless in preventing this dangerous behavior. They only accept valid blocks after they are created. If the full node operator refuses to accept valid blocks due to MeV attacks. their Blockchain version will not be synchronized with the version of the block manufacturer. A full node mining must accept Mev attacks without objecting. put them in weaker positions in the network. The network is controlled by expensive resources holders - call them authorized. These authorities specify the ratio of hash or tokens POS for the pools. allowing them to perform the explanation responsibility by converting their authorization to another pool that works fair. the operation of a complete node is not necessary for this execution. This is why decentralization should be measured by the number of block manufacturers and authorities. along with the allocation of expensive resources between authorized people. Delegates are not equal.',\n",
       " ' because more money can buy multi -resources and therefore have more control. The normal number of ordinary nodes is unrelated; They only play a passive monitoring role in the production process. Consider a more extreme scenario in which most authorized people and some pool began to create incompatible blocks. Suppose these pools install a modified version of the workstation that is not compatible with the version running on most full nodes in the network. This new version of the workstation may include a feature that some people authorize and Pool want to be forced to deploy or can activate some forms of fraud. If a significant part of the networks resources participates in such an attack. the full node operators will be helpless in proactive against it. This situation will lead to a fork blockchain and the next chaos. According to Nakamotos consensus mechanism. used by both Cardano and Bitcoin. the longest chain rule will be applied. this rule will lead to different chains dominating on different nodes. leading to fragmentation and uncertainty. Fraudulent pools. supported by most expensive resources. will create a longer chain. The full nodes running the original (older) version will refuse new blocks from these fraudulent pools and only accept blocks from the minority pools in expensive resources. the blocks on each competition string will be created at a slower speed. but the final chain of fraud will be longer due to a slightly greater support from expensive resources holders. How will the operator of all node react? They will face the choice: Continue to use the old workstation version and accept the shorter chain with less resource involvement or the application of a new workstation version and follow the longer chain rules. Predicting the result of such an attack is a challenge because it depends on many different factors. such as the actions of centralized exchanges. the stance of the core development pool and the influence of outstanding characters in the community. ETF release organizations will also have a significant influence. The full number of Node in the network is not related to the beginning and the results of such an attack. Each full node operator must make its own decision. but this decision will be heavily affected by the actions of other main players. If the other pools in the new version of the workstation and the authorized people are still loyal to these pools. the support for the old version of the workstation will gradually disappear to the point of complete stop. This example clearly illustrates the importance of the nodes of the block manufacturer compared to normal nodes. The pressure of users and investors may have a greater weight than the pressure of all nodes. The distribution of expensive resources between authorized people and the number of block manufacturers is more important for security and decentralization compared to the full number of nodes. The more the number of manufacturers in the block. the harder it is. the harder it is to collide and attack.',\n",
       " ' This difficulty also lasts to the delegate. Although an agreement between pools holds a significant part of expensive resources may be enough to start an attack. it may not be enough to maintain it. Some authorized people can only notice the attack after it has begun. After evaluating the situation. they may authorize their shares or the hash ratio to other pools. thus weakening the attack. A large number of adequate nodes can indicate the status and strength of the network infrastructure. The full nodes are more independent than monitor the production of blocks and network events that contribute to this situation. In the ideal world of Satoshi. every user will run a full node and control the network. today we know this is not realistic. For most users. even self -management is a significant obstacle. not to mention running all of their nodes. From a decentralized and security perspective. the full number of nodes is negligible. The main reason is that running a complete node can not protect against Sybils attacks and full nodes operators have less benefits in the game compared to exploiting or holding tokens. The comparison between hash and ada is very interesting. It is expensive for most people holding the BTC to run ASIC and unrealistic. They hold BTC as a valuable asset but still do not have the control of Bitcoin network apart from their ability to sell money if they dont like something. those holding ADA have the right to direct the network. If a Pool censors or conduct MeV attacks. the owner ADA may authorize their stake to elsewhere. This means that network users have the control of the infrastructure they use. unlike those who hold the organizers to rely on the operators and pool mining.July 29. The application of blockchain technology can follow many different paths. Satoshi imagined Bitcoin as an alternative to traditional financial institutions. While some governments continue to protest Crypto. other governments choose the prescribed application. The recent participation of leading politicians in the Bitcoin Conference 2024 signals a significant change. The organizers may race to attract heavy competitors to participate in crypto events. Conferences will provide a platform for the dialogue between policy makers and the crypto community. which can shape the future of our society. This can bring many positive things to Cardano and other blockchains. Donald Trump. a US presidential candidate. spoke at the Bitcoin Conference 2024. promised to dismiss the head of the SEC and ask the government to buy Bitcoin as a status reserve. Robert F. Kennedy pledged that. if he was elected president. he would ensure that the US government holds 4 million Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. Political campaigns often make unrealistic promises and although some people can believe in them. they are often disappointed when reality occurs. Trump is trying to attract new votes with bold promises. Although he can say anything and can act unexpectedly. the US government may consider buying Bitcoin. The trend of politicians appearing at Crypto conferences may continue.',\n",
       " ' making Crypto an important topic in political discussions. Politicians will need to give ideas about crypto because some voters will care about their stance on this issue. If the majority of the voter is open to new technologies. politicians will have to have the corresponding reaction. The dialogue between the Crypto community and politicians is very important. Politicians can be affected and can see the opportunity to support blockchain technology. If a government promises to buy Bitcoin. Ethereum or any other type of crypto as a status reserve. which can lead to increased crypto price. making investors satisfied. Although some OG holders can throw tokens at the head of the government. that will not change the general trend. Although it seems not wise when notifying or promising to buy a large amount of assets. governments may follow. similar to what El Salvador has done. Crypto is basically a technology. but their application. success and orientation are all promoted by the community. This may not be suitable for Satoshis original vision of a replacement financial system. Satoshi has disappeared. The community currently identifies the application path and has chosen to participate with politicians. Although this direction can be controversial. it is clearly a significant part of the community to support it and after all it may not be a bad choice. Perhaps a few years ago I would consider it a failure to fulfill Satoshis vision and a big dream. Today I dont care. because the initial vision is probably too ambitious. but above all. I find that a large part of the community does not care about Satoshis original vision. this vision is still possible. only the path will lead to another place. Need to continue effort and always remind yourself of the original vision. Finance is associated with banking and government services. The money cannot be completely separated from the state because it facilitates the interaction between the government and the people. Even if individuals moved to crypto. they are still citizens depending on the service due to the state of the operating state. the capital required to collect taxes. Even when a government. with the consent of the people. abolished the central bank and accepted Crypto. there will still be a close relationship between the state and the people. Monetary will always act as an interactive tool. Blockchain technology offers the potential to redefine freedom. explanation responsibility. voting system and ownership. only holding crypto in the state budget will not achieve these changes. I hope the power will return to the people through changes in the law to create favorable conditions for the application of blockchain and DEFI. If governments deploy CBDC. they will be able to use it on independent blockchains selected by users. Crypto must still be an alternative to those who want to avoid the participation of the state and support infrastructure for those who want to interact with the state through decentralized platforms. Crypto is hard to bring a violent revolution but a gradual evolution.',\n",
       " ' The participation of politicians at Crypto conferences shows that Crypto is moving from a resistance tool to cooperation efforts between organizations and community. A decentralization is very important in this process. ensuring that the community retains more control over the government. This balance will be a challenge. because history shows that long -standing blockchains tend to focus on block production or project management. I imagine a future with alternative payment systems. voting based on blockchain. strengthening political responsibilities and easier to dismiss. The token will strengthen the future financial infrastructure. led by encrypted Fiat currencies and CBDC. A decentralized identity will be as legal as the current ID card. paving the way for a more transparent and responsible society. Believing in rules. not people is ideal that society can achieve in the next few decades. The main direction has been identified and now the problem is to adjust the progression speed. the Government and the bank will not control infrastructure and money; They will be the user like others. The participation of politicians at the largest Crypto Conference signals their acceptance to the gradual evolution. This marks the beginning of a new era. a era far beyond the increase in assets. I always consider Cardano as an indispensable project in the future. With a focus on decentralization. administration on-chain and the budget system. Cardano has been well prepared to integrate with the government and the developing financial infrastructure. Cardanos application was applied by Dubai police. the efforts of many US governments to build a transparent blockchain -based voting system and success in Argentina and other countries. showing positive development. Many other examples exist. like Bitcoin. has a large community to support the application. I see the difference in their mission: Bitcoin enthusiasts often focus on asset value. while Cardano supporters emphasize the use of more spacious blockchain technology. Of course there is overlap. Bitcoin and other blockchains are not ready to be widely applied as the foundation for future financial systems. Issues such as expansion ability. network stability and long-term economic sustainability need to be resolved. along with decline in decline and lack of interest in administration on-chain. Blockchain technology has made significant steps in both development and application. but the most important steps are still ahead. The mass application will require significant technological advances. I cannot predict the future. but many blockchain projects will play a role in social transformation. This diversity and competition enhances the ability to recover and promote development. This effort is not about short -term market capitalization. In the long run. the problem is which blockchain will help us change the best society. We need to determine our goals. build necessary technologies and then cooperate with politicians about the implementation of these technologies. All large projects are part of this collective effort. Its time to overcome competition and seize opportunities. What we need is as much as we can be a blockchain to flexibly meet the new needs of the changing infrastructure. while maintaining a high level of decentralization.',\n",
       " ' Such blockchain will be very valuable to society. this will be reflected in market capitalization. A strong team behind and independent financial resources for the project may be a great advantage that Cardano has. Cardano\\\\s Administration on-chain. with Dreps. represents investors and decides to withdraw the fund. can inspire similar mechanisms in the government structure if successful. Using Crypto in government reserves does not solve their fluctuations. build stablecoin supported by crypto as a reserve property. We have many opportunities to change society through blockchain technology. Continue to build. The government and the bank are not the holder of crypto property but must use them to interact with the user. It is a big difference. It is important to hand over power to the people. we do not expect too much. After the vote in the US. everything may be different. Another presidential candidate may be elected. Promises before voting may be broken. The US government purchase may not become a reality in the upcoming voting period. The current enthusiasm of politicians can change at any time if they feel they may lose control. The application of blockchain technology will come with complex obstacles that need to be overcome. Politicians often do not understand Crypto and are not aware of the problems they encounter.July 16. USDA was originally considered one of the first stablecoins supported in the Cardano ecosystem. in 2023. the Anzens group informed the community about the problems of regulations and communication soon. Many people believe that the USDA project will never come true. Mehems USDM. meanwhile. was launched and became the first stablecoin supported in the Cardano ecosystem. the USDA project is returning to a new. strong partner. On July 8. Emurgo announced that the USDA Stablecoin Anzens will be launched by Encryptus. Emurgo will continue to support the launch as a technology provider. Encryptus. an organized level. was founded in 2020 in Dubai. the United Arab Emirates. The company creates favorable conditions for the purchase and sale of crypto assets seamlessly. providing services converting to local money. Encryptus focuses on compliance. European license. VASP state in Lithuania and is proud to have the largest payment network stretching over 80 countries. The leading off-Ramp services in their industry ensure compliance with the rules and create trust for users. helping them to have a good position to overcome legal barriers when launching USDA. Users will be able to buy and sell USDA through the Anzens website after completing KYC verification. It is also possible to trade USDA through partners. USDA will be able to convert 1: 1 for USD and users from more than 80 countries can buy USDA with many different types of local currency. As the original cardano asset. USDA transactions will not require KYC and will not be censored or limited. DEFI users as well as the USDA organization will be fully supported in USD in a ratio of 1: 1 and available in Cardano Defi ecosystem. as well as for large -volume corporations and traders.',\n",
       " ' With Encryptus as a partner. USDA has a strong potential to apply in border organizations and payment. it must compete with stablecoins with names such as USDT and USDC. DEFI users will benefit from the diversification and enhancement of security as a stablecoin supported by another USD. like USDM. takes advantage of the Cardano ecosystem. USDT and USDC can only be used in Cardano as a bridge token. Many users have lost money because of the Hack Nomad Bridge. Some users may be reluctant to use the bridge token and will prefer the original token because the risk of use is much lower. Nomad Bridges hacking incident occurred due to an Ethereum part of the smart contract written in Solidity. It is important to mention that Wanchain Bridge. used to connect Stablecoin USDC and USDT from other blockchain with Cardano. have high operating time and good performance. The launch date of USDA has not been determined and before the past challenges. should avoid promising specific days. it is predicted that the launch may take place this year because Encryptus is an experienced and competent partner. The official notice will provide more clearly. The return of the USDA project has been suggested by Sheldon Hunt. the current head of the Cardano ecosystem in Emurgo. who promised more stablecoin. more VC interactions. more nursery programs. larger partnerships and more management community more. is becoming more and more positive. Along with IOG. Cardano Foundation and Intersect MBO. another strong player who is emerging in the Cardano ecosystem. We expect future notifications from Emurgo.July 10. Ouroboros Leios aims to resolve the challenge to maximize the capacity in the Blockchain Cardano network. focusing on gaining almost maximum ventilation. By balancing calculated resources. bandwidth and consensus efficiency. Leios tries to significantly increase the overall ventilation of the system while maintaining security properties. Although trading every second (TPS) is not an ideal measure for Cardano. we will check the theoretical TPS that can be achieved with Leios. the cardano block has a size of 90.112 bytes and a regular transaction is about 300 bytes. although this may vary depending on the number of output UTXO. Each block can contain about 300 transactions and because Cardano creates a new block every 20 seconds. which leads to about 15 TPS. Large transactions have more people who will save more than single transactions. The maximum trading size is limited to 16.384 bytes. which can accommodate up to 250 people. If a block contains such large transactions. about six transactions will be suitable for one block. sending the value to a maximum of 1500 recipients per block. equivalent to 75 recipients per second. such transactions are exceptions. This example proves that TPS is not a suitable measure for Cardano because it does not consider transactions with many recipients. In a recent DDOS attack lasting about 16 hours. Cardano managed 40 TPS reliably. IOG has established a block size and casting speed carefully. the demand for transactions sometimes exceeded the ability of the network.',\n",
       " ' causing IOG to increase the maximum block size. They follow the strategy of increasing the network throughout when needed. Higher pine can also achieve optimization. The moving applications from Plutus V1 to Plutus V2 requires less block fields. increasing the pine. the basic ventilation cannot be achieved only by optimization. In Ouroboros Leios. the pine will depend on the size and casting speed of the input block (IB). acting as a data carrier. The authentication block (EB) and the ranking block (RB) will contain only blocks. which may be as small as the minced jaw. The certificate of authentication will be transmitted in the network. with a part of resources allocated for voting. The input block will occupy the largest capacity. with the casting speed from 0. 2 to 2 seconds. The size of the input block is expected to be similar or larger than other blocks. The speed of the certification block will range from 10-15 seconds and for the ranking block is from 15-30 seconds. Consider a scenario where 100 IB. 4 EB and 1 RB are created every 20 seconds. If each block has a size of 90 kb. about 10 MB of data will be created in 20 seconds. a total of 1. 8 GB per hour. Each authentication block will refer to about 25 blocks each of the ranking block will refer to 4 authentication blocks (plus authentication certificates). the casting speed and size of all blocks may be placed cautiously to suit the needs. The smaller blocks will diffuse faster in the network and when the size of the block increases. the pine will increase due to more transactions on each block. the larger block diffuser slower. an unwanted side effect. As the number of nodes increases. the total latency also increases. meaning that the data will take more time to reach the furthest node in the network. The table below displays the TPS can be achieved at different casting speeds and size input. We set the maximum block size of 500 kb in the table. It was a random number. about 1500 TPS can be achieved with a block size set into 500 kb and the casting speed is placed in 1 second. Similar TPS can be achieved with a block size of 90 kb and the casting speed is 0. 2 seconds. It is necessary to observe the network to set the ideal ratio between casting speed and block size. In theory. it is possible to strive to achieve higher TPS by changing the parameters. in reality. we encounter limitations in the form of bandwidth. CPU and hard drive capacity. Higher pine will set a high hardware requirement for SPO. This can lead to higher reward requirements. The achievement of 1500 TPS is very significant for Cardano because in terms of the number of recipients per second. it can handle about 5.000 requirements of users per second. The result of 1500 TPS assumes simple transactions. requires 300 bytes to transfer values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bfrom Alice to Bob.',\n",
       " ' Other networks. not blockchain. may be used for payment transactions. The numbers given in the article are still theoretical. IOG is studying the prototype of Leios. The actual test will reveal the limitations of Ouroboros Leios. Increasing traffic will be a challenge for SPO. especially related to hard drive storage. It will be necessary to introduce some techniques that can reduce these needs. The options are data sharding. cut data or compress data.July 9.

Thank you for becoming part of the Anzens USDA community.July 8. Cardano Foundation has officially become part of the Blockchain inter -media (IBC). As part of this cooperation. Cardano plans to integrate IBC with its original technologies. this integration will promote Aiken and Mithril. This move aims to improve Cardanos interaction in the broader Blockchain ecosystem. The IBC protocol is an open source solution that facilitates sharing and communicating data between different blockchains. It acts as a digital link connecting more than 110 blockchain networks. allowing sharing of safety information. asset exchange and seamless interaction. Consider IBC as a digital bridge that links different blockchain networks. promoting interaction and expansion ability. Every year. IBC handled 30 million token transactions worth $ 30 billion. Interchain fund plays an important role in funding for the development and maintenance of IBC protocols. a vibrant community consists of independent developers who voluntarily contribute to enhance the features and capabilities of the protocol. IBC protocols are inspired by TCP/IP specifications to form the backbone of the Internet. Like TCP/IP allows seamless communication between computers. IBC sets a common framework for effective communication blockchain. This frame allows different blockchains to interact safely and share data. The IBC shipping layer handle important aspects of Cross Chain communication. It involves transporting data packages. authentication and ordering. The main components in this class include:. IBC facilitates safe cross chain interactions.  no need to be allowed . allowing data to be transmitted continuously on many different blockchains. Cardano IBC nurseries project focuses on creating a bridge that allows the exchange of information between Cardano Blockchain and Blockchain -based Cosmos SDK. It adheres to the IBC protocol and aims to fully comply with the essential parts of the description needed for the development frame. The integration of Cardanos IBC will lead to the development of Sidechain. It brings significant benefits to businesses. Sidechain acts as an independent blockchain active in parallel with the mainnet. linked through a two -way pin mechanism. This strategy benefits businesses in many ways. It gives them the flexibility in customizing blockchain solutions. enhancing the expansion ability to manage the volume of transactions increases. creating opportunities for multi -platform innovation initiatives and effectively rationalizing operating efficiency. Integrating with IBC also has a more significant benefit. This provides the option to connect the sidechain based on the Ethereum (EVM) virtual machine with Cardano. This will basically allow DAPPS deployment based on EVM on Sidechain Cardano. Among the other things. CF must build the Tendermint light client based on Aiken and deploy the original IBC.',\n",
       " ' Mithril will be used for signatures based on the threshold and evidence of the state needed for the original IBC connection. It is worth noting that the current deployment promotes a number of frames maintained by the Cardano developer community. They include Pallas. Lucid. Ogmios. Kupo and DB-Sync. The positive thing is that indigenous cardano technologies are used to develop connectivity solutions. The integration of Cardano with IBC shows an important component in the framework of comprehensive interaction. CFs initiative is part of the puzzle. Cardano has established a connection with multiple blockchains via the Wanchain Bridge. This integration allows users in the Cardano ecosystem to access assets such as USDT. Stablecoin USDC. BTC wrapped and many others. Another notable project to observe is Rosen Bridge. which now allows connecting ERGO. Cardano and Bitcoin. The group is actively working to connect supported chains with EVM -based chains. Cardanos IBC connection is expected to go into operation in the coming months. Lets believe that the integration process will succeed.July 5. Cardano Foundation (CF) has published sustainable indicators for Cardano network. These indicators are designed to conform to the upcoming Mica rules of the European Union. CF has achieved this milestone six months before the prescribed deadline. ## Introducing Mica Mica (Crypto Property Market) is a comprehensive legal framework set by the European Union to adjust the Crypto asset market within its jurisdiction. It takes effect in June 2023 and aims to provide EU unified market rules for Crypto assets that are not adjusted by current financial services law. This provision includes the main aspects such as:. In essence. Mica is designed to adjust the current financial rules with the innovation properties of Crypto assets. providing a harmonious system to adjust and monitor blockchain. crypto companies and other digital assets in the EU. This legal framework is expected to enhance the integrity of the market. financial stability and consumer protection in the Crypto asset market. Frederik Gregaard. CEO of Cardano Foundation. emphasized the importance of developing sustainable indicators to comply with Mica regulations as a major factor in establishing confidence between management agencies. investors and user community. Frederik Gregaard Noi:. With the effective mica regulations this week. the industry is currently counting six months to fulfill important ESG binding requirements. When the mature crypto market and mica regulations are fully valid. such efforts will be very important in building trust with management agencies. investors as well as users. paving the way for more widely application of blockchain technology sustainably. in collaboration with the Carbon Crypto Ranking Institute (CCRI). published a Mica compliance report on July 2. The report revealed that Cardanos energy -saving agent protocol significantly reduces electricity consumption. especially when compared to traditional evidence protocols. The report includes detailed data on Cardanos annual electricity. its carbon emissions and increased energy demand per second. These figures are in accordance with the preliminary technical standards proposed by the European Market and Securities Agency. showing Cardanos early compliance and the leader in preparation as prescribed.',\n",
       " ' Through these initiatives. Cardano is not only consistent with the upcoming EUs debut rules. but also sets a standard for the general Crypto industry. Gregaard emphasized the importance of these measures in promoting the more widespread acceptance of Blockchain technology. emphasizing the sustainability as the foundation of this process. Cardano Foundation has proved his proficiency through active actions. Cardano benefits from having a reliable partner that can solve important issues. thereby avoiding potential difficulties. When Cardano moves to management online . it is impossible to predict that Dreps or members of the Constitution Committee will undertake such tasks for the project.June 30. Cardano integrates Blockchain (IBC) to enhance connectivity and participate in the inter -chain ecosystem as businesses are increasingly exploring Blockchain technology. challenges related to expansion. data privacy and interactive ability can arise. Cardano Foundation has been building a construction block to introduce the ability to blockchain inter -communication (IBC) for blockchain Cardano. specially designed to allow trading and reliable data exchange on separate blockchain networks. The IBC frame not only works to improve existing systems but also expand what they can achieve. It facilitates the transfer of data and assets between various blockchains while ensuring businesses benefit from security and capital identification fees in Cardano blockchain. IBC is a widely used communication protocol to facilitate the exchange of information between different blockchains. By putting IBCs capabilities into Cardano. projects seeking to set a bridge between Cardano network and extra chain -based Cosmos SDK can use this solution. by deploying the IBC protocol for Cardano. the projects in our ecosystem can be easily connected to the Cosmos SDK chain and a wider chain ecosystem. including more than 115 blockchains connected to each other. Lien chain. a development and expansion of Cosmos. is an ecosystem of decentralized systems. can interact and have sovereignty. Designed to be modular and expandable. this architecture - access to the vast developed house ecosystem and functions provided by the inter -chain ecosystem - will develop along with blockchain advances. ensuring expansion and future resistance. In addition to participating in the inter -string ecosystem. the deployment of IBC for Cardano also adds another option to connect the Sidechain -based Sidechaine -Virtual Machine (EVM) based on Cardano. This will allow developers to seamlessly deploy decentralized applications (DApps) based on EVM on Sidechain Cardano. combining familiarity and tools for developers of the Ethereum ecosystem with Cardanos security and expansion ability. Cases of using businesses sometimes require an imbalance approach to the priority of the competitive blockchain trio: decentralized. expandable and security. Such cases raise significant challenges for developers of certain business applications. hinder their ability to innovate and expand their efficiency. The current fragmentation context. with diverse blockchain solutions that lack interactivity and architectural expansion necessary. can limit potential growth and technological progress at the level of enterprises. The development of Cardanos IBC Sidechain helps fight that limit. With the deployment of IBC on Cardano. businesses benefit from a framework to develop and implement Blockchain solutions that can be expanded.',\n",
       " ' safe and interactive. By combining small. agile and flexible application blockchain with reliable and decentralized infrastructure of Cardano. businesses can unlock the strength of corporate solutions. This integrated approach amplifies Cardanos capabilities. ensuring the network is still the foundation of the ecosystem. Cosmos and IBC are two pieces of a larger puzzle. with diverse interactive solutions that contribute to the vibrant and connected blockchain context. Regardless of the selected solution. Sidechain creates important advantages for business implementation. Flexibility: By allowing connections between diverse blockchain systems. Sidechain allows businesses to customize their blockchain solutions to meet specific business needs. thus enhancing flexibility in operation. private data can exist on Sidechain with selected information to share with the public network when necessary. Extension: Sidechain supports increasing number of transactions and interactions on many platforms without affecting performance. allowing businesses to handle higher trading volume and processing complex workloads. Multi -platform innovation: Sidechain allows businesses to take advantage of the strengths of many different blockchains. allowing them to renovate and develop solutions operating on many different blockchain. Optimized operational efficiency: By connecting to Cardano network. businesses can rationalize their operations thanks to the reliability and transaction costs that can be predicted by Cardano. Sidechain with fewer authentication can allow faster trading speed and reduce the cost of operating smart contracts. data storage and business logic. Operating security: Cardanos solid platform. such as Ouroboros. provides high levels of security and reliability for businesses using Cardano and Sidechains. through IBC combining strict protocols that help protect transactions from emerging holes. Cardano Foundation understands the power of connection and great potential of technologies to remove barriers. We hope that by adding IBC to Cardano. we will contribute to expanding the ability to expand. the scope of approach and connection of Blockchain technology. providing easier and better ways to deploy blockchain in the future that can interact.June 28. The Cardano network proved incredible recovery in a DDOS attack. maintaining operation without restarting the system. The impact is minimal. only observing the speed decreases slightly. the Sundaeswap decentralized trading floor successfully handled 5.013 orders in the attack. The developers at Anastasiarabs have discovered the attack and confiscated ADA from the attacker. When they realized their money was drawn to respond to their actions. as revealed in a tweet line. the attacker stopped the DDOS attack. A DDOS attack may be considered unsuccessful. The attack proved Cardanos recovery and certainly an interesting pressure test for the network. On June 24. at 2:58 pm. Cardano faced a DDOS attack ended on June 25 at 6:44 am. The attacker conducted an attack with three separate wallets. flooding the network with transactions containing the instructions. The number of transactions initiated from each wallet is as follows:. The cardano community will be very grateful if Kraken can provide information about the following wallets:. Address: 1QXV5HRUKG48VSE5LVE0458AHSH4J6XJRPKNHWR8ELM0AARQFWS07LVVNQ45xVJSYWJSYWSKFSKQLM4HPK8JK0TWGQJZCSAVHzy6. The core strategy of the DDOS attack is to flood the network with spam transactions containing instructions. aiming to depleted the resources of the network. This can prevent users from accessing the network.',\n",
       " ' Because Cardano acts as a distributed network. each full node is required to verify transactions. This is also applied to spam transactions. which are valid transactions payable. Even if the authentication process cancel 194 sets of trash (~ 16KB each instruction) for each transaction. the authentication process still handle spam transactions well. The attacker tried to exploit the gap when executing the instructions. The size of the reference commands currently does not affect the transaction fee. The set of instructions must be processed. including the performance of a number of jobs. the execution of command sets require Cek and reference input costs. increasing the size of the transaction and thus increasing fees. The DDOS attack leads to higher loading online. exceeding normal levels. The Spos (SPO) has been negatively affected by the higher number of Height Battle. Despite these issues. Blockchain Cardano continues to operate effectively. only a few small delays during the transaction processing time and some chain density reduction. The attack is an interesting pressure test for Cardano and is evidence of recovery. More than 1. 8 million transactions were handled by Cardano during the DDOS attack. Cardano has reached 40 TPS. Eutxo discovery also responded quickly to the attack. It can imagine the attack. The attack was stopped after the developers from Anastasialabs pointed out how to get ADA from the attacker. When registering for a Staking instruction set. the protocol requires 2 ADA. The cancellation of the command set registration requires authentication to be able to get deposit back. No authentication was deployed in 194 instructions used by the attacker. which means that there is no limitation that is determined for those who can get deposit back. Each time Always-Success authentication. This allows for cancellation of registration for everyone. because of the authenticity of Always-Success and the transaction fee is lower than the deposit. The attacker may think more about the attack and then repeat it in different conditions. The group has directly investigated the basic issue and identified the root cause. The group has successfully implemented the hot fix available in the new Node version 8. I ask all SPO to upgrade to the new version. Some media have reported a recent incident related to Cardano. Cindesk has not accurate that ADA users shares were violated. This information is not accurate. ADA is still kept confidential in the users wallet and spending can only occur when the transaction is authorized by the corresponding personal key.June 21. Cardano is standing in front of the doorstep to the Voltaire era. An important milestone in this journey will be HardFork Chang. paving the way for individuals to register as Drep. The registration process. along with the authorization of voting and proposals for administrative actions. is currently available for testing on Sanchonet. In the article. we will describe the Drep registration. You will find all the necessary links in the article. For testing networks. you need Cardano wallet to support Sanchonet and ADA testing network (TADA). Lace and Yoroi wallets are currently being supported.',\n",
       " ' I will use Eternl wallet. The first step. move your wallet to Sanchonet. In Eternl Wallet. you can move in the lower right part of the wallet. You may notice that there are 0 tada in the wallet. Sanchonet uses Faucet only governance. Copy the cardano address from the wallet to Faucet and receive TADA. Immediately after pressing the Submit button. you will receive 100k TADA. You are only allowed to receive TADA once for 24 hours. Once you have TADA in your wallet. you can go to the Govtool discussion session. connect your cardano wallet. The process is similar to when connected to DEX. After connecting the wallet. you will see all the options that the discussion session allows you to perform. Click the Register button in the Become A Drep window (become Drep). You will see the explanation of the following activity. you will know that you need to have 500 TADA to register. This is a refunded stake that you can get back if you pause as Drep. Click the Continue button. You will see a form that you have to fill out your information. Just DREP name. Other input information is optional. It is an email address. biography and social media link. Fill in information and click Continue. In the next window. confirm that you understand the need to store information accurately and click on Register. you are invited to download the file in the JSON format. this file will have the extension of JSONID. Download the file to your local drive. Note that in step 3. you are reminded of the file URL. Remember that. We will return to that problem. You need to upload the file to the public archive. Anyone. including Govtool. can view the content of the file. Github can be used as a public storage. create an account. You can use any other archive. But make sure the file will not be deleted after a while. Upload files to public archives. For github. click on the file. Download the file and confirm the change. You can see in the picture that I uploaded the GreatDrep. jsonid file. Click the file to view the content. This is the JSON format. At the end of the file. you will see the information you have entered the form. You need to paste the file address to Govtool. This is step 3 in the previous image with Govtool. If you use GitHub. you need to paste the file address to Govttool. not to edit GitHub with the open file. You need raw format. Click the RAW button and you will receive the URL for the file only. Only copy the URL after clicking on RAW. Paste the URL to Govtool (Step 3). After entering the URL. you can click send. After performing this operation. your wallet window will open and ask you to confirm the transaction. Transaction confirmation. You will see an orange notification that the transaction is being conducted. For a moment. you will see the green notice confirming that you have successfully registered as Drep.',\n",
       " ' You can return to the discussion. During the discussion. you will find yourself as a registered Drep and can copy your Drep ID. In the following image. you can see 3 certificates in Eternl wallet. Note that the DREP registration certificate contains URL to the file on github (anchor_url) and the hash function (anchor_hash). During the registration process. Govtool created a hash function from input data. In the end of the registration process. Govtool will create a hash function of the file you have uploaded to the public archive. Both hash functions must match each other. If not. your registration process will not succeed. The registration certificate is stored in the Cardano ledger. Hash has the effect of ensuring the integrity of data. If you make a single minor change for a file in a public archive. The hash of the file content will be different. This will reveal the change you have done. That means the data you enter during the registration process is different from the current version of the file. While the hash function in the certificate is stored in the ledger remain the same and may be accessed by you (or management tools) at any time. the hash function of the file content can be accessed many times. When different hash values. this indicates a change in the content of the file. I think some management tools can attract this inconsistency. If you want to change the content of the file. such as if you lose information in social networking platform or you start using another platform to communicate with the authorized person. proceed as follows. Pause as Drep and re -register from the same account. Provide new information when registering. Repeat the entire registration process. including downloading the file to the public archive. You will still keep the Drep ID. This means that the authorized person does not have to authorize the new ID. As Drep. you can browse administrative and voting actions (yes. no votes). You can propose new management actions. You can see all registered Drep. You can also authorize your tada money for any Drep. When we started a new chapter on our journey. we were very happy to announce the change of the Mehen brand name to Moneta. This transition is not only meaningful to change the name but also the evolution in the mission that brings financial autonomy to the Cardano ecosystem. Mehen is a pioneer for creating a USDM Stablecoin copper supported by legal money. an important asset in the Cardano ecosystem. USDM is designed to act as a fundamental property for decentralized financial protocols (DEFI). creating conditions for the payment immediately on-chain. Our vision is very clear: acting as an expanded catalyst for the development and widespread application of the entire Cardano network. Our journey with Mehen laid the foundation for USDM. acting as an expandable asset in the Cardano blockchaino. we are ready to receive a new identity that better reflects our vision and goals. Our conversion from Mehen to Moneta.',\n",
       " ' Leaving behind Mehens solid spiral. we receive freedom and conversion symbolized by a butterfly. Moneta symbolizes our commitment to financial autonomy and expanded growth. ” To allow metaphors to clearer butterflies. The focus of Monetas creative services is USDM. As Moneta. we continue to maintain the principles of stability and security with USDM. ensuring that USDM is still the foundation of financial rights in Cardano and more. ” This resumes the brand change to enhance the continuity during reading. Our transformation from Mehen to Moneta is not just a change of name; It shows our evolution and the spirit of our mission. We have chosen a butterfly as a symbol of our new brand. Moneta. affectionately called Monty by our group. The butterfly symbolizes freedom and a large range of options available in trade and policy making. This new icon is completely consistent with the goal of promoting our financial autonomy and growth. The Moneta logo is initially inspired by the pyramid shape. symbolizing strength. stability and growth - essential attributes in the field of finance. The timeless link of the pyramid with wealth and prosperity emphasizes our mission. Through creative rotation techniques and deductible design. the pyramid shape transformed into a minimalist wing. eventually turning into a butterfly. This transformation is not only aesthetic; It implies our commitment to freedom. progress and aspirations. By eliminating strategic shapes. we create a final logo that conveys depth and multi -dimensional. increasing visual appeal and reflecting our mission to empower individuals and businesses to have financial freedom and many opportunities. The design of USDM reflects its role as a reliable and stable asset in the digital economy. By combining the elements of the Moneta brand. the token design achieves streamlined and professional aesthetics. This design method ensures that USDM can still expand and adapt. ready to develop with improvements and functions in the future. The flexibility in design allows seamless integration with emerging technologies and market trends. ensuring the conformity and longevity of USDM in the dynamic context of digital finance. Despite the brand change. USDM stock code will still not change. ensuring continuity and the ability to identify in the market. We believe that it is time to have a new look. Through many discussions with the community. we realize the need for a more beautiful and more professional appearance. We hope you will like and receive this new brand as much as us. Our transformation from Mehen to Moneta marks a new chapter in our journey. a chapter that promises freedom. growth and greater opportunities. Welcome to Moneta. where we dedicated to empowering your financial future.June 18. Cardanos upcoming management framework will include three separate entities: the Constitution Committee (CC). authorized representatives (DREP) and the Stake Pool operator (SPO). After Hardver Chang is deployed. these entities will take control of Cardano. Spo can use Stake Pool to vote. Any ada holder can register as Drep and request authorization. There will be a temporary CC including 7 members. An individual can hold all 3 roles.',\n",
       " ' Lets think about the meaning of this for Cardano. In the fake anonymous environment. the strict implementation of the roles is impossible. The freedom to take on the role of Staking Pool (SPO). registered as an authorized representative (DREP) or election to a position in the Constitution Committee (CC) is open to everyone. No need to be allowed to limit these opportunities for individuals. In a decentralized ecosystem. there should not be any entity that has the right to force things like this. Administration. like block production. must be motivated by the motivation with the right to issue decisions allocated according to the proportion of the ownership of ADA token between stakeholders. There is no process of knowing your customer (KYC) in on-chain administration. along with the initial not using decentralized identity. making it impossible for an individual to prevent an individual from holding all three roles of administration. An individual can manage some cardano wallets anonymously. The stakeholders really need a voice in shaping the management structure they want. ADA holders are responsible for deciding whom they are assigning decisions for and whether they will support the candidate to pursue many governance positions. Journalists are often praised as democratic defenders. monitoring the role of different participants and their voting behavior on specific management proposals will be very important. The only party can hold all three roles. The question of whether a single entity is beneficial when holding all three management roles or not is still the topic to discuss. From the Constitutional point of view. CC members are tasked with assessing administrative actions. Yes votes show the conformity with the Constitution. leaving subsequent decisions for Dreps and Spo. CC members only evaluate the donation of management actions. Dreps and Spo of course can consider the Constitution when making a decision. in their case. the Constitution is not binding but rather caution. The Cardano Constitution will be based on principles. not strict rules. CC members must protect the decentralization. immutability of the ledger. vividness. long -term sustainability. openness. no need to be allowed and important aspects of all blockchain projects. Dreps and SPOs can pursue specific goals and can underestimate the importance of their decisions related to the needs of the protocol. CC members acting as a defender of the main features of Blockchain will be clearly defined in the Constitution. Can an individual play the role of CC member and is also Drep? Or even a spo? In that case. that individual will vote on specific management actions 3 times. each time with a different role. This can make a complicated awkward decision. a managerial move to express not trusting the committee is only voted by Dreps and Spo. CC members who have the role of Drep can vote yes. no or opposition. In such situations. the voting may be the most appropriate action. an individual may feel that the effort to dissolve the committee is unfair and as Drep (and SPO) voting no. If the shares of the drep are large.',\n",
       " ' their votes can prevent the dissolution of the committee. There may be a backlash from those who hold ADA that they dont like this behavior. They may authorize ADA for another Drep. The next vote on the same administrative action can lead to another result. Considering the proposal to allocate Ada capital significantly for marketing purposes. Assessing this requirement from the Constitutional point of view. from the long -term sustainability principle. may be difficult. Some CC members may have a different perspective on the boundary between the full budget and the ADA waste from the project budget. How should a person vote as a CC member and as Drep? Is it feasible to the same individual voting for each role?. A CC member can reject this proposal because it thinks it is unconstitutional due to  excessive withdrawal. voting no no . it is that individual. with the purpose of strengthening marketing efforts as Drep. which can vote   . a CC member can accept the money according to the constitution by voting yes. while as Drep. which can vote no due to different priorities. the consistent voting between roles is also a possibility. Perhaps it is a reasonable behavior. If an individual considers the request to be excessive for CC members. this should also be applied to the Drep role. Similar awkward situations may arise if an individual sits on many seats. The person holding ADA should consider carefully whether this is the allocation of desired power to them. they may ask CC candidates to make statements about how they will vote in such cases. It would be very beneficial if CC candidates declared publicly before whether they intended to give up the Drep position if elected or not. We do not say that all CC members have to give up the Drep position. There will certainly be people who do not want to hold more positions and vice versa. candidates will hold all three management positions. And maybe some individuals deserve to be trusted by the community. An additional aspect to consider is the potential motivation for active participation in governance. SPO has been compensated for the production of blocks and their shares to contribute to the management vote. It is predicted that there will be no additional reward for voting. It is expected that a selected Drep group will receive financial compensation. which can be distributed in proportion or equality. The exact amount of DREP is eligible for such rewards has not been determined. CC members temporarily do not receive financial rewards. the community can choose to provide compensation to future CC members. If this happens. it is important to consider whether individuals should be paid for each role they are in charge. especially if CC members also act as Drep. Do not forget that we are also talking about IOG. Emurgo and Intersect. who will be CC members. Should they be Drep? I think that even these entities should publicly declare their intention first. The division of power includes the division of government functions between separate and independent agencies.',\n",
       " ' This part usually includes legislative. executive and judicial branches. It ensures that no entity or branch has absolute control over the entire government. Checking and balancing is a mechanism that allows separate branches to limit the power of other branches. This system ensures that the power is shared and each branch can prevent other branches of branches that may exceed their authority or violate the Constitution. In our opinion. CC members should avoid and hold the Drep positions at the same time. The fact that an individual takes on the role of the president. the Minister of Finance and the Constitutional Judge at the same time is illogical. it is not realistic when someone assesses the first management action through the lens of the constitutional property and then through the subjective assessment of its impact on the ecosystem. These views may be conflict. A management action may  objective  in accordance with the constitution. but subjective is considered an untrue spending of ADA. It will be beneficial when there are devoted guardians of the Constitution. who are not hindered by the demand for voting from the view of Dreps or maybe even Spo. If Dreps and Spos found that the performance of CC members did not meet the requirements. then the process of dispersing the committee through the voting of Dreps and SPO must be simple. CC members should restrain voting as Dreps. they should not vote. The purpose of the article is to stimulate the reflection and research among readers. When we start the voltaire phase. it is considered as a test that is taking place. The most important attribute of the system must be its adaptability - to cure errors and strengthen its success. Transparency is the key. The right to manage and modify the system must be firmly in the hands of those holding ADA. The conservation of these qualities gives us optimism about the positive process.

Four of these will be appointed from established organizations: IOG. Emurgo and Intersect MBO. The remaining three members will be voted by the community. The last day to register candidates for this role is June 10. The list includes 22 candidates. The expected voting process starts on June 13 and will continue to June 23. you will find links to the voting platform and the list of candidates. The management journey begins with a temporary phase. creating favorable conditions for starting management in the chain safely while maintaining the compliance with the temporary constitution. The second half of 2024 was devoted to building a definitive constitution based on the community. This temporary period ended with the online versions online version of the Constitution. which is expected to take place after the Constitutional Conference in Argentina. Members of the Committee served for the one -year term. with annual elections to determine the committees composition. If Dreps and SPO expressed their vote of no confidence. an earlier election could be conducted.',\n",
       " ' Although the committees work is not paid. the proposals of the Board of Directors to make compensation are still permitted. The short voting time is set from June 13 (21:45 UTC) to June 23 (21:45 UTC). made via Summon Platform can be accessed via Cardano wallet. Election results. namely three new interim CC members. will be announced on June 26 at 12:00 UTC. All ADA owners have the opportunity to nominate themselves as a committee member. leading to a group of diverse candidates including individuals and corporations. The selection process includes no screening requirements or preliminary criteria. although candidates must answer some simple questions. These response acts as a valuable resource for the owner of ADA to make a wise vote. especially related to the candidates contribution to the Cardano ecosystem and their views on the importance of governance in the chain. Check the candidates and their answers. All ADA holders are eligible for voting. with the right to vote proportional to their ADA shares. The voting system by rank allows voters to prioritize their top three candidates and choose three replacement candidates. The limit of the candidate promotion and the absence of censored debates may affect the quality of the candidates visibility. the next election within a year will force incumbents to prove their views. while new people wish to clearly state their vision to Cardano. It is expected that the factors have not been elected - Iog. Emurgo and Intersect MBO - will compete for seats in the Constitution Committee in future elections.

On-chain administration is feasible at a minimum of a minimum summarizing a number of important concepts and milestones to coordinate with each other to provide the next generation management framework that is cohesive and reasonable. signaling the path towards Cardano on-chain administration. The management journey begins with a temporary phase to allow the on-chain management safety to start the official management rules. They include off-chain protection measures and technical barriers to protect the integrity and security of the string when Cardano upgraded to a new era. The temporary constitution is an important document that encapsulates these protective measures and must be applied to support the upgrade of Chang and the next boot period. The deployment of management features on the main networks instructions in the temporary phase. including the process of drafting the official constitution. The consultation process is currently being conducted and will take place throughout 2024. The temporary phase ends after the official Constitution. Directly approved. it is expected to take place after the Constitutional Conference in Buenos Aires. Argentina in December 2024. To maintain the temporary constitution. there will be a provisional Constitution Committee (CC) to implement the first stage of the Chang upgrade process. The temporary CC will focus on the technical and basic conformity of the first on-chain management actions submitted by the community. The interim CC will consist of seven members. each member has a one -year term to ensure a temporary phase to help maintain security and continuity.',\n",
       " ' Along with pioneering organizations IOG. Emurgo and Intersect member. the remaining three seats are opened to community members registered. Registration will open today. with voting via the summoning platform will open at the end of June to vote for the remaining three seats. According to one of the main pillars and directed by the Constitutional Committee. Intersect will facilitate an open and comprehensive voting process. so that any community member is interested in participating in the development of Cardano Administration. which can be nominated by themselves. The vote will also be opened to all ADA holders. with the voting rights to be calculated by shares and voting on the choice of ranked to vote for three additional members of the Provisional Committee. and all appropriate training activities and continuous support will be provided to committee members. We are looking for community members who are passionate about developing Cardanos management capabilities. Experienced community contributors have been active and contributed in Sanchonet. attending the Drep seminar and participating in the CIP-1694 seminar held in the summer of 2023. which is specially encouraged to register. If this is you - as an individual or representative of an entity. collective or organization - then learn about the upcoming voting process. On the basis of our knowledge and your registration application today.May 28. When Cardano moved to the Voltaire era. all ADA owners could register as an authorized representative (DREP). This opportunity is not only for them. Pool Stake (SPO) operator can also register as Drep. In the new management structure. they are not restricted to become Dreps. we will explain how it will work. The new management structure will include 3 regulatory agencies: Constitutional Committee (CC). Dreps and Spo. In the Voltaire era. the right to make decisions on administrative activities will be transferred from three founding units to the aforementioned management agencies. The initial Genesis key (administration) from the Shelley period will no longer work. In order for an approved management action. it must receive the approval of at least two of the three regulatory agencies. Some certain management activities need the approval of all three agencies. This includes actions related to hardfork and info activation. You can find the full list of all administrative actions in the table below. Please note which management agency is expected to vote for each corresponding management action. Dreps plays the most influential role in the management structure. thanks to the ability to vote for all administrative actions. These actions include disbanding the committee (putting the committee into an unconcerned state). starting hardfork. amending the protocol parameters and the ADA withdrawal from the budget. SPO holds a less powerful position than Dreps. They have no right to vote on important management actions such as modifying protocol parameters. constitutional amendments and withdrawing ADA from the fund. The image below illustrates a vote of withdrawing ADA from the budget. Only Dreps and CC have the authority to approve this administrative action. except for SPO. They do not need to be allowed to vote on such an important change.',\n",
       " ' Some parameters will be considered as the security attribute of the system. Some modified the basic protocol that Spo will also have to vote for them. These parameters belong to a security group (protocol parameters related to security). Spo has the opportunity to vote for all administrative activities. like Dreps. SPO can register as a Dreps by itself. allowing a single entity to take on a double role in management. It is important to understand that these roles are different at the level of shares. The owner of ADA has the option of authorizing their block to produce SPO and their voting rights for Dreps. These representatives are separate and independent. the owner of ADA has the option to authorize both the block of block production and their voting rights for the same entity. the same Spo. SPO also registered as Dreps holding two separate shares. The first stake is authorized for the role of SPO (representing the stake of the Stake group) and the second shares are authorized for the role of Drep. These shares are separate and independent. The owner of ADA uses the same stake authentication information for two separate authorization. The same number of ADA can be authorized twice. each time for a different purpose. Administration function reflects the mechanisms used for Stake. Certificate similar to the certificate used to register and stop working of the group are also used for similar purposes in the context of Dreps. The same thing is applied to authorization. The owner of ADA uses authorized certificates to authorize the token for the group (to have the power of block production). An equivalent certificate is used to authorize the voting for Drep. The image describes a SPO selected to register as a Drep. This individual holds two shares and plays two roles in governance. with the ability to vote as SPO and DREP. It should be noted that the owner of ADA authorized both block production and voting rights. The person who holds ADA 1 authorizes both types of power for Drep. The person holding ADA 2 only authorized the right to produce the block for him (without voting or authorizing another Drep). The person holding ADA 3 only authorized the authority to vote for him (authorized to produce blocks for another Spo). The magnitude of Stake Pool and DREP shares will change (and fluctuate) based on the authorization received from the ADA owner. SPOs choose to register as Drep should attract authorization from the owner of ADA. Their new role is Dreps independent of their stake. they are starting again. like when they first founded a group. they have their own ada token authorization options for themselves as Dreps. The image below illustrates a vote on increasing block size. The bottom left is SPO registered as Drep. He may vote on his Drep shares management action. but cannot vote with his Stake Pool. All registered spo is that Dreps can vote for all administrative actions. The decision to authorize the token for SPOs acts as Dreps and thereby empower them as an important role in governance.',\n",
       " ' only belongs to the owner of ADA. It is predicted that some ADA owners can support Drep is also Spo. while others may like Drep does not play a Spo. Some certain spo may want to become an influential Dreps. while other SPOs may choose not to pursue this path. The role of both SPO and Dreps can demand strict. in which Dreps must actively communicate and participate in governance. Outstanding in both roles can set a challenge. Although there is no limitation for Spo to become Drep. the decision to do that last belongs to Spo itself. The question of financial compensation for the role of Dreps is still the topic discussed. Although this potential position seems attractive to SPO. they should be aware of the responsibility that comes with the role of Drep. Taking on both roles can bring a certain level of risk. If a SPO acts as Drep does not fulfill its mission effectively. the ADA owner may not only authorize their voting authority to another Drep but also the right to produce their blocks for another Spo. This can lead to an unfavorable result. SPOs plan to play the Drep should consider this carefully.May 25. Suddenly. IOG announced the launch of RealFi service. This service will support the development of businesses that are guaranteed in emerging markets. The executive director of the project is John OConnor. former director of IOG. who strives to apply blockchain technology in developing countries. Charles Hoskinson considered Realfi as a pioneer in an effort to provide banking services to people without a bank with Cardano. Although the announcement is unclear about the relationship with Cardano. it is still worth to see what Realfi is and what it can solve. Read on to find out how Realfi can facilitate the application of Cardano. Realfi is a Fintech organization that provides a set of tools designed to create favorable conditions for personal credit opportunities in emerging markets. These tools help users understand. build trust and clarify personal credit opportunities in these markets. In emerging markets. small and medium -sized enterprises (SME) are the backbone of the economy. contributing up to 70% of job creation. these businesses often need more access to credit to develop. Traditional lenders in developed markets are often hesitant to lending southern hemisphere businesses due to the complexity of risk assessment. These businesses are often small and require relatively small loans. making them less attractive to lenders who want to invest in government debts with high interest rates. This hobby hinders the expansion of the real economy. The emergence of financial technology (Fintech) offers a promising solution to this issue. These Fintech companies specialize in developing tools to guarantee risks for specific business activities or loans. providing capital and promoting comprehensive economic growth. equality and job creation. They often sponsor small and medium -sized businesses with or without collateral. using data to assess the risks of the business they sponsor. Despite these advances. Fintech companies still face a significant obstacle.',\n",
       " ' They need to access capital in the balance sheet to finance their loan portfolio. but their license does not allow them to receive deposits for these activities. This gap is often filled with wholesale lending activities in the global financial ecosystem. which has been established. in which investors organize reliable intermediaries. such as investment banks. to search for transactions and assess risks. The developing markets bring new opportunities. but only when they are resolved appropriately. This is exactly the goal of the project. This is where Realfi works. RealFi toolkit includes access to financial statements. lending tape and dynamic financial model. These tools allow users to help millions of small and medium enterprises in emerging markets to access capital by making the risk of transparency. being more quantified and predictable. RealFi tools also help users monitor early warning signs of changes in their debt repayment model and modify their risk model. This process helps users to evaluate the value of SME lending categories. Realfi cooperates with Fintech lenders in emerging markets to improve and standardize their data. This improved data is shared with users to increase transparency and provide detailed information. enhance opportunities in these markets. By taking advantage of technology to expand this service scale on many different Fintech loans. RealFi enhances the trust of users and allows users to solve potential problems before they escalate. Realfi is not data - it establishes a common language and rewards to encourage users to participate in small -scale opportunities with a new partner group. Realfis ultimate goal is to equip users with the tools they need to lend confidently and effectively. thereby promoting SMEs development in emerging markets. After the lender Fintech joins. RealFi links the data points that can be measured with global impact frames. allowing users to monitor the acting data and compare them with other opportunities as easily as they monitor profits. Realfi opens up opportunities for developing markets. Users can search for new opportunities in emerging markets with higher transparency through data before. This approach not only promotes economic growth but also promotes comprehensive economic growth. the ability to integrate RealFis risk management tools with Cardanos Blockchain technology may be a significant step in the application of decentralized financial services (DEFI) in emerging markets. Like Worldmobile is trying to narrow the digital gap by connecting unpaid people. Realfi is also trying to narrow the financial gap by helping small and medium businesses in emerging markets more easily accessing credit. Both of these initiatives have the same goal of promoting comprehensive and equal. although in different fields. Cardano can provide the ideal foundation for services connected to RealFi toolkit. Blockchains ability to perform smart contracts can be used to create transparent and safe lending agreements. This can significantly reduce risks related to lending in these markets. thereby encouraging more investors to participate. As a global network. Cardano can easily connect investors from the West to small and medium enterprises in developing countries. the integration of RealFi with Cardano can also pave the way for the development of DEFI services to suit the needs of emerging markets.',\n",
       " ' By making these services more accessible. we can see an increase in economic activity and growth in these areas. The integration of RealFis risk management tools with Cardanos Blockchain technology offers promising opportunities to promote the application of DEFI services in emerging markets. promote economic growth and boost financial comprehensiveness. It is an interesting prospect that can have a deep impact on the financial future in these areas. In a tweet of Charles about Realfi. he also shared a link to a blog post of Hyperledger about decentralized identity (DID). Blog introduces an open business intermediary. a new initiative of Hyperledger Lab. aimed at autonomous digital identification applications. This agent uses Cardano blockchain as a verified data registration agency (VDR). The post was written by Atala Prism. a management solution for DID. The relationship between RealFi and Hyperledger activity mentioned in Charless tweet is still unclear immediately. it can be surmised that the RealFi solution can combine Hyperledgers DID application to verify the identities of businessmen in developing countries. When you consider a broader picture. it can be clearly seen that deefi deployment in developing countries is significantly more difficult than developed countries. The internet connection does not need to be trusted in these countries that raise a significant obstacle. a problem that the Worldmobile project aims to solve. The cooperation between Hyperledger and the Atala Prism group can offer solutions for decentralized identities. Realfi. in this puzzle. acts as a risk management solution. combined with the DEFI ecosystem. can act as a financial infrastructure operating with the technologies described above. The mission to bring banks to people without bank accounts is one of the most noble and beneficial efforts of Blockchain technology. it is also one of the most difficult challenges. The joy around the approved ETF funds sometimes overshadow this important mission. this is a pity. Initiatives like Realfi. Worldmobile. Atala Prism and other initiatives not only benefit Cardano but also for all blockchains. Each individual from developing countries has access to banking services is a step forward. Sometimes we heard that Cardanos mission in Africa was not successful or took more time than expected. Despite all obstacles and challenging journeys. this mission continues to not decline.May 21. Blockchain technology is based on the accounting system to help monitor and effectively manage the users transactions as well as the wallet balance. Bitcoin introduced the unpaid trading output model (UTXO) as an accounting mechanism. while Ethereum applied an account model. Cardano has tried to combine the strengths of both methods. resulting in an unpaid trading output system (EUTXO) used in todays Blockchain. The EUTXO model shows a unique approach to develop a smart contract and develop decentralized applications (DApps) on Bitcoin -like blockchains. In contrast to the Ethereum account -based model and other smart contract platforms. the Eutxo model brings special advantages. Similar to cash. in which the wallet can contain different denominations combined into a specific amount. UTXO represents the individual value of digital money kept in the wallet.',\n",
       " ' The balance of the wallet address is the sum of all UTXOs that have not been used from previous transactions. Bitcoin ledger records UTXO. which is the output or balance of past transactions. Each transaction includes inputs (representing the money) and the output (representing the destination of money). When UTXO is used as a new transaction input. it will be used and the new UTXO is created to reflect the updated balance. This model ensures that the value of digital tokens that users own is clearly defined by the UTXO they own. When performing the transaction. a part of UTXO will be used and the remaining amount will be returned as the change of the senders address. It is impossible to restore the spending utxo. while the new UTXO is created to show the updated balance at the relevant addresses. A significant advantage of the UTXO model is the strong protection of double spending attacks. enhancing security. expansion and privacy compared to alternative models such as account -based systems. Source: Cardano document. In the account model. each user has a separate account similar to the way the bank grant accounts to their customers. The Balance Monitoring Ledger is related to these accounts and is adjusted whenever the transaction occurs. if the user has 500 ETH in the account and converts 150 ETH to another address. their account balance is updated to 350 ETH. while the recipients account balance increases by 150 ETH. each account in the Ethereum accounting model has its own archives and coding fields. allowing communication with other accounts or addresses. If the account receives the codes. it will be executed during the transaction process and can modify the users account balance. This means that the status of every account may be affected by each newly created block. Compared to the UTXO model used by Bitcoin. the account model is easier to deploy and bring higher flexibility for smart contract capabilities. Both UTXO models and account models have corresponding limitations in the context of blockchain accounting. The UTXO model. as used in Bitcoin. lacks programming ability. this hinders the ability to support the advanced smart contracts of Blockchain. The UTXO model represents a simple  token  that can be used whole. but it lacks flexibility to determine complex financial transactions or infrastructure. This limitation limits potential and functional use can be deployed on Blockchain. the account model used by Ethereum allows programming and executing smart contracts. It provides a more expressive environment to perform complex trading logic. the account model has a challenging challenge. For each transaction. the entire global account status needs to be updated. this can become more and more heavy when the number of transactions increases. This limitation interferes with the expansion of blockchain. which can lead to obstruction and transaction processing time slower. Recognizing the limitations of both UTXO and account models. Cardano introduced the Eutxo model as a solution. The EUTXO model combines the strengths of both models. providing programming and smart contracts and solving concerns about expansion.',\n",
       " ' By expanding the UTXO model. Cardanos EUTXO model brings advanced expressions to create complex smart contracts. while maintaining security benefits and efficiency related to the UTXO method. In the standard UTXO model. transactions include output. The input refers to the current unpopular transaction outputs (UTXO) are being used. while the output representing newly created UTXOs. The Eutxo model is built on this basis and introduces two main improvements. in the Eutxo model. the addresses may contain customized logic in the form of a set. When a transaction is being authenticated by a node. it will check the set of instructions linked to the output address. If the node determines that the transaction is allowed to use a specific output as the input. it will execute the instructions. This allows the application of more complex conditions and rules for transactions. allowing for smart contracts and complex trading logic. the EUTXO model allows the output to bring customized data. This means that the output -related instructions may carry additional status information. By putting data into the output. the instructions will be more flexible and convenient. allowing them to carry and process relevant information needed to perform smart contracts. By combining these two improvements. the EUTXO model allows logical applications and complex conditions for transactions. The customized logic in the instructions may include various conditions. rules and calculations. allowing complex transaction processing. The authentication process is usually a node in the network. this logical application for transactions and execution it if it meets the necessary conditions. The EUTXO model provides the benefits of the UTXO model. such as simplicity and security. while supporting the capabilities of smart contracts. Cardano is a famous blockchain platform that uses the Eutxo model to support the performance of smart contracts on its online. Source: Cardano forum. The Eutxo model (unexplained trading output) offers some advantages compared to other accounting models. such as improved expansion ability. prediction. security and simplified trading logic. One advantage of the Eutxo model is the expansion ability. Unlike the account model that requires updating the entire Global status for each transaction. the Eutxo model is relatively cheap and does not clog the blockchain. The ability to handle transactions without updating the entire Global state helps reduce calculation costs and improve the expansion capacity of blockchain. The EUTXO model also provides predictable capabilities because the transactions are 100%stable. You can predict exactly what will happen in the transaction and only depend on the available properties of the related UTXO. ignoring the Global state. This is in stark contrast to the account model. in which transactions may not be predictable due to its dependence on the global state of the chain. this state will change after each transaction. you can completely send a transaction and within the time between sending and confirming. the general state will change in the way that makes your transactions operate in unwanted ways. In terms of security. the EUTXO model provides a safe environment to handle many activities without system errors.',\n",
       " ' Each UTXO can only be used once and completely. helping to simplify transaction verification. The success or failure of transaction authentication depends only on that transaction and its input information. making the verification of transactions easier and reduces the risk of errors or security holes. Simplified trading logic is another advantage of the Eutxo model. Transactions in the Eutxo model are checked off-chain before being sent to the blockchain. allowing effective transaction authentication. the local nature of transaction authentication allows the level of parallel. as transactions can be verified in parallel if they do not try to use the same input. This parallel improves efficiency and simplifies the analysis of possible results. the Eutxo model in Cardano provides expansion. security and transaction logic that simplifies higher than other accounting models. It provides a flexible and safe environment to perform smart contracts while maintaining efficiency and minimizing potential risks. Cardano realized the limitations of both UTXO and account models and aimed at providing applications and solutions to widely user facilities. The UTXO model lacks programming ability. while the account model encounters challenges of expansion and security. To solve these limitations. Cardano applies the output output model that has not been expanded (EUTXO). combining the best features of Ethereums programming and security capabilities. The EUTXO model provides advanced programming ability and the ability to perform smart contracts. providing the desired function for decentralized applications. In contrast to the account model. where users and smart contracts are shown in the form of accounts. the Eutxo model brings safety and higher prediction ability. Although the account model allows many activities to perform. it offers complex crops that are difficult to verify. This complexity makes smart contracts at risk of being attacked and more hacked. the Eutxo model provides a basic approach to smart contracts and decentralized applications. prioritizing safety and prediction. Although it seems more limited in some aspects. the EUTXO model minimizes serious holes related to smart contracts. bringing a safe and reliable foundation for Cardano ecosystem. By taking advantage of the EUTXO model. Cardano aims to provide a powerful platform combining programming capabilities with expansion. security and prediction ability. finally providing applications and solutions to serve the needs of users widely and prioritize safety in Blockchain ecosystem.

       " 'May 20. With the introduction of the Shelley era. the ada holders have gained their ability to authorize the money for a pool they choose. This puts Stake people in charge of producing blocks in Cardano network. If the Pool operator does not meet the expectations. the Stake has the right to delegate to another competitive pool at any time. This concept of authorization and control expands to On-Chain Administration with the introduction of the Voltaire era. The owner of ADA can now authorize their money to be authorized (DREP). These Drep acts as representing the owner of ADA when voting for administrative activities. Thanks to the proposal of improving Cardano 1694 (CIP-1694). Cardanos decentralization does not only stop at the production of blocks but also includes management. This means that changes to protocol parameters. withdrawing ADA from the project budget. hardfork activation and other administrative actions are completely under the control of the ADA owner. Cardano is considered the first of the top 10 projects to empower its community to change the main attributes of the protocol and the future direction of the project through the fund. Administration is still a relatively rarely discovered topic in the field of Blockchain technology. only a few projects choose to pursue decentralized at the project management level. Although blockchain technology has nearly ended the second decade. most of the top projects still have a single workstation implemented from the original group that launched the blockchain. thus maintaining significant control of protocol changes. One of the most noticeable battles of protocol attributes from 2015 to 2017 when a Bitcoin community part sought to increase the size of the Bitcoin block. This leads to the division in the community of Small Blockers and Big Blockers. The debate then culminated in a protocol Form. resulting in the creation of Bitcoin Cash along with the original Bitcoin. remaining the original block size. During this time. there was no official voting mechanism. leading to fierce disputes in the community and the core group. Blockchain Fork. even as a solution. is not an ideal solution because it divides the community. dilutes the development group and leads to the creation of new tokens. In the context of smart contract applications (smart contracts). a Fork Blockchain can lead to ghost tokens and ghost applications. This situation raises new questions: Who is the authority to decide the main characteristics of the project? Which pools will be responsible for ensuring fair distribution?. In an ideal scenario. the right to decide will belong to those who have the greatest benefit in choosing the best solution possible. In the context of Crypto. this group usually includes the holders of tokens. such as the people holding ADA in Cardanos case. This group represents the largest collection of independent individuals. this group may not have the necessary expertise to make complicated decisions. because not all ADA owners are IT or economic experts. The protocol development group often has the most knowledge about it. Those who operate the workstation and create blocks.',\n",
       " ' such as the Pool Stake (SPO) operator in the case of Cardano. also have significant experience. The third -party P also often has a solid understanding of the protocol. These groups may have different opinions. So who will be the last voice in the event of a dispute?. In a decentralized protocol. decision making cannot be assigned to individuals or a single group. Decisions must be made by voting. voting cannot be limited to one group. because different groups may have different priorities and incentives. Cardano will be managed by three entities: the Constitution Committee. the authorized representative (Dreps) and the Pool Stake (Spo). Dreps acts as the representative of the owner of ADA. All ADA owners have the option to register as Drep or authorize their voting authority to the Drep they choose. People may argue that the authorized representatives (Dreps) hold the most influential position because they have the right to vote for all administrative activities. Members of the Constitution Committee can be completely replaced through the voting process. Only Dreps and Pool Stake (SPO) operate the right to vote on the committees dismissal and appoint new members. SPO has no voting rights for changes in parameters and withdrawing ADA from the fund. it can be concluded that those who hold ADA or their representatives (Dreps) will hold the most power in Cardanos management structure. This is reasonable because they have the most benefits in the ecosystem. if the owner ADA wants to make a change that is not consistent with the Cardano Constitution. the Constitution Committee can stop it. The majority of ADA holders are expected to authorize their voting authority to Drep. This is a new form of authorization separate from Pool Stake authorization. The DREPS registration process and voting authorization is built on the same mechanism as the mechanisms used to register (and stop working) Pool and authorize them. This is related to the use of authorized certificates. embedded in transactions and thus becomes a permanent part of Blockchain. all information can be openly accessible to everyone through Blockchain. If operating Pool Stake (SPO) wants to become Drep. they must register. If they want to accept authorization from ADA holders. Dreps must ask them. SPO always voted in the role of Spo. Their voting rights are the shares of the pool. the number of stakes and all the representatives of the pool. Spo can also vote separately as Dreps. Spos voting rights in the role of Dreps will be different from their voting rights in the role of SPO because shares are assigned to these two different roles will be different. ADA holder has 3 options to authorize voting. They choose one (or more) Dreps registered or use one of the two automated options that are predefined. Only registered Dreps (real people) decide on management actions based on their own decisions. They can vote. no and blank. The automatic drops voting is determined in advance. Authorization of white vote means that the shares are actively marked as not to participate in management.',\n",
       " ' Such a stake will not be included in the positive voting shares. it will still be registered to receive incentives for ADA owners authorized by their voting shares. The authorization of no confidence implies that the amount of stake is counted as yes votes for all unreliable actions and no votes for all other actions. The number of authorized shares will be considered as part of the number of voting shares in operation. Some people holding ADA will do nothing. This is divided into registered (authorized) and not registered. The voting shares actively refer to the shares that can vote for administrative activities. It is a share without ADA token that has not yet been registered for management or when the owner has clearly selected the opposition option. saying their decision is never to vote. voting shares are active. including the authorized ADAs for Drep and Drep automatically. Other tokens are not used in voting. We can look at the positive voting shares from the views of the voters or not voting. only Drep or Drep automatically can vote. When checking the votes (Lovelaces). the number of authorized shares for Dreps to automatically vote. Dreps voted for a certain administrative action and all DREPS no longer operated. If Drep votes for a specific administrative action. it will reduce positive voting shares. the threshold needed to approve the administrative action. Dreps does not need to have an opinion on all administrative actions and can create favorable conditions for approval by voting by selecting a clear whiteness. you can see Drep clearly voted. This option reduces voting shares in operation. Note that Dreps is no longer active nor is it included in the voting shares in operation. The registered Dreps will need to vote regularly to be considered as activities. if DREP does not send any votes for a number of specific era (new Drepactivity parameter). Drep will be considered no longer active. The reason for marking Dreps is no longer acting because Dreps stops but still authorized shares will not leave the system in a state of no administrative action that can overcome. In the photo. you can see that Drep has lasted for the 2nd era. Drep decided to vote in the 10th era so it immediately operated until at least the end of the 13th era. The desire is that the bigger the shares as possible to vote. The legality of the vote on the list with positive voting shares. If the owner ADA does not authorize Drep or Drep automatically. they will not be able to withdraw the Stake reward. Stake rewards will continue to be paid to their Stake account so they will not lose the reward. it is only possible to choose a reward after authorizing Drep. ADA holder has some options. He can choose Drep according to his best decision or register as Drep and trust his own ADA number for himself. the owner of ADA has two other options: automatic and unreasonable Dreps voting.',\n",
       " ' One of these two options will allow Stake to withdraw the Stake reward. What will happen if Dreps approves an action that can harm the cardano. such as setting the block size to zero?. Rest assured. such a script is hard to happen. Dreps is one of the three administration agencies of Cardano. The Constitution Committee was established to prevent such adverse actions. The Constitution Committee is a group of individuals or organizations responsible for ensuring compliance with the Cardano Constitution. Members of the committee vote in the style of 1 person = 1 votes. This constitution is a document that clearly states the core values \\\\u200b\\\\u200band the principle of Cardanos direction. thereby ensuring its long -term sustainability. The role of the committee is to vote on the donation of governance activities. The committee may refuse certain administrative actions by voting no. but only when these actions conflict with the Constitution. If they exceed this boundary. the committee may be replaced. The Committee is responsible for protecting the safety. stability and vividness of Cardano. If an administrative action threatens these aspects. the committee will vote against that approval. if that action does not conflict with the Constitution. the committee will vote yes. leaving the final decision for Dreps. Although it is expected that the committee will vote no only when the administrative action is unconcerned. there may be controversial cases in which some members think that action is unconcerned. the committee can prevent approving any administrative action. it is possible to turn into a state of independence and replace the committee members. The first administrative action. the suggestion of no confidence. can only be approved by Dreps and Spos (SPO). not by the committee members. The Committee does not vote on the exemption or change of components. thresholds. terms. They only approve changes in the Constitution. The committee is always in one of two states: normal state (ie reliability) or indefinite state. In the situation of losing trust. the current committee cannot participate in administrative activities and must be replaced before any administrative actions may be approved. Can only vote on administrative actions. The replacement of the committee requires a specific management action. the new Constitution Committee. requiring the approval of both SPO and DREPS. Unlike Shelleys management. the number of committee members is not fixed and may be arbitrary. If the community wants. it is possible to elect an empty committee. abolishing the Constitution Committee effectively. As we stated at the beginning of the article. Dreps has the greatest influence on the changes of Cardano. but the committee ensures that they do not violate the constitution. And Dreps cannot harm Cardano by ratifying the management action to set blocks to 0. If there is a dispute about the block size in the cardano community. there will be a way to resolve the dispute. Each ADA owner can propose management actions with the required block size. If the number of Dreps (ie shares) will be large enough to vote for changes and reach the compulsory voting threshold.',\n",
       " ' then the change will be approved and issued (ie on-chain activation) in the next era. No group (part of the community. group. part of SPO. ) can prevent this change. If the change is in accordance with the Constitution. which will increase the size of the mass. not significantly reduced. the Constitution Committee has the obligation to vote. Note that there is no Fork Blockchain. The minority must follow the wishes of the majority. another administrative action may be proposed to reduce block size and try to receive support for this administrative action. Cardano will grow to the point of decision -making rights to those who hold ADA. They will have the right to control the fund. allowing them to prioritize the tasks to pay attention. These tasks may not only stop at developing protocols but also include aspects such as marketing initiatives or important partnerships that need investment. Becoming a delegate representative (DREP) will take time to study administrative activities and give eligible ideas for online voting. There is a consensus that Dreps should be financially rewarded. we explain some of the way DREPS can be rewarded. The discussion on how to compensate for authorized representatives (Dreps) to their contributions to Cardano is still ongoing. The owner of ADA has the right to choose to register as Drep or authorize their voting rights to the existing Drep. Becoming a Drep requires a significant commitment to time. because they need to be updated with all administrative and voting actions accordingly. It will be beneficial for the Cardano community if Dreps is a certain field and has a deep understanding of Cardano and Blockchain technology. To encourage the best individuals in the community to become Dreps. paying income is necessary. There is a consensus mechanism that Dreps should be rewarded. but the exact reward mechanism has not been decided. Five potential reward programs have been proposed. Equal rewards for top -line drips (variant 1A):. This plan ranked Dreps based on the total number of authorized shares for them (including their shares). Only the top M Dreps will receive the equivalent reward of R. The rest did not receive any payment. If m = 10. r = 500. then the first 10 drep will receive 500 ADA. The equal reward for the top drepts according to the amount of stake on the minimum threshold (variant 1b):. Similar to 1A variant. but only Dreps has attracted the number of authorized shares to account for at least 1 million ADA percentage of the total number of authorized shares to receive rewards. If m = 30 and r = 500. maximum 30 dreps can receive r rewards. Only those who have exceeded the threshold. in this example is 3. 33%. will receive the reward. Each Drep receives 500 ADA. Prize in ratio for the top drepts (variant 2a):. In this plan. the top drep m will be selected and they are paid the B reward corresponding to their stake. If m = 10 and b = 5000.',\n",
       " ' the reward will be allocated according to the ratio of shares for the top 10 drops. Prize in proportion for top drips according to the amount of stake on the minimum threshold (2b variant):. Only Dreps reaches the required threshold to enjoy the reward. After knowing the number of Dreps and the reward will be paid. the reward will be paid corresponding to the number of authorized shares of Dreps. If m = 30 and the budget b = 5000. only the Dreps reach 3. 33% to receive a ratio of the ratio. The ratio for the leading drepts in the share. accompanied by the bonus (variant 3):. This variant combines the reward program proportional to the top Dreps m reward. All Dreps received rewards from the budget B1. equal to their percentage. calculated according to the number of authorized shares for them. the Drep M topped in the rankings will receive additional rewards from the B2 budget. B2 reward can be paid by using one of the variants 1A. 1B. 2A or 2B. there is a variant of 1A (the top 10 drep received the same reward). These plans are aimed at encouraging Dreps to strive to understand proposals and attract authorization. the final decision of the reward program has not been given. Think about which options you like best.May 15. Cardano is considered a highly focused network when it comes to block production. When the conversion process from the Shelley era to the Voltaire era takes place. this decentralization will also expand to the project management. On-chain administration will be a main feature of Cardano. Each cardano workstation is operating to form the core of Cardano network. In terms of administration. every customer acts as a supervisor of protocol rules. Some certain rules. such as protocol parameters such as block size. hardfork version (hardfork) or the option of withdrawing ADA from the budget. especially suitable for administration. While the Pool Stake (SPO) operates responsible for running the Cardano workstation app on their nodes. the three founding units - IOG. Cardano Foundation and Emurgo - can take certain management actions by using the administrative key. To start an action. the number of delegates is needed. this means a consensus mechanism of 5 out of 7 main owners. Because it is a password lock. theoretical. an entity can contain multiple locks. And it can be said that these entities possess administrative courses. In the Shelley era. three independent founding entities control certain aspects of the protocol. including protocol parameters. the ability to start Hard-Fork to upgrade the protocol and withdraw ADA from the budget and reserve. There is no mechanism to replace these entities. SPOS (SPO) have run cardano workstation applications. but external changes for protocol parameters (such as block size) or ADA withdrawal from the budget may occur without the consent mechanism of the community. SPO cannot guarantee the consistency and stability of the system. is the relationship between the group and the community. operating under social contracts. The community and users must believe that the group will act for the best benefit of the project.',\n",
       " ' The management design of the Shelley era does not allow the owner of ADA to actively participate in the chain. This means that the three entities can decide on administrative actions arbitrarily. may not have the approval of the community. With the beginning of the Voltaire era. controlling these activities and other management activities are transferred to three separate management agencies. previous management courses will lose power to administrative actions. These three separate governance agencies will have a specific role in the new management framework:. New governance actions will be determined and each ADA owner can send these actions through a transaction. Members of the regulatory agency. who authorized to vote on a specific administrative action. will have the right to decide whether the action will be approved (and then issued). Diagrams of administrative actions and corresponding administrative agencies may vote for them. It should be noted that the beginning of a hardfork is the only act of voting from all organizations. Depending on the type of administrative action. determine which management agency must be approved. At least 2 management agencies must approve each administrative action. most of the members of at least two regulatory agencies must vote. It is worth noting that the distribution of voting rights will be spread on many entities. Each administrator. whether it is the Constitution Committee (CC). the authorized representative (Dreps) or Spos (SPO). will include many members. The number of governors will be flexible instead of fixed. This implies that the number of Drep members can fluctuate based on preferences. reflecting the increase and decrease of the number of activities. Dreps and SPO will vote with the system 1 lovelace = 1 vote. while the committee members will vote with the 1 person = 1 vote system. The decision making will depend on both ADA ownership and authorized voting rights. The voting right will be determined by the total authorized ADA. which is indicated by all Lovelace. Ada holders will be able to use their existing shares login information to authorize their shares not only for a selected group but also for Dreps. there will be two separate representatives. The ledger will be responsible for determining the level of shares for each Drep. This distribution will determine the number of supporting shares for each vote from DREP. DREPs voting rights include all ADA tokens authorized. including its own rights. The latest version of the shares on each Drep. as released on the boundary of the era. will be used to vote. Authorizing other Drep (or for yourself) will take effect from the new era. The owner of ADA has the option of their voting authorization (token) for their selected Drep. they can choose one of two other options: voting or no confidence. The selection of the authorization of white voting (abstain) means that the shares are positively marked as not to participate in management. The selection of no reliable authorization implies that the stake is counted as yes votes (Yes) for all unreliable actions and no) votes for all other actions.',\n",
       " ' ADA may exist in one of the states described in the chart. ADA can be authorized for Dreps. which is expected to be the most popular choice. Some ADA owners can select the white voting or voting option. These three states form a part of the registered shares. Some ADA owners can choose not to do anything. resulting in their shares not registered. The number of unused shares is not used for voting and operating similarly to the White Voting. Only the ADA tokens have been authorized for Dreps or DREP unreliable automatically to be included in the active shares. The illustration of positive voting shares. including participants can actively vote and their votes are taken into account. ADA authorization for Drep Voting and DREP obeyed the automatic behavior was predetermined.May 13. The effectiveness of smart contracts plays a key role in determining the overall status and network expansion. the Indigo protocol stands out thanks to the continuous innovation. positive emotions of the community and its smart contracts are one of the most complex contracts in DAPPS ecosystem. As the protocol is increasingly popular and used. the optimized demand has become a top priority for V2 development. The upcoming conversion process of the Indigo protocol from Plutustx (improved by plutonomy) to Aiken is a promising step in the right step. The first version. Indigo Protocol V1. was a great thing. was launched on the main internet with contracts created by Plutustx. Knowing the limitations of Plutustx language. Indigo Labs began to explore other options in the ecosystem: Plutarch. Plu-TS. Opsin. Helios. among them. After studying the available options. the group decided to select Aiken due to its easy and easy -to -read reading. With the integration of Aiken. the performance data has become superior. especially in terms of calculation and memory units. For V1. it was too late to consider any replacement solution because the number of developments was implemented before the release. In order to truly appreciate this leap. one must understand the complexity of the data and limit in Cardanos smart contract. Each of the Cardano networks is bound by two main attributes: the number of calculations (CPUs) that it uses and the memory unit it consumes. Although each step to calculate the execution time is 1 pico second on the standard machine. the memory unit indicates the number of bytes allocated by the command. These figures are not numbers; They directly affect the transaction fee and broadly speak as user experience. By optimizing the smart contracts of the Indigo protocol. we are paving the way for a more efficient Cardano ecosystem. The reduction of memory units and calculation steps for each indigo transaction means having more places for other transactions. leading to a stronger increase in pine and network. This is Cardanos future and with the advances in the Indigo protocol. we are taking a closer step to realize this vision. Join us when we study more about this transformation and discover the expressions of optimizing smart contracts on Cardano.',\n",
       " ' In the field of blockchain. the numbers often tell a story more vividly than words. When we consider the development of the Smart Contract of the Indigo protocol. it is necessary to better understand the tangible data. For those who do not have technical directions. do not worry. We have divided the data into the most understandable form to ensure that everyone can grasp the importance of the conversion process. We are comparing three separate stages in the process of developing the smart contract of the Indigo protocol:. Before going into the chart. set the basic understanding of the data we are checking:. When interpreting these charts. it is important to remember: the lower the percentage. the better. Lower percentage shows that smart contracts are consuming less resources than the maximum limit set by Cardano protocol. This means trading more efficient. lower fee and smoother user experience. We have tried to rewrite all the smart contracts of the Indigo protocol and integrate the public with our existing test set to find these numbers. In the following parts. we will learn more about the meaning of these numbers for the Indigo protocol and the larger Cardano ecosystem. A brighter horizon with Aiken when we ended this Explorer on the journey to convert the smart contracts of the Indigo protocol. one thing became extremely clear: the switch to Aiken is not simply upgrading the technique - it is also a leap forward towards an effective and expanding future for both Indigo and wider than the DAPPS Cardano ecosystem. Aikens advanced performance figures not only turn into numbers on the chart. They indicate better diabetes. allowing more transactions to be handled smoothly and faster. For Indigo users and the cardano community in general. this means more seamless experience. reducing transaction fees and stronger networks. But the benefits of Aiken did not stop there. Its outstanding performance has unlocked the previously closed doors due to Plutustx limitations. the features are considered too complicated for the first version of the Indigo protocol that can be reviewed. These advanced functions have been put aside during the development of the V1 version. now returning thanks to Aikens ability. We are very happy about these features and want to share more details with all of you. Follow the future blog post. where we will reveal some of these improvements. followed by proposing a knife about the implementation of the Indigo V2 protocol. It would be flawed without sincere thanks to the Aiken Lang team. Their dedication and expertise in creating this language plays an important role in our journey. For those who want to learn more about Aikens complexity. we encourage you to discover their work on GitHub. In the Blockchain world constantly developing. the trend is the most important thing. For Aiken as our ally. we not only keep up - we also set speeds. This is a brighter and more effective future for the Indigo protocol and Cardano ecosystem.May 11. The Cardano community is expecting Chang Hard-Fork.',\n",
       " ' as it will start the process of switching to On-Chain Administration. we will describe the administrative actions. their life cycle and the basic principles of voting. administrative activities are only approved by 3 founding units. Cardano Foundation and Emurgo. They need management key to that. There are 7 management courses. To approve management action. it is necessary to have at least 5 signatures. the founding units will be replaced by three new administrators. The new administrative agencies will be the Constitution Committee (CC). decentralized representatives (Dreps) and operate Pool Stake (SPO). this means that the number of governors will not be fixed but flexible. Any ADA owner can propose a chain administration. This requires a deposit and this amount will be refunded after the action is completed. The improvement of administrative action implies that it has been approved or expired. The deposit will be determined by the govactionDeposit parameter. Transactions related to administrative actions include Administrative Action ID. deposit. wallet address to refund deposits (after completing the action). anchoring for the necessary data to justify the actions and a summary of the trace of the previous actions of the same type (this helps avoid conflict with another type of the same type). Each action will include some components dedicated to its type:. Administrative actions are approved by online voting. Each type of governance action has its own prerequisite but always has the participation of at least two of the three management agencies. Hardfork is a special case that requires the approval of all regulatory agencies. In order for a certain approval of governance. the majority of the two management agencies have voting rights to vote and meet a specific threshold. Each threshold is an administrative parameter. Dreps and SPO votes in the Joint Stock Company (1 Lovelace = 1 votes) while members of the Constitution Committee vote in the style of 1 person = 1 vote. To ensure the legality in case of Dreps and SPO voting. the minimum acceptance threshold must not be lower than 50% of the authorized shares. As described in the image. Dreps and SPO have the right to vote on the proposal to act of unreasonable management. The threshold is set at 51% of the shares. Most of the shares in both the Dreps and SPO groups voted and the required threshold was met. This implies that governance will be issued. seven types of separate management actions have been identified. three of them are related to the Constitution Committee. Dreps has the right to make decisions on all administrative actions. The Constitution Committee is required to approve all actions. except for actions related to itself. The only exception is that the amendment of the Constitution must also receive the approval of the Committee. SPO has the right to vote for actions related to commissions. hardfork and information actions. HardFork should be special attention because it allows the community to make important. non -compatible changes against the protocol. The start of a hardfork requires changing the main version of the protocol.',\n",
       " ' to activate hardfork. most of the Spo first need to install the new version of the workstation. indicating their consensus mechanism with new changes in the protocol. the hardfork activation forms a change of a parameter. Although Spo has no right to vote on parameters changes. the main version of the protocol is the only parameter they voted. Administration action is an on-chain event began by a transaction. It has a deadline that cannot be issued. Administration activities go through four stages:. Administrative actions are only verified to ratify at the boundary of an epoch. In the same stage when taking fast photos to distribute shares. votes for administrative actions are also checked. After being approved. the actions will be prepared to issue. all administrative actions submitted will be approved and then issued or will expire. Note that no state is rejected in the life cycle of governance. All administrative actions were issued at the boundaries of Epoch after being approved. This implies that if the expiry date of the administrative action is 10 epoch. that action may be approved and issued. only 2 epoch after being submitted. In the illustration. you can observe that the action management has been proposed in the first century. The expiry date is located in the late 9th century. In the first scenario. the action was approved in the 6th century. So it was issued after the transition to Epoch 7. In the second script. at the end of Epoch 9. the action was not approved. so it was expired from the Epoch 10. If an administrative action is not issued. it means that most of all the voting groups have voted against it or the necessary voting threshold is not met. The sequence of administrative actions is determined by their acceptance order for the chain. This method effectively resolves any conflict that may arise. such as when two parameters change in competition. Entering the Voltaire era. Cardano transactions will be modified to support administrative and voting activities. Participants will be able to send transactions with administrative actions and votes. Each voting transaction includes:. For Spo and Dreps. the number of votes (yes. no or voting) is proportional to the number of Lovelace authorized for them at the time of verified action to approve. This happens each time during the Epoch transformation until the administrative action expires. If the voter chooses a white voting an act of administration. their shares will not be included in the voting shares in the active. meaning that it does not contribute to the necessary threshold to approve the action. A voter can vote many times for each administrative action. The votes sent exactly will replace all the previous votes with the same authentic information and role. the voter may flexibly change his position for any action. After the administrative action is approved. the vote will terminate and all transactions containing additional votes become invalid. For members of the Constitution Committee. each current member has a voting voucher. ensuring equal voting rights among the committee members.',\n",
       " ' Images illustrating the submission of an administrative action. This action has been sent to Epoch 1. with the expiry period set at the end of Epoch 14. which is the time expected to take the final verification process and ratify the potential for management action. Drep and SPO have the right to vote on this specific administrative action. Spo and Drep actively participate in the voting process. helping to meet the threshold of Epoch 11. By the end of Epoch 11. most shares agreed with the proposal. the administrative action was approved at the end of Epoch 11 and was issued at the beginning of Epoch 12.May 8. the third -generation Blockchain network. are making significant steps in two important areas: crime investigation and energy industry. Cardanos technology provides promising solutions to improve efficiency. transparency and security. In the field of crime investigation. Dubai police applied Cardano to optimize their investigation process. The immutability and traceability of the Cardano Blockchaino allows to record digital evidence safely and reliable in a safe and reliable way. creating favorable conditions for the cooperation between agencies and enhancing the integrity of judicial cases. This pioneering initiative can act as a model for other legal areas seeking to modernize their criminal judicial system. In the field of energy. Cardano has cooperated with Petrobras. the Brazilian oil giant. to explore the potential of blockchain technology in supply chain management. traceability of property and process automation. This cooperation can revolutionize the way of operating the energy industry. promote efficiency. sustainability and transparency. This cooperation has the potential to promote sustainability in the energy industry. Cardanos blockchain may allow monitoring carbon emissions in the entire Petrobras supply chain. which allows initiatives to reduce emissions and show responsibility to the environment. The expansion role of Cardano in technology and industry that the Dubai police application Cardano to investigate criminals and cooperative relationships with Petrobras are specific examples of Cardanos Blockchain technology that can solve complex challenges and create visible benefits in many different fields. Cardano is proving to be a flexible and powerful foundation. which can adapt to the needs of many different fields. Focusing on expansion. security and administration makes it a leading technology in the next generation of Blockchain innovation. As Cardano network continues to grow and be applied. more creative applications are expected to appear in the coming years. The Cardano community is very happy about the future of the network and the ability to create a positive impact on the world. With a strong development team. a dedicated community and strong technology. Cardano has a good position to become a leader in the digital transformation of different industries.May 7. Michael Saylor expressed his belief that no ETF delivered to Ethereum or any other Crypto. will receive approval. He further confirmed that there would be clear evidence that all types of crypto. except Bitcoin. were not registered securities. Wall Street only recognizes Bitcoin as a legal investment of Crypto. Satoshi Nakamoto. who created Bitcoin. will be the last individual to be concerned about whether Wall Street buys BTC or how governments classify Bitcoin.',\n",
       " ' The first block of Bitcoin blockchain contains the words: The Times on January 3. 2009 is about to have the second relief package for banks. This is often understood as criticizing the traditional banking system and government policies to rescue bankruptcy banks. Bitcoin is formed as a replacement for banks and governments. Saylor. along with other Bitcoin worshipers. is very happy that Bitcoin has entered the mainstream financial world. They want management agencies to prohibit crypto types. When doing so. basically. they failed the ideal of Satoshi and the principles of Bitcoin formation. The self -respectful people do not realize that they have placed themselves on the opposite side of obstacles. Nakamoto criticized the traditional banking system and Wall Street. He believes that the core issue of ordinary currency is all the trust needed for it to work. The central bank must be trusted so as not to lose tokens. but the history of traditional currency is full of violations of that belief. Perhaps the only thing Nakamoto and Saylor as well as most crypto fans agree that the banking system is operating unstable. I believe that in many other issues. Satoshis opinion will be significantly different from Saylors view. Saylor is a speculator. who seems to be calling on the government to protect his investments. Crypto competition may be able to improve the market price he holds. Satoshi aims to solve the problem of belief. especially eliminating unnecessary intermediaries. Satoshi realized the path to success in self -management transactions and peer -to -peer networks. ETF spot shows a clear contrast to what is needed for the development of Blockchain technology. one can argue that Satoshis point of view is too immersed in the cyberpunk characteristic and is not fully applied to official situations. A more basic problem is Bitcoin. from a technological perspective. which may not be fully equipped to realize the vision of Satoshi. The high volatility of all types of crypto forces individuals to continue using the Fiat currency as a means of exchange. even if they want to use BTC more. Bitcoin is difficult to lead to the collapse of the banking system or the collapse of governments. What we can predict in the coming decades is the gradual transformation of the financial system. Regulations on crypto and investment capital flows will be indispensable for this development. Satoshi may not approve this. but fairly. he may be a bit naive about the Bitcoin application roadmap. Saylors confirmation that Bitcoin is the only feasible solution for the inefficient financial sector is not necessarily accurate. After the fourth Bitcoin Halving. we are aware of the limitations of Bitcoin and may have concerns about its economic sustainability. We have to ask whether we can address these limitations and whether they have been resolved in another project. If we want to maintain our honesty and not ignore problems. we must recognize countless achievements of certain blockchain. To be fair. Bitcoin dropped in terms of technology compared to the opponent in many ways.',\n",
       " ' The efforts to bring DEFI into the Bitcoin ecosystem make these shortcomings even more clearly revealed. The most challenging aspect of the crypto application seems to be changing peoples minds. In many countries around the globe. there is still relatively strong belief in the government and its banking system. especially in developed countries. in developing countries lacking a strong or high inflation banking system. any replacement solution. including blockchain. is considered appropriate. Individuals like Saylor have influenced people to mainly see Crypto as an investment and the second is a technology with the potential to break the financial field. The trend of greedy people often dominate. the rich desire overwhelms the ambition to change the world. People with influence should not nurture greed. but instead want to change. sometimes the boundaries can merge into one. The denial of tangible technology advances in many blockchain projects not only harm these projects but also paradoxical. but also harmful to Bitcoin themselves. There are some examples to illustrate this. Bitcoin can only handle 7 transactions per second. When the demand for transactions exceeds the maximum pine of the protocol. the fee will increase. making Bitcoin basically unable to use for those who need it the most. such as individuals in developing countries. Although Lightning Network (LN) has been developed for nearly a decade. it does not seem to be the optimal solution. Most users are forced to use this network in the way of guardian. this is in contrast to Satoshis vision. Only a small part. insignificant number of BTC locked in LN. In the absence of competition between blockchain projects. today people can transfer BTC to each other through dozens of Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions that are different. Some people may be surprised when the number of BTCs locked in blockchains is significantly more competitive than LN. the market proves that the best individuals in finding the most suitable solution for themselves. Talking about numbers. only about 4.700 BTC locked in LN while 156.000 Wrapped BTC was cast on Ethereum. I am talking about a single project. If people tally all transactions per second (TPS) on all first and second -class solutions in the crypto industry. the total number can reach hundreds of TPS. Bitcoin ecosystem. including Lightning Network. accounts for only about 5% of the total number of transactions in the crypto industry. In terms of user activities on Blockchain. Bitcoin is definitely not the main trend. Stablecoin accounts for 70% of the total number of transactions in the field of crypto. a field where Bitcoin is completely excluded. Satoshi can express surprises to discover that there are individuals wishing to bring Stablecoin into the Bitcoin ecosystem. a concept of basic contrary to the original philosophy of Bitcoin. Long -term organizers are looking for stable income from their assets. In the previous cycle. many influential people have attracted them to use concentrated services similar to the degree C. This leads to the fact that many Bitcoin enthusiasts have lost their money.',\n",
       " ' If they use decentralized financial services (DEFI) on many different smart contract platforms. they can avoid such losses. Many BTC owners have practiced this for many years. Self -respectfulism interferes with the use of services safer. a concept that can suit the ideal of Satoshi. Satoshi put significant emphasis on decentralization. we cannot determine his thoughts on the current decentralization of Bitcoin. He may be depressed to know that more than half of the blocks are exploited by only two dominant groups and a few miners dominate more than half of the hash speed. What is Satoshis opinion on Cardanos decentralization? While Bitcoin has a Nakamoto coefficient. Cardano stands at 58. Will Satoshi support the governments ban on Cardano or he will tend to find inspiration and modify the Bitcoin protocol to reach the same level of decentralization? It is reasonable to think that he will support decentralization. Many self -respectful people disregard Bitcoins shortcomings and eliminate competitive projects. todays competition has surpassed Bitcoin in most aspects. except for market capitalization. self -religious people have idolized market capitalization while resigned to the technological advances of the protocol. If the competition at the level of technology has been lost. the competition at the level of narration becomes necessary. This leads to competition and attack on competitors. Some of Bitcoin worshipers even mobilized officials to set the Proof-of-Stake consent mechanism out of the law or make other unreasonable requirements. it seems that what can be prevented in terms of legal solutions will be a key solution. In the context of Bitcoin. this refers to Lightning Network or maybe even groups. the intermediary holds the separate key of the BTC token belongs to others. El Salvador made history in September 2021 when he became the first country to accept Bitcoin as a legal payment. How is Salvador people after 3 years of using Bitcoin?. A representative survey nationwide with 1.800 households in Salvador shows that the use of digital and Bitcoin payment is low. concentrated and decreasing over time. More than 60% of those who downloaded the Governments digital wallet early. Chivo. did not perform transactions after freeing Bitcoin spending with accounts and 20% has not spent bonuses. Although Bitcoin free and discounted gasoline for downloaders and using crypto applications. the download is still delayed and the use in daily life is not popular. Bitcoin technology is expected to be used to transfer money. Although Chivo is not significantly used by the population. Stablecoin USDC has begun to be used for the same purpose. One of the reasons why El Salvador people do not accept Bitcoin is its high volatility. Although Bitcoin received support from the government and competitive solutions were rejected. some people went to Stablecoin. It can be said that self -religiousism prevents El Salvador from finding a solution that suits them more than Bitcoin. Turns out in poor areas. people are starting to use Stablecoin supported in USD. I understand that people want to consider Bitcoin as a dominant payment network.',\n",
       " ' the exchange must be stable in the short term and medium term. Self -respect people should understand that Bitcoin is not suitable for everyone. Individuals like Saylor seem to ignore the fact that it is impossible to prevent technological progress. As soon as a new technology. such as Blockchain. appears. people begin to improve and innovate it. The Bitcoin community has chosen to update the Bitcoin protocol carefully. which is why it is not surprising that other projects lead in innovation. Newer projects like Cardano are not only supported by superior technology but also by the vast community. Self -religious people may be surprised to find out that many people like decentralization or they use many projects at the same time. They may be surprised to learn that many individuals who have been passionate about Bitcoin have become fans of other projects for many reasons. It is silly to evaluate people about their choice. We should only accept that people can make their own views and the variety of views and hobbies is beneficial. Consider what it would be like if Ford wanted the government to prohibit car manufacturers from competing or if Microsoft asked to prohibit competitive operating systems. The monopoly is not beneficial to the market. Why aspire to the monopoly money? Why not many types of competitive crypto?. The competitive environment has brought clear results in the form of decentralization. programming ability. long -term economic sustainability and higher expansion capacity than Bitcoin. Without competition. DEFI will not exist. And do you know which Bitcoin community wants to build? DEFI. similar DEFI services they see elsewhere. Let blockchain Proof-of-work coexist with blockchain proof-of-stake. Let new concepts appear. The development of any complex technology has never stopped. Even money has a rich renovation history. It is naive to believe that the development of currency will end with Bitcoin. What happens if the best form of money can be programmed? What will happen if the new money does not need supervisors? What will happen if the governance can grow around the new currency? And why dont we want to test to determine which money is the best? Why do we have to be satisfied with the fact that miners. some major mining companies today. will determine the innovation in Bitcoin?. There are many questions that we have no answers. The only option is to constantly build and not be afraid of technological progress can bring changes. Saylor is concerned about technological advances because he is afraid of changing. If he is no longer a Bitcoin worship. he may be at risk of losing a part of his reputation. The good news is that both Saylor and governments cannot prevent technological progress. Bitcoin shows a free mechanism. It should be indifferent to ideas. whether they come from banks or governments. and whether they support support or ban or not. Satoshi gave us this free tool. Characters like Saylor are turning Bitcoin into a tool of tyranny. Self -respect people try to separate society into the elite Bitcoin and the rest.',\n",
       " ' who owns 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. can nurture the desire to become a new global leader. The lack of an alternative means lack of freedom. The absence of other options and forced to follow the current situation will hinder social development and technological progress. Saylor is the one who is loved by many people who are self -respect. actually just because he constantly buys BTC. his view is different from Satoshis vision in many ways. Sympathizing with Saylor is basically agreeing to ban competition and technological progress. ETFs approval is not the final stop for Bitcoin and other crypto projects. And should we refuse to approve Cardano ETF because it does not match Satoshis vision? ETF will simply be part of the crypto application and there is no reason to fight it. Let all projects have the same conditions to succeed. Blockchain projects must compete with each other at technology level. people should not become the struggle for a specific project and turn it into a religion. People should choose a crypto like car or operating system. Priority characteristics for specific use purposes will be the decisive factor. Very wide range. from currency to decentralization. cash flow. token. DID. Sometimes it is said that Cardano will accomplish what Satoshi has begun. To a greater level. it can be understood like that. because Cardano has a Nakamoto consensus mechanism. limited amount of money. using UTXO model and other instructions with Ethereum smart contracts in many ways. Cardano has the ambition to deploy on-chain management and have a project fund. and the IOG group plans to significantly increase the expansion of layer 1. But it is not about technology. The community is also an important aspect. Everyone must adjust themselves from the main view of the community and the ideal of the community. Saylor is a problem for the Bitcoin community. because not everyone shared their views. In any major community. a power competition will begin and different groups will begin to have different views. the community still has to be attractive to new members. Cardano is an existing evidence that can achieve significant decentralization in which everyone holding tokens can participate. If Ouroboros Leios can be transferred. it will be evidence that the ability to expand the Nakamoto consensus may increase. The original property feature is a good example of how token in the UTXO model. Plutus platform is evidence of how to achieve high programming capabilities. The Bitcoin community can get a lot of inspiration from Cardano. It is stupid to ignore technological progress. hoping no one will pay attention to it or even ask the government to ban it. Everyone is smart. They will appreciate technology progress sooner or later. Groups of some Cardano projects are trying to apply their experience to the UTXO model in Bitcoin ecosystem. It is positive to see Bitcoin and Cardano begin to connect with each other. Cardano can become a smart contract for Bitcoin. It is no use of becoming a Bitcoin worship as well as it is not helpful when becoming a self -respect for Cardano or an Ethereum self -respect.',\n",

Wall street. ban and the discourse of competitive protocols that hinder the application of real crypto. Saylor is damaging the Bitcoin ecosystem and does not have the opportunity to prevent competition or cause the government to ban it. Sometimes I encountered the view that everyone just wanted to speculate. so technology progress did not mean anything. That does not make any sense. because the growth potential must be exhausted at some point and it benefits people when guessing something else. such as a competitive blockchain. The basis for stability and sustainability is the efficiency and direct utility of the network. This cannot be achieved without the most appropriate technology.May 1. The emerging string efforts to consolidate the Ethereum and Cardano ecosystems with Tenderly and Charli3. with dozens of other boot partners. Apex Fusion is preparing to launch by announcing a group of partnerships in the ecosystem. The new network will support businesses and businesses from the Ethereum virtual machine ecosystem (EVM) and the trading output world that has not been spent (UTXO). the real interactive ability between these two accounting methods has been shown to be difficult to overcome. APEX Fusion is set to prevent fragmentation from blockchain by launching a new chain network with natural interaction. Tenderly. a comprehensive infrastructure development enterprise from the Ethereum ecosystem. is joining the ranks of other projects being implemented on APEX Fusion. Their services include on-chain deployment. integrated development environment and support for decentralized projects. Ivan Bjelajac. Vice President of Strategy at Tenderly and co -author of Polygon Edge commented on how Tenderly will support Nexus. APEX Fusions EVM chain and also added that he loves anti -pride vision in uniting Ethereum. Cardano and Cosmos ecosystems. Tenderly is one of many organizations in the Ethereum field that has announced the support of the new ecosystem of Apex First. Ethernal. Zeeve and MVP Workshop have publicly expressed their commitment to the new network on X. formerly Twitter. Charli3 from the world of Cardano also announced that they would start building on the multi -chain of Apex First. Charli3 is the first decentralized Oracle network for Blockchain Cardano. It is aimed at providing services for UTXO -based chains. Charli3\\\\s Damon Zwarich said: We are very happy at the vision of Apex First in turning the dream of EVM compatibility and UTXO into reality. TXPIPE and EternL will also participate in the new platform to merge the ecosystems. Apex Fusion network. founded by a group of multi -sector veterans from Ethereum and Cardano. aims to create a multi -chain network for the purpose of anti -fragmentation of web3 context for everyone. Their core contributors focused on efforts before launching to find partners to start infrastructure development from two major ecosystems. Sava Savic. the core contributor to the Apex Fusion ecosystem and the Output Global alumni. said: “When we launch Apex Fusion. we want quality rather than quantity. We are honored to have many amazing projects to share our values \\\\u200b\\\\u200band in accordance with our vision of a web3 that is not fragmented.',\n",
       " ' This is a great start but it is the beginning. Apex Fusion is currently running a private testing network but it will soon be made public. New projects from the world of EVM and UTXO are being announced as a partner to launch more. The goal of APEX Fusion is to overcome the anticipation that hinders the decentralized context. Its initial impact. shown by buying top projects like Cardano and Ethereum. clearly proves that it will be a change factor.April 28. Decentric supporters and Blockchain technology will surely welcome the establishment of a new group specializing in supporting open source initiatives. That is the reason for the establishment of Pragma. a non -profit association operated by members. This association includes outstanding contributors to the Cardano ecosystem. including Cardano Foundation. Blink Labs. DCSPark. Sundae Labs and TXPIP. Unified by a common goal. these five founding units pledged to nurture an open source ecosystem as beyond Cardano so that other blockchain platforms. Pragmas initial priority will be consolidating the open source initiatives in the Cardano ecosystem. especially focusing on Aiken and Amaru projects. Aiken acts as a Script language instead of Cardano. providing a feasible replacement for Plutus. It allows writing a simpler and more effective script while still maintaining the same security. It is fair to think that Aiken is emerging as a favorite choice for most developers in the Cardano ecosystem. With the support of Pragma. Aiken has the potential to develop into the main programming language for a series of cardano applications. Amaru is a replacement (full) cardano workstation app. developed in Rust. It can work combining and maintain fully compatibility with the existing Haskell workstation app. The diversity in this workstation options strengthens the strength of the Cardano ecosystem. It should be noted that there are many replacement workstations that can slow down the growth speed and deploy improvements. if the IOG group integrates the Input Endorser feature into the Haskell workstation application. the Amaru group will be required to copy this way of deployment in their workstation app. This can lead to a delay in general progress. The alternative programming language and diverse workstation facilities are very important in any decentralized ecosystem. The only suitable thing is that such a mission is under the auspices of an organization based on members. especially an organization including famous entities with proven achievements. Pragma is set to expand its support for more open projects and tools. maybe even projects from different ecosystems. Professionals provided by founding units will ensure the creation of high quality open source projects. These projects. supported by such strong support. can become feasible options for businesses or governments. Pragma is not designed to act as a sponsor (similar to Catalyst). Its main role is to serve as a collective organization for open source development initiatives. This implies that Pragma projects will need to look for alternative funding. Pragma marks the organization based on the second members in the Cardano ecosystem. after Intersect. Intersect has a deeper mission.',\n",
       " ' paying special attention to management. Intersect took over the control of the GitHub warehouse of the Cardano project from the IOG group and is currently responsible for managing it. the focus of Pragma is to develop open source. Pragma and Intersect are not competitive but complement each other in the corresponding key areas. This announcement has caused significant joy in the Cardano community. Some projects have declared the intention of applying the open source model completely. other outstanding community entities have expressed their willingness to cooperate. it is reasonable when the member of Pragma can be expanded in the future. this will not happen before 2025. The members of Pragma want to start the link with a number of key projects and achieve determined milestones. They want to find out what suits them before they can expand the organization. The name Pragma cleverly reflects the organizations actual approach to address important aspects of ecosystem development. Introducing Amaru. a replacement workstation of Cardano. in order to improve the strong and decentralization of the ecosystem. Aiken. as an alternative programming language. has the potential to attract more developers into the ecosystem and create favorable conditions for creating new applications. We wish the organization new luck and success.April 23. Cardano has been a prominent player in the bustling world of Crypto and Blockchain network. It provides a complex blockchain platform for expansion. sustainability and decentralized management. As an intellectual product of the Ethereum Charles Hoskinson. Cardano sets the goal of resolving the limitations of existing blockchain systems and creating its foothold in digital asset ecosystems. often known as the third -generation Blockchain. highlighted by strict scientific approaches. drawn from academic research and scientific research to strengthen its design and development. Unlike the previous versions. Cardano applied classification architecture. separating the payment layer responsible for transactions (Cardano. CSL payment class) from the calculation class to support smart contracts (Cardano. CCL calculation class). This separation enhances the ability to expand. security and flexibility. paving the way for a powerful ecosystem including decentralized applications (DApps) and original property. Although Cardano and Ethereum share the common goals to allow decentralized applications and issuance of digital assets. they differ in some main aspects:. Despite his promise and potential. Cardano faces certain limitations and criticisms:. Cardanos superior ecosystem. lower transaction fees. stake opportunities and comparison with other blockchain emphasize its growth and long -term application potential. As investors and developers increasingly realize the value proposal that Cardano brings. it is considered the lighthouse of innovation and progress in the context of Crypto has always changed. With a steadfast commitment of the tightness in science. empowering the community and the ability to interact. Cardano sought to redefine the future of finance. governance and moreover. open up new opportunities and capabilities for individuals and organizations around the world.

Microsoft and Elon Musk. some projects are aiming to break down the status quo. eliminate social media from the seemingly iron and steel clamps of these giant entities and create a future decentralized social media with full benefits for users. Here we will mention what Socialfi is. the latest trends of the industry and the Socialfi platform are built on Cardano and other blockchains. Socialfi. short for Social Finance. projects for decentralized social media by creating platforms. through tokens. introducing financial models to social media allows users to make money through interactions and content creation. This can be done through many different models. including access to NFT port. interactive token tokens and income distribution from advertising. All this aims to break the creative economy. the decentralized nature of Socialfi also gives users more control over the data they create and increase the freedom of speech on such platforms. These platforms may also allow users to make financial transactions with smart contracts. These platforms are usually managed by the knife of the token owner. often using the platform token token. Along with Depin and Rwa. Socialfi is continuing to achieve attraction by 2024. The Socialfi Summit was held in Dubai in January to highlight the potential of Socialfi and the work being implemented in this field. Here we have highlighted the trends in Socialfi right now. In addition to these technological and improving advances. it tends to farming. where users create content to exploit the maximum possible value from these platforms. There are many figures to assess the popularity of the Socialfi project. Here we have listed some of the largest and most aggressive platforms.

Winter Protocol is an open source solution. ready to use for traceability and tokens. It offers a range of APIs and toolkets. designed to adjust traceability solutions and tokens for diverse applications. Initially formed and launched on ERGO to serve the requirements of the Palmyra platform. Winter Protocol expanded its scope of activities to be present in the Cardano ecosystem. This expansion is to meet the increasing needs of the Cardano community on strong and reliable tools and solutions. we will explain the basic principles of Winter Protocol. The trend is increasing in large goods import markets. where governments begin to ask businesses to comply with the rules of traceability. This is happening in both the US and the EU. In the United States. traceability products are often part of the required compliance requirement. the FDA has established a rules of food traceability. requiring additional traceability for some foods.',\n",
       " ' This rule aims to allow faster determination and quickly removing foods that can be plutus from the market. thereby reducing disease and/or food deaths. In the EU. the requirements of traceability exist to ensure that the product can be traced from an importer or manufacturer. production facility and even a certain production cycle. This is especially important because it allows market monitoring agencies to identify and search unsafe and non -compliance products. The general provisions of the Food Law define the possibility of traceability is the ability to track and monitor food. animal feed and raw materials through all stages of production. processing and distribution. For businesses. these traceability rules mean that they need to have a system to monitor their products throughout the supply chain. This not only includes monitoring the origin of raw materials but also ensuring the integrity of all parties involved. understanding the complexity of the production process and resolving environmental footprints in the entire production cycle. The group has faced a decision: Creating a completely new system based on tokens. thereby ignoring the EPCIS standard that has established or designed a system to comply with the EPCIS standard. The second option brings benefits in the use of existing infrastructure of the GTIN and other commercial decomposition numbers. EPCIS complies with the regulations. After considering. the group decided that compliance with the existing super data standard is the most reasonable choice. This approach is mainly related to JSON manipulation. creating super data and creating single tokens for each event (EPCIS event). To fully understand the operations of Winter Protocol. it is essential to understand the purpose and application of EPCIS standard and GTIN decentralization code. EPCIS (electronic product code information service) is the GS1 standard that allows display in organizations as well as on the entire supply chain of trading partners and other stakeholders. It provides what. when. where. why and how of the product and other assets. allows to capture and share information that can interact with the state. position. motion and product journey chain. EPCIS is used in electronic data exchange transactions. especially related to the monitoring and search of products in the supply chain. The importance of EPCIS lies in the ability to provide visibility and traceability in real time of products and assets when they move in the supply chain. It streamlines the activities of the supply chain by providing a standardized framework to collect and share data. EPCIS standard identifies some types of events. These events show actions in the real world related to product or assets in the supply chain:. This is a supply chain diagram that includes an EPCIS event that can look like. two sets of items were expressed by two roses. These sets were later stored in a shipping container. indicating a synthetic event. The corresponding division event will be related to removing these sets from the storage area. If the two items are combined to form a new product. this process is shown by a conversion event.',\n",
       " ' the product must undergo quality control. described by an observation event. Global commercial code (GTIN) is a decentralized code for commercial development by GS1 international organization. The company can use GTIN to only identify all its commercial products. GS1 defines commercial products or services that are valued. ordered or invoice at any point in the supply chain. GTIN is often used to identify commercial products at EPCIS events. Winter Protocol is inspired and designed to suit the EPCIS standard. Super data contains output heads with GTIN numbers. These subjects represent commercial goods. Explain the difference between individual and class identification. Class level identification refers to identifying a group of identical items in all aspects. This is usually what we think of when considering product identification codes. all 12 ounce cans of a specific soda brand will have the same gtin because they are the same product. the identification of the version. also known as adequate sequential identification. and take one step more. It provides the ability to identify each individual product version. This means that each 12 ounce soda can of the specific soda brand will have a single identification code. allowing each product version to be monitored or searched individually. This is especially useful in the supply chain management because it allows accurate correlation of observations at different times in the supply chain. Winter Protocol produces irreplaceable tokens (NFT) on the Ergo or Cardano blockchain. each token representing an EPCIS event. Each NFT acts as a single identification code (ID) for its corresponding EPCIS event. creating an invariant record of events on Blockchain. When users enter the new supply chain management data. that data is considered a specific EPCIS event. Winter Protocol responded by creating a new NFT and storing current super data in IPFS. The NFT casting involves creating and sending transactions. NFT is created according to the users input information in a certain supply chain. It is not necessary to have a predetermined scenario. prefabricated NFT. NFT only acts as the only identification code and a means of marking time on Blockchain. NFT includes a reference super data ID. The hash function. created from super data and is linked to NFT. ensuring the integrity of the data. All efforts to change the data stored in IPFS can be detected through the hash function. Alice is importing a new EPCis event through the application. The application is responsible for creating new NFT and recording the JSON super data in IPFS. ID plays a link between NFT and super data. The hash function in NFT ensures the integrity of data in IPFS. The supply chain can be visualized as an EPCIS event string. indicated by the link chain or NFT chart. Winter Protocol acts as a cursor to the data stored in IPFS. protected by time marks in the blockchain. Each EPCIS (or NFT) event is linked to super data. This super data includes information about the output items. These items are shown by the output objects (JSON data) including their GTIN.',\n",
       " ' The super data also contains reference to NFT (ID) that the inputs originate from there. ensuring the link of the NFT and thereby string the EPCIS events. Each new event will return to the previous event. This allows monitoring all events from the beginning of the production cycle. The most important point that helps the protocol operate is the Eutxo model. This can help the supply chain as a link or chart of UTXO (box in ERGO) in which each UTXO represents an EPCIS event. there are two EPCIS events with ID 1 and 2. both initiated by Alice and an event with ID 3. initiated by Bob. The NFT event has a 3 -pointed ID to the NFT 2 event through its super data. the NFT 2 event pointed to the NFT 1 event. without the previous event. Evement 1 can be a commission. event 2 can be a transition and event 3 can be an observation. When users enter the event ID into the application. they will be able to view all related super data stored in IPFS. This super data includes information about related subjects. processing steps. It also contains reference to the event ID that the input object originates. This allows the construction of the entire link chain or chart of the supply chain. The transfer of commercial ownership from one entity to another is an EPCIS event. This event requires new NFT and stores super data in IPFS. Super data encapsulates all the essential details of new owners and inputs. including their GTIN. The ownership of items is only determined by the records in the blockchain and IPFS. Item ownership does not depend on the owner of the NFT event. The new owner can create new events and reference objects (including GTIN) from the previous data of the event as an input. On the ERGO platform. UTXO ownership can be guaranteed by recording the users signature to the box registration book. This implies that any new change or activity related to this box can only be performed by the owner of the box. because most of the manufacturers that the group are currently in collaboration lack technical expertise to handle crypto and crypto wallets. the signature belongs to Palmyra. In case of determining the error in the recorded data. the correction event must be started with edited information. This process includes the creation of new NFT and new data storage. when reviewing the history of pursuit information. both the correction event and the initial error event will be displayed. It should be noted that the events are not encoded. The final product can be performed (but not necessary) after it escapes the supply chain cycle. In the encryption process of items. it may include information that links it with the number of GTIN and NFT of the most recent EPCis event that it comes from. an encrypted item can refer to the entire production cycle (all EPCis events). Observe the effectiveness of Winter Protocol. It can record data almost unlimited thanks to the IPFS storage.',\n",
       " ' The integrity of the supply chain and data is protected through Blockchain. The items are not represented by NFT. because the management of a large number of separate tokens will set too high requirements for Blockchain resources. a farmer raising dairy cows for cow milk to produce standard milk boxes with specific volume. Items being sold as a standard carton. It will have its own GTIN and the commission EPCIS event corresponds to the related super data. a cheese producer undergo a number of steps in the production process of cheese. each step has traceability events. The final step in their chain will be producing a standardized cheese for sale to retailers. Each of these cheese formats receives their own identity. complying with the GTIN standard. Winter Protocol can develop into a sidechain on ERGO or a series of partners on Cardano. The main blockchain will ensure security. while specialized networks will save more resources for the main blockchain. The law will force small and medium business owners to establish traceability. The deployment of these systems may be complicated and may need significant investment in technology and process modifications. companies should carefully evaluate their requirements and special abilities when determining the traceability method. An economic solution complies with regulations. available on Ergo and Cardano blockchain. which can be an appropriate choice for many entrepreneurs. Emurgo announced the strategic alliance with Huawei Cloud. This cooperation aims to consolidate Cardano network by expanding support for Node Cardano on Huawei Cloud platform. As part of this strategic cooperation. Emurgo will set up Node Cardano on Huawei Cloud. integrating Huaweis powerful Cloud infrastructure into Cardanos Blockchain ecosystem. This move will promote growth and accelerate the application of Web3 in Asia Pacific and Africa. This announcement is the first step in the cooperation between Emurgo and Huawei. Development application groups (DApps) can flexibly use different Cloud services. as long as these services support their requirements. Huawei Cloud may have been used to run Node Cardano even without an official partnership. such cooperation often brings advanced support and easy deployment for Node Cardano. Cloud service providers are interested in expanding user base and web3 marketing is developing. they have begun to expand to support blockchain projects. It is reasonable to predict that all important blockchain projects will eventually receive support from these Cloud service providers. We have witnessed some such partnerships. Google Cloud has officially expanded to support Ethereum. AWS provides support for blockchain projects such as Solana. Algorand and Avalanche. and many other projects. It should be noted that regardless of the official cooperation notice. the nodes of the related projects can operate on many Cloud services. These partnerships are often aimed at improving the easy deployment and better support for these projects. Huawei Cloud has announced that they support more than 8 public blockchain. including Ethereum and Tron. And Cardano is another example. cooperation is very significant. This announcement is especially attractive because it suggests potential developments in the future that can promote the cardano application.',\n",
       " ' specific information about these potential developments is still unclear in the notice. Cloud services. although there is a global approach. may have a market location affected by the geographical location of the supplier. Huawei holds an important position in the Asian Cloud market. while other major suppliers like AWS and Azure are headquartered in the West. In recent years. Huawei Cloud has quickly promoted to become the second largest Cloud supplier in China. the third in Thailand and the fourth in developing markets in the Asia -Pacific region. marking this as the fastest growing Cloud supplier in those fields. The geographical location of the Cloud service provider can affect their market position. Factors such as local regulations. data sovereignty and network latency can make local Cloud suppliers more attractive in certain areas. Cardanos mission is closely linked to African continent. The common goals of the Cardano and Huawei ecosystems are even more important to this cooperative relationship. The success of the cooperative relationship between Emurgo and Huawei will be the creation of a new service to take advantage of Cardanos decentralized features. with the support of Cloud. an African country will easily use such decentralized services. This cooperation may be an important component in this larger picture. All ecosystems should honor the formation of partnerships and evaluate their importance. The alliance between Emurgo and Huawei has potential significance. as long as it paves the way for additional advances related to the cardano application. only time can answer. It was praiseworthy when Emurgo made this notice. showing its continuous activity in the Cardano ecosystem. It would be beneficial if such statements were made more often. congratulations to the group responsible for establishing this cooperative relationship. Each step towards success is valuable.April 14. 2024 *- Share this article on Twitter | Facebook | Telegram **. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum. operating in the traditional fees market. Cardano uses a fixed and predictable fee system. These fees. although not too high. are placed at the level that can prevent spam attacks effectively. Solanas extremely low transaction fee is a double -edged sword. Although they make transactions at affordable prices. they also lead to high failure rate - currently. about 75% of user transactions are not implemented. The network is filled with transactions created by BOT. In addition to transaction fees. the online layer plays an important role in preventing spam transactions. Node Cardano uses mem-pool and its protocol is designed in a way that is aimed at demand. This design allows each node and all peer -to -peer node nodes to be linked to it to adjust the speed of data and the amount of data remaining. Solana does not use mem-pool. all transactions are transferred directly to the next authentic person. This article will clarify why sending solana spam is relatively easy while doing so with Cardano is a challenge. Determining the appropriate network usage fee is a challenge that every blockchain group faces. These fees will reflect the actual cost of the use of computer resources in the distributed network.',\n",
       " ' The group must consider the needs of both network operators. operators of block production nodes and users. While operators target maximum rewards. users prefer the minimum fee. Balancing these benefits is very important. Traditional fees. like markets used in Bitcoin or Ethereum. have disadvantages. As the network usage level increases. the fee also increases. making the network monopoly and can only access to those who are capable of paying high costs. Cardano uses fixed fees and can be predicted. Users have to pay the same fee for transactions of the same scale. The fee consists of a fixed component and a variable component based on the trading size in byte. For 200 -byte transactions on Cardano. the exact fee is 0. 164271 ADA - NO. no less. This fee is equivalent to about 0. 1 USD. As the price of ADA increased. the dollar value of the fee also increased. Compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. using the traditional fee market where the fee increases according to the network demand. this fee is low. On Ethereum. the fee can range from 1 to 100 USD (and may be higher). Users still have to pay even when the transaction fails. The fee structure of Solana consists of two parts: basic fee and priority fee. The basic fee is a fixed fee for each transaction. the basic fee is set into 0. 000005 solo per signature. The priority fee is the additional additional fee that users can pay to increase their trading ability to be put into the block. This is especially useful for time -sensitive transactions. The fee is unstable and may change over time. Similar to networks using fees. if the network is used more. the transaction cost on Solana ranges from 0. 00001 to 0. 00003 Sol. equivalent to about 0. 001 USD to 0. 005 USD. When compared to Cardano. Solanas fee is significantly lower. the difference is about 20 to 100 times. Although the low fee is attractive to users. making Solana a comprehensive network. they are not protected from spam transactions. BOT can send thousands of transactions a day with only a few dollars. This is why now. 75% of user transactions on Solana fail. Another important aspect to consider when calculating network usage fee is the long -term economic sustainability of any decentralized blockchain. This implies that the fee must be sufficient to cover operating costs. Low charges can be balanced by infinite tokens. but this may reduce the token value over time due to endless inflation. Solana operates based on infinite token inflation. while Cardano has the amount determined to be circulated. its hard to determine which strategy is more beneficial. Returning to the topic of protecting spam transactions. the traditional fee market is used by Bitcoin and Ethereum as an effective tool to prevent spam transactions. the fee on Cardano is relatively high. making the efforts to send spam on the internet become expensive. Solanas fee is so low that it makes spam so cheap.',\n",
       " ' Blockchain network must be able to access globally and regardless of user treatment. It does not require any customer (KYC) procedure. the network cannot censors transactions. Any user paying for a transaction must have a reasonable guarantee that their transactions will be included in the upcoming block. the introduction of any form of filtration is not feasible. The only limitation in using the network is the transaction fee. In order for a transaction to be put into a block and permanently recorded in the ledger. it must go through two basic layers: the network layer and the consensus layer. the transaction was processed by the network layer at the node. If it successfully meets the authentication criteria of this class. it will switch to a consensus layer. The consensus layer is responsible for determining the content of the new blocks and achieving a mass consensus mechanism on all nodes in the network. These principles general for all blockchain networks. although they may vary in detail. In certain blockchains. where transactions show unknown behaviors. transactions can switch to consensus layers and then fail. The reasons for this may vary. the conditions for making smart contract transactions at the expectation of users may not be met. And the transaction is made but failed even though the user has paid. The current problem with Solana is not a consensus class is eliminating transactions. Rather. transactions are not even carried out from the network to the consensus class. The network layer is clogged that the node chooses to eliminate part of the transaction. The node protects itself from overloaded and may have problems. which can occur due to exhaustion of resources. Users trying to use Solana often see their transactions unsuccessful. they were asked to submit the transaction back. this may need to be done many times. This is mainly because they are competing with BOT transactions. BOT. faster and can produce significantly higher trading volume than users. dominating networks. A large number of transactions created by BOT are related to price difference transactions. It is estimated that only 10% of transactions are created by users. you can see how BOT and users compete to have transactions are put into the block through the network and consensus layers. Consider a situation of which among 100 transactions. there are 10 transactions from users and 90 transactions are from BOT. If a node decides to remove 30% of transactions. all user transactions may be removed at a certain time. If a node is overloaded. it can decide to eliminate more transactions. it is 50% of transactions. The solana network is operating and the calculated resources of the nodes are not exhausted due to interrupted transactions. there is no need to restart the network and the risk of node incident is low. Restarting also does not solve the problem with BOT. The main problem lies in the difficulty that users encounter when trying to send transactions. Although the network is running. it is basically it cannot be used.',\n",
       " ' Most transactions are put into the block created by BOT. only a few are user transactions. In the image. you can see red transactions from BOT and users who have lost nodes and some black transactions only from the BOT have reached the consensus layer and have the opportunity to be successfully handled (and stored in the ledger). It should be noted that although each user usually has a single connection to send transactions. the BOT can maintain multiple connections at the same time. This gives BOT a significant advantage. it is normal for a bot to send spam transactions to many nodes. This is because the BOT aims to handle their transactions as quickly as possible and sending transactions to multiple nodes will increase the possibility of this happening. Which node decision should be removed to avoid being overloaded by transactions is a complex issue. In the network layer. the analysis of transaction content is a challenge due to the need for calculated resources to analyze the content of the message. the distinction between user transactions and BOT transactions created is almost impossible. The BOT creates spam transactions. but from the viewpoint of the network and the consensus layer. it may be a valid transaction. It is a valid spam transaction. The simplest strategy may be randomly eliminating transactions. but this does not solve the problem effectively. When Node Solana cancel the transaction. the transaction fee will not be paid. This is because the transaction fee is only arising when the transaction is handled successfully and is put into the block. If a transaction is canceled before going to the consensus class. it is considered that the transaction has never been sent and therefore not charged. The challenge that Solanas group faces is even if the transactions created by BOT are put into a block. the relevant fees are still negligible compared to the potential price difference. This is true even if most of the transactions are unsuccessful in the consensus and pay fees. Every day. Solana processes about 25 million user transactions. From these transactions. the user fee is ranging from $ 25.000 to $ 100. It is estimated that user transactions account for about 10% of the total. of which BOT accounts for 90%. This implies that spam people will have to spend about $ 50.000 (250 soly) per day for transaction fees. Ethereum earned about 400 ETH daily fees. equivalent to about 1. 5 million USD. sending Ethereum spam will be about 30 times more expensive than sending Solana spam. Cardano protocol collected about $ 12. This figure is nearly five times less than Solana. And one may wonder why Cardano is not filled with spam transactions. We will go deep into the online layer to answer this question in the next section of the article. It should be realized that if Cardano can handle the same amount of transactions like Solana and this ability can be achieved with Input Endorsers. the network will charge about US $ 2.',\n",
       " ' 5 million per day. Protecting spam will be enough. A single block in the Cardano blockchain can accommodate about 250 to 300 basic transactions. If we consider the transaction fee of 0. 1 USD per block. Cardano will receive an income of 25 to 30 USD per block. Given that Cardano creates a new block every 20 seconds. this means that the daily output is 4.320 blocks. If all these blocks are only full of valid spam transactions. the individual starting the attack will be subject to daily transaction costs exceeding US $ 100. In the previous section of the article. we talk about the network class from the point of point of the node. That has been simplified. Both users and BOT are connected to the authentication process through the RPC server. Users do not directly know who the authentic person is. So they send their transactions to the RPC server to transfer transactions to the verification person and the next authentic person according to the schedule of the main authentication person. This schedule is known in advance. Follow the life cycle of Solana transactions. Solana transactions are not included in Mem-Pool as in other networks. they must be sent directly as the UDP package to the head of the consensus protocol. RPC servers know the schedule of the leader will send transactions directly to the authentic people will create blocks in the next round. Solana tries to handle all transactions sent as soon as possible. Instead of dispersing transactions to all nodes (it takes time). transactions are shifted to the next authentication process with the assumption that they will all be included in the next block. To put it more simply. the authentic person is easily attacked by BOT through a limited number of RPC servers. This is because all transactions are transferred by these servers to the next verification. When the mass of a spam attack exceeds the capabilities of some solana blocks. it will lead to network congestion. the authentic person begins to eliminate transactions. This means that BOTs do not have to target many Solana authentication or rather RPC server online because according to the design. all new transactions are redirected to the next authentication process. who can quickly overwhelm transactions. you can see how RPC servers transfer all transactions to the Node 1. This node can easily be overloaded with transactions and start eliminating them. Immediately after Node 1 creates a block. the RPC servers will push all transactions to the next authentication process. such as Node 2. I have simplified it to make it easier to understand. The location for sending transactions and specific RPC servers used is not relevant. because all RPC servers are aimed at transacting to the next authentic people. When the network is not blocked. the system will operate smoothly. providing users to confirm the transaction almost immediately. the architecture of the network. along with the unfortunate low fee. makes this network vulnerable to spam. It should be added that.',\n",
       " ' in addition to user transactions. voting transactions are an important part of the Solana network consent mechanism. Those who authenticate in the solana network send each other to confirm the transaction. These votes are an important part of Solanas consensus mechanism to confirm transactions. Besides the appropriate and decentralized transaction fee is the most effective protection measure against spam attacks. With about 3.000 pool. Cardano is a testament to this. Each group. a block producing node. is usually linked to 2-3 relay nodes and is protected behind them. This arrangement prevents network communication directly with the block production node. Relay node acts as a proxy between core and internet network nodes. creating security barriers around the core blocks. A new transaction. after being sent. will be transferred from relay node to node to block. This transaction was then diffused to all other blocks producing nodes. a process also occurred through relay nodes. In contrast to Solana. transactions are not handled immediately. they are kept in memes on multiple network nodes. The next Slot Leader. is the Node that is granted the right to create a new block. access transactions from Mem-Pool and insert them into the new block. you can see a transaction (red box) gradually to all memes (yellow boxes) through the gradual diffusion (red arrow) of the transaction through relay node. I have simplified images to make it easier to understand. At any time. the content of Mem-Pool on all nodes will be different. This is because transactions are sent simultaneously from different locations and the spread of them takes time. each mem-pool contains a single but almost similar transaction collection. Of the 3000 nodes producing blocks. each node has the potential to create a new block that includes a set of equivalent transactions. Node is chosen as the next slot leader will be responsible for creating this new block. You may know that the bot can easily fill the mem-pool of all other nodes in the network through a node. similar to being described in the next image. Through Node 1. all transactions are Node 2 and then Node 3. In the protocol -type protocols like Cardano. each node controls the incoming data speed. the maximum level of simultaneously (the number of tasks simultaneously) and the amount of data has not been processed (the data has been sent but has not been confirmed). This means that each node only requires more work when it is ready. instead of being pushed on it. The Node-to-Node (NTN) protocol transfers transactions between adequate nodes. NTN includes three small protocols (synchronized chain. searching blocks and sending TX). gathered channels on a single TCP channel. NTN follows the strategy based on scissors. in which the node initials the query of new transactions and the node responded to responding by transactions if any. This protocol is perfectly suitable for the environment without trust. in which both sides need to be protected from attacks that consume resources from the other side. Observe the contrast between Cardano and Solana.',\n",
       " ' In the case of Solana. the RPC server authorizes the duty to the authentic person. in Cardanos script. each node will actively protect its resources. Each node is assigned to verify the transaction before transferring it. If a node sends invalid or non -required transactions. it will be disconnected by other nodes. To maintain the same number of connections. it has an option to set up to another node. If the BOT sends valid transactions to a single node. it can saturated the Node mem-pool. When Nodes mem-pool is full. it will stop accepting new transactions (it will not add them to Mem-Pool). Other nodes will only start making transactions if they have empty capacity in their mem-pool. The transactions they obtained can be a combination of transactions created by BOT and user transactions. A node can receive user transactions from its relay node. If a node has enough transactions to fill Mem-Pool. that node will not need to get transactions from other nodes. This is a standard activity for all nodes in the network. If a bot targets a single node. it will not be able to prevent most of the user transactions from being brought into the next blocks. The possibility of successful attacks increases along with the number of nodes targeted by the BOT. as they will fill more memes with valid spam transactions. this significantly complicated and increased the cost of the attack. Each node chooses to refuse transactions. considering them as BOT created. basically protecting other nodes in the network. you can see that BOT sends valid spam transactions to Node 1. Mem-Pool of Node 1 can be filled with valid spam transactions. Alice and Bob send user valid transactions to Node 3. Node 3 has an empty space in Mem-Pool and only get a valid spam transaction from Node 2. When the BOT sends a transaction. it will be added to mem-pool. effectively reserving ADA has been used as a transaction fee. Mem-Pool Cardano has twice the capacity of a block. accommodating about 500 to 600 transactions. If a bot is aimed at creating 100 mem-pool with separate transactions. it will create a total of 60. cost about 6.000 USD. The network can handle this trading volume within an hour. the network may continue to handle a significant amount of user transactions through nodes that the attacker does not target directly and contain user transactions in their mem-pool. some transactions can be taken from other nodes. So they can be valid spam trading. fees and network architecture are the main protection measures against spam transactions. The bot price difference is required to send valid transactions including charges. This is not a traditional DDOS attack. in which the goal is to overwhelm the node with transactions on the network. If the BOT sends a large transaction volume to the network. the nodes may start eliminating the users transactions at the network level. This causes risks for all networks because these are legal transactions including paid fees.',\n",
       " ' If the attacker can make more profits from the price difference. the fee may not provide full protection before spam transactions. The attacker will not run out of money and can maintain the attack as long as the price difference is still profitable. the next important protective layer is network architecture. When discussing decentralization and block production. one can argue that Solana is significantly more focused (and therefore more likely to be overflowed) than Cardano. because the leaders schedule has been defined in advance and all transactions are transferred to them. Note that the number of authentic people is not important at all. The Solana group faces difficult tasks when solving this problem. like the Cardano group. the group must improve the expansion ability. Both challenges are not small.April 2. In a recent interview with Dailycoin. was asked about the attention of governments in capturing Blockchain and decentralized technology. With a happy smile. he asserted: Yes. They have.  He further explained that some US states approached the cardano fund. seeking support in developing a light. transparent and more responsible blockchain voting system. Frederik Gregaard also introduced the theme of the Vote in the UK. although he did not go into specific details. His response is quite detailed. highlighting the wishes of organizations on the assurance of continuity in business. prediction and reliability. In the interview. when Frederik Gregaard stalked that many US states contacted Cardano Foundation for support to build a basic voting system. he considered it a daily affair. He added that what they consider is whether they can provide solutions required in the time frame designated by the other party. From the interview. one can infer that Cardano Foundation is somewhat uncertain about accepting this challenge as if they were having difficulty prioritizing it. Specific details are not public. making it difficult to determine the needs of states in the United States to be difficult and difficult to offer solutions. the successful implementation of the voting system even if only one state of the United States can significantly promote the project. attracting the attention of governments and other organizations are looking for similar solutions. In our point of view. Cardano Foundation should continue to implement the solution if it is feasible in terms of time and quality. These types of projects are exactly what Cardano needs because they match Cardanos mission. Hesitating is not an option. The Cardano community has a long history to participate in the voting process. mainly through the Catalyst voting system. an indispensable part of Cardanos project management and is the main driving force for its decentralized approach that has been operating for a few years. During this period. many of the inherent rounds were completed. each round contributed to the growth and development of the Cardano ecosystem. The Catalysts voting allows the ADA owners to propose. discuss and vote for various projects. thereby directly affecting Cardanos future orientation. This process ensures that the community is still the center of decision making in Cardano.',\n",
       " ' In addition to Catalyst. Cardano Foundation also organized a number of votes. These votes are made with the commitment of the transparency and the participation of the community. These experiences not only provide profound insights for the practicality of blockchain -based voting but also demonstrate the potential of such systems for larger -scale applications. such as voting across the state. It is positive to see that organizations are paying attention to Cardano and know what is happening in its ecosystem. The difference between voting in Catalyst. based on the ownership of ADA token and state voting is very significant. The difference is beyond the number of people voting absolutely so that aspects such as identity verification. Cardano Foundation has no systematic deployment immediately for this purpose. A decentralized identity (DID) will really benefit from the vote of state. Remember that Cardano Foundation is developing Identity wallet will support DID. it has not ended. The development of such a solution and attracting millions of people voting promptly for the next vote in the US is a great challenge and may not be feasible. The cardano fund should be discussed with US states to offer solutions for future voting. The orbit is definitely promising. The use of Blockchain technology for voting can bring more security and reliability than the current post -mail voting system. which is often hindered by fraud and voting many times. Voting with Blockchain can bring some benefits. The voter will be guaranteed that their votes have been calculated accurately. eliminating the possibility of loss of vote. this process can bring advanced anonymous for voting people. Only those who are eligible can vote. The collection of votes will take place on a decentralized infrastructure. not affected or manipulated by any party. The voting results will be available immediately after the end of the voting period. I dare to say that the voting is confidential by blockchain is the future. as it is suitable for gradually digitizing processes as well as security requirements and reliability. No one can predict 5 or 10 years. The attention of American states for this solution is very positive. the community still does not know the detailed information about the person contacting Cardano Foundation and their nature of their discussions. it can be imagined that deep negotiations are being conducted with many entities. It may be more beneficial to focus on successful business projects. such as the pilot project in which Dubai police are testing a cardano -based solution to ensure data integrity. This type of notice attracts attention and helps the cardano application. For governments and organizations. decentralized quality and the application of formal methods in blockchain development can be very important. These factors may even be more important than the transaction speed per second (TPS). as the final solution may be a combination of blockchain and concentrated infrastructure. Frederik emphasized that the search organizations ensure that Blockchain -based solutions are reliable and safe. It is unacceptable for the system to stop working in a day.',\n",
       " ' They require continuity in business. a significant concern in the context of the dispersion system where the infrastructure is not owned by a single entity but instead includes a global volunteer network. this network consists of 3.000 individuals running groups. The Edinburgh decentralized index may become increasingly suitable as organizations seeking to ensure that infrastructure control does not focus on a few entities. It would be interesting to explore whether US states also contacted representatives of other blockchain projects. Although we may never know. it is a possibility. This is why Cardano Foundation should seize the opportunity to be given and try to offer solutions. It will be a pity that Cardano misses this opportunity and instead let another ecosystem benefit. With a dense experience of voting. an existing solution and a team of skilled developers. Cardano ecosystems have a good position to implement such a project. Who else but we should be entrusted with this task?.March 28. The introduction of the Edinburgh decentralized index (Edinburgh (Edin) has aroused the discussions about appropriate methods to accurately quantify decentralized. Justin Bons was one of the first criticism of Edi. saying it was too favored in Cardano in its results. It is necessary to consider the essential features that a protocol should have to enhance its decentralization and whether Justins criticism is worthy. A decentralized decision distribution. This may be related to aspects such as block production. management or diversification of customers. As currently. Edi mainly provides information about block production. this will be the focus of the article. The ultimate goal of decentralized is to prevent a single entity or a corporation of entities that have exclusively influenced the decision -making processes in the network. every participant will have the right to vote equally. like the principle of each person. a vote is applied in political votes. in the field of blockchain. the right to make decisions associated with owning an expensive resource. more resources will have the right to make greater decisions. showing the principle of more resources. more power. a decentralized protocol. unlike a democracy. owns its own properties. Let us consider the characteristics that contribute to enhancing decentralization:. This includes both initial costs and operating costs. It may be involved in buying ASIC exploitation tools and paying regular electricity in case Bitcoin or buying ADA in the case of Cardano. If participants want to create a block. they must operate a complete node and maintain continuous electricity and internet connection (backup conversion solution). Comprehensive comprehensive also requires simplicity. If participants must be subject to high technical requirements. it can hinder the development of decentralized decentralization. decentralized participation needs minimum technical skills. And a lightweight wallet is enough for participants. The fairness indicates that the benefits of the network and the benefits of participants are suitable. Only those who act for the best benefit of the network and other participants & users can enjoy the reward. Everyone will receive a fair reward for the quality of the network. The protocol alone will direct the distribution of rewards.',\n",
       " ' which is not the participation of third parties. The production block must be reliable. In a certain period of time. the maximum number of blocks can be generated in minimum exceptions. this can happen if someone operates a node in an area that is constantly out of power or where the Internet does not need to be trusted. Mass production can be a profitable business in case the project is successful. The interest rate will skyrocket. Personal participants will compete with each other and can try to eliminate competitors. Big players benefit from economic scale. large POW mining companies can receive discounts from ASIC hardware manufacturers or energy suppliers. For decentralized purposes. the advantage of scale must be at least possible. Mechanisms must exist to prevent the formation of cartels (an important issue for the EOS project) and the appearance of whales (more than 50% of Bitcoin blocks are exploited by 2 pools). achieving an ideal solution is not feasible because the wealth is allocated unevenly in society. it is possible to buy decisions in a decentralized network. The only goal that can be achieved is the best possible solution in unfavorable conditions. Pool must consider not only the characteristics that encourage decentralization but also other characteristics. For example: expansion ability. interaction. sustainability. It is difficult to balance all aspects correctly. The result is always the balance between the preferred attributes. I recognize that the peak of decentralization can only be achieved when anyone. even those with minimal resources. can participate and have the opportunity to reap rewards. The input cost to participate in Bitcoin mining is very high. with ASIC exploitation tools costing several thousand dollars. the price of energy varies between countries. making the participation of consensus become monopoly. This led to relatively low network decentralization. while the larger mining companies gradually gained strength. The Ethereum authentication journey requires 32 ETH lock. setting an exclusive input boundary determined by the protocol. People with less than 32 ETH want to participate in the consensus mechanism must use ETH solutions for smaller holders and on behalf of their journey to authenticate. such as CEX and services similar to LIDO. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are related to some forms of resource synthesis. Many participants have to link together to have the opportunity to receive rewards. A single mining may try to exploit BTC but the rate of receiving a very small reward. if 1.000 miners unite. the opportunity to receive their rewards will increase. including more frequent rewards. Bitcoin has pools. while Ethereum has services similar to Lido. The Bitcoin protocol still does not know the existence of the pools. It is simply rewarding the exploitation of blocks without any knowledge of the integrated entity that has been minusced and distributed the work between many exploits. The situation reflects the situation of Ethereum. There are many authentication processes and protocols regardless of who operates them and who owns the ETH key. Lido shows a decentralized weakness. because more than 30% of the total ETH is in a single smart contract.',\n",
       " ' In all existing ecosystems. sooner or later a similar script will certainly appear. Participants who have purchased resources often authorize it to produce blocks. when quantitative decentralization. it is imperative to take into account this. Pool IOG realized that the synthesis of resources is a common and inevitable phenomenon. in order to achieve the highest decentralization. all those who hold the ADA token. regardless of the number. have the opportunity to participate. Cardano directly combined the concept of pool into his protocol. This allows Cardano to be able to stake natural liquidity. eliminating the need for third parties like Ethereum. Without some forms of resource synthesis. all small owners will be banned from participating in the consensus mechanism. this is not a desired result. There are a number of other appropriate reasons why the aggregation of resources brings benefits. Such an advantage is that the production of blocks is guaranteed by IT experts who can easily create solutions to overcome functional incidents and understand security. If the nodes produce blocks are operated by non -experts. POS will often be stolen. this happens a few times at the start of a stake. such incidents are now the past. If all resources owners (for example. only 100 ADA owners) can operate their block production node. the quality of the block production will decrease. Many blocks will be missed. perhaps due to the automatic update process of the operating system will start at the time the node is scheduled to create a new block. Another consideration is that when the number of nodes must achieve a consensus mechanism increases for certain protocols. the complexity also increases. with Ethereum. the number of high authentication is unwanted. This is why 32 ETH limit is necessary and this reduction is not the solution. If the limit is lowered. the number of authentic people will increase. thus increasing the complexity of mutual communication. this is unwanted. The authorization of resources for the Block Producer (Pool) is a favorable. but only when the authorized person maintains the control of resources and may flexibly change their decision as desired. From a security point of view. it will be harmful if the authorized person is forced to give up the control of resources. moving ETH to a trading floor to join Stake is an unfavorable action. There is a risk of ETH that may be stolen by insiders at the exchange or by hackers. Authorization can be divided into two categories: Direct and indirect. Direct authorization. as illustrated by authorizing the ADA to the selected Pool Cardano. allows money to remain in the owners wallet. Owners can still flexibly amend authority at any time. indirect authorization related to the owner loses direct control of resources. making them unable to change the authorization in an important time. such as a cyber attack. These cases include exploitation on the Cloud platform in the context of Bitcoin or CEX Stake ETH in the case of Ethereum. When assessing decentralization. it is important to take into account the number of entities that create blocks.',\n",
       " ' ie entities that operate a full node. resources are used by block manufacturers. whether they are exclusively or authorized. should also be considered. The main factors to consider when quantifying decentralization include:. if the centralized exchange (CEX) Stake ETH on behalf of 100. from the perspective of Ethereum. CEX is the owner of ETH. not an individual who bought ETH. CEX became a single error point and the unit responsible for blocking blocks. Lido is very similar to CEX. but more decentralized. It is important to distinguish between block manufacturers and authorized (Stake) for a number of reasons. Divine manufacturers are active entities to create new blocks in the blockchain. They verify transactions. create new blocks and add them to Blockchain. Their role is very important in maintaining the integrity and function of the network. the authorized or Stake people are participants in their authorization (such as tokens or the hash ratio) for this block manufacturer. Although they may not be actively involved in the production of blocks. their role is equally important. They support the network by providing their resources and in return. they share the rewards created by the block production. The difference between these two roles is essential to understand the motivation of the blockchain network. It helps clarify the allocation of responsibilities and rewards in the network and are the main factors in assessing the decentralization level in the network. The more the production and authorization of the mass are dispersed. the more centralized the network. the miners authorize their calculation power (hash speed) for exploited pools. acting as block manufacturers. This authorization allows miners to have an easier to predict income and allows the network to produce more stable blocks. it should be noted that this also leads to the level of concentration. as the control of the centralized block production in some large mining pools. This is one of many trade -offs in decentralized network design. Stake concept in Cardano is very similar to the Bitcoin exploitation process. the main difference is in terms of. This feature in Cardano promotes a higher decentralized level. Cardano is proud to have a larger number of pools and it is likely that the number of stakes is higher than the number of operators in the Bitcoin network. Of all the other networks that EDI monitored. as well as the networks that have not been put into the EDI. we observe the same motivation. I do not know any network that people hold resources. have the opportunity to create blocks and really do so. Lets go into the motivation between the block manufacturer and the authorized person. using Cardano as an illustration example. In principle. it is very similar to Bitcoin. but there are some significant differences. In Cardano network. pool is a node that produces blocks. The total number of shares of the pool. is the total number of ADA held by the Pool operation and all the Stake (authorized). determining the number of blocks that the pool produces in a certain period of time.',\n",
       " ' You can compare each pool with an independent entity like Lido. Pool is a single node operated (owned) by pool operators. All Stake people support this pool with their ADA and the pool casting blocks on behalf of all the Stake people. Pool operators have a fair action because their reward depends on the total number of shares of the pool. operators based on the ADA token are authorized for them. The owner of ADA may authorize their chosen pools. but ADA never leaves their wallet. They can even eliminate ADA at any time because Cardano has no key term (without penalties and except ADA). This implies that if the pool operates start censors of transactions or cannot cast blocks. the Stake can quickly escape the pool and authorize elsewhere (the effect of authorization will take a few days). who control the production of blocks. can be considered as a level for pool operators to serve the network. Cardano has protective measures to prevent the formation of large pools. The size of the pool is limited by what is called saturated point. When Pool passes the saturated point. the reward for people will decrease. those who hold an economic engine to authorize elsewhere. The network includes multi -pool operators. ie the entities that operate multiple pools. These are often celebrities in the ecosystem and have received the trust of investors. from a decentralized perspective. they are considered whales. The saturation point is like a more psychological barrier. because it is clear that a certain entity operates more pool. a single entity can operate multiple pools by different codes and this fact may not be observed from the outside. pools compete with each other under similar conditions (fees). The entrusting for another pool is relatively simple. Their choice may not only be based on the fee but also based on additional contributions that the operator makes to the community or other priority factors. Justin said: The biggest problem for EDI is that they consider all the pools as single entities. Justin also said: This is obviously a shortcoming approach to decentralization. In the field of Blockchain. the pool acts as a block manufacturer and should be considered individual entities. The authorized person or Stake does not produce blocks but monitors the block production process. such as in the context of the dispersion of dispersion services (DDOS). the large number of nodes created in the network will be beneficial. This makes the network less attacked. This is why Pool Edi researches Shannon Entropy. The more difficult to produce node node is more unpredictable. the more the network becomes safer. A DDOS attack on a lightweight wallet. ie the authorized person. is not feasible. Although a DDOS attack can be carried out in the exploitation machine. it will have a minimum impact on the production of blocks in the Bitcoin network. a DDOS attack on major mining pools like Foundry USA or Antpool can immediately interrupt the quality of block production. If you only count resources.',\n",
       " ' not block manufacturers. then EDI will not tell anything about who is producing blocks. Justin said: A valid figure; It would not be bad if they didnt count all pools as single entities. The alternative here is to identify each person to participate in the pool through chain analysis and other vehicles. A whale with 10 million ADA can operate its pool and will create less blocks than the Pool with 5k Stake people with a total of 50 million ADA. Consider who has direct control of transactions for a block or censorship. It is the operator of the pool. not the authorized person. The decision -making process of a single entity is different from the process of a pool of 5k independent entity collaboration to create blocks. A single entity can decide to start censoring transactions. a 5K entity pool may not agree with this. If an individual in this pool wants to censors transactions. they need to leave the pool. Lets see this from a different angle. From an angle that may start an online attack (for example. a double spending attack). the Node control entity is very important. The representative has no direct control of node. Pool operators can start such an attack regardless of the authorized person. He may hope that the attack will succeed before the representative can realize. It is impossible to confirm that a pool is not a valid entity or it is not counted as a single entity. If Justin confirmed this. it seemed that he was declaring that one of the delegates whether the Node control had censorship of transactions. objective. no authorized person owns this power. I agreed with Justins assertion that the decentralized index of Edinburgh (EDI) lacked data on the number of people holding resources. In Bitcoin network. two Pool Foundry USA and Antpool can conduct an attack. miners have the option to authorize their resources elsewhere. assuming they discovered a timely attack. Large miners can collide. set up their pool and organize an attack through it. it is important to maintain an overview of resource holders. There are whales in every POS network and are good to know about them. Representatives or a small pool of them may agree to attack and thus collaborate with the block producer. This raises the question: Should Nakamoto coefficient be applied for block manufacturers or should set a similar coefficient for authorities? In my opinion. both approaches are valid. Justins criticism seems to stem from misunderstandings about important scenes related to decentralized decentralization (different types of attacks. complexity in communication between nodes. calculations. ) or lack of knowledge about the difference between block manufacturers and authorized people. He may believe that focusing on block manufacturers is meaningless and only the distribution of resources is important. It is essential to recognize the difference in the role of these agents. Even a 5K delegate will not create a single block unless one of them operates a full node to insert transactions into this block and disperse it online.',\n",
       " ' Each of these authorities cannot have nodes producing their blocks. because they will have to agree (consensus mechanism) about whom they will create a block at a certain time. It can be objective that the position of the block producer is stronger than the position of the authorized person. The decentralized index of Edinburgh (EDI) is an open source initiative. receiving contributions from everyone. If there is dissatisfaction with Cardano rated as the most decentralized based on the results. it is important to identify the inaccurous points of objectivity in the methodology. Justin said that considering pools as individual entities is wrong. in my opinion. this argument lacks value.March 26. Cardano is facing a wave of fear. uncertainty and suspicion (abbreviated as Fud) from many different sides. making many people choose to ignore it. There are many cases quoted. Cindesk. owned by Digital Money Group until recently. has continuously maintained negative views for Cardano. The Cardano community has had the same experience with Cointelegraph. K33. an analysis company. has issued a long research report on the sale of ADA. In Messaris annual report sketched out the points for 2024. Solana was mentioned more than 65 times. while Cardano was not mentioned once. may be due to CEO Messaris investment in Solana. Defi Llama has manipulated data. Although the Cardano budget holds the number of ADA in dollars equivalent to the number of ETH held of ETHEREUM Foundation. it is clearly not on the list. Cardano is often overlooked in many statistics. maybe because it can top the category. Crypto Reddit administrator deliberately deleted an article on Edinburgh decentralized index. Tether and Circle have restricted the casting of stablecoins supported by their USD on Cardano. although these stablecoins were present on more than 60 other chains. List of similar examples can continue. Despite these challenges. Cardano continues to grow. largely thanks to its strong community. How does this community manipulate the negative emotions from the influential entities? We will discover this in the article. The quality of a blockchain project may not be reflected in its market capitalization. A common misconception. especially in new participants. is the value assessment of a project with its market capitalization. This can lead to decisions based on short -term price increase. Thinking If the price is increasing. that project is good is popular in the crypto industry. This may be due to many new participants in traditional investment or affected by marketing tactics and influential people are encouraged. During the development of Crypto. there have been many cases of influenced people who are revealed because of receiving bribes to certify projects or disseminate false information. Some people have a public influence to recognize receiving money for advertising activities. while others do not. People with this influence often make spectacular promises. such as a specific project with skyrocketing value or superior technology ownership. Although such behavior is unethical. it is not surprising. Many people who have an influence trying to accumulate influence with the ultimate goal is to be compensated by the project development group.',\n",
       " ' The behavior of Crypto media and ambitious analysis groups reflect this. Reason? The crypto field is mainly motivated by greed. The press. reports from ambitious analysis companies and even analytical tools are often filled with low quality data or fraud. If an individual can affect public opinion. they can also affect the market capitalization of the projects. Although this can be profitable for some people. it often causes many people to be fooled and lost. The biggest damage in this scenario is the crypto industry. A field that is visualized will open a decentralization. transparency and freedom being increasingly being turned into a machine that makes a profit. Individuals are often attracted to the sudden increase in price. It is sure whether the quality of a project that attracts people is a challenge. If the next price increase is guaranteed. or if the opposite - the price manipulation has attracted individuals. leading to further price increase. regardless of the quality of the project. The concept of quality can be vague and subjective. While some individuals prioritize decentralized. others focus on AirDrop or speculate on the development of the NFT chain. Although AirDrop may not improve technology quality. they certainly have a significant impact on market price growth. It is difficult for the blockchain industry to be seriously respected when it is mostly associated with many negative phenomena. Technological. decentralized and renewed advances are overlooked by greed. speculation and suspicious trends being put on top. Each Crypto community is different. There are many paths that lead to success. Some blockchain projects can achieve long -term success. even if the journey achieved that success is related to manipulation and bribes. Technology may not always be the main factor to achieve success. Although this seems unfair. it is an inevitable fact. In an industry where personal profits are often prioritized than the goals that seem distant or challenging. such incidents are not surprising. Despite facing Fud and often overlooked. the Cardano community is still trying to prove the value and value of the project with the world. Go to details of some examples. On the Reddit platform reserved for Crypto. a discussion post on decentralized index Edinburgh was deleted by the censors. they took the reason that the brigade. The accused is a violation of Reddits rules when sharing the posting on platforms such as Telegram or Discord and gathering Blockchain enthusiasts voting for a specific post and leaving positive comments. this seems to make the operator uncomfortable when it is related to Cardano. while the same behavior is often overlooked or even approved publicly in other cases. This can even be observed when groups try to attract people to sell tokens. In response to this. the Cardano community used the community notes. a new tool on the X platform. to overcome comments made by the Reddit censors. Community notes tools have emerged as an effective tool to solve the affirmation of bias. The community has taken advantage of this tool in many different cases.',\n",
       " ' when X cryptodep account released a report on top projects based on social activities. the list includes 10 projects. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to take the top position. this list also includes a number of less known projects such as Azero. Rune and Woo. With Cardanos strong community and its regular trend state on X. it seems that Cardano will not be on the list. The power of the Cardano community is evident in their interaction with comments. This has recently been recognized by Grayscales X account. Grayscale posted a tweet with Bitcoin icon (₿). which caused the Cardano community to respond to the Cardano icon (₳) in their comments. The tweet has attracted 3. 4k likes and 2. 3k comments. most of which include ₳ icon. many comments containing ₳ have received hundreds of likes. This is an impromptu initiative of the community. Anyone who participates in the Cardano community will know that the members of this community are true individuals. something that some people have tried to assert. The power of the Cardano community was clearly shown by 2022 when Vitalik Buterin questioned the Ethereum community about their favorite dominance in 2035. saying that it was not ETH. The poll belonged to Cardano. Of the 600k voting. 250k people chose Cardano. Cardano is proud to have a significant and dedicated supporter community. and it is not too difficult to predict that it can rank among the top three positions. The high level of interaction in the cardano community may be a reaction to Fud and the disregard of the influential entities in the crypto industry. there are cases where even a strong community fails. For unknown reasons. Tether and Circle did not cast the stablecoin supported in their USD on Cardano. which had an adverse impact on the DEFI ecosystem. In response. the Cardano community has shown its ability to recover by sponsoring Mehen USDM through the Catalyst project. USDM has been launched successfully on Cardano main online. showing the ability to resolve the challenges of the community. not all such problems have a positive solution. Cardano constantly won many polls. even if it was not mentioned clearly. If the authors of the poll include the other option. it may be other will win. accompanied by hundreds of comments from the Cardano community. Although some people can consider this a form of troll. it asks how Cardano can assert itself better. In my knowledge. the IOG and Cardano Foundation have never paid for influential people to talk positively about the project. Should I use the ADA of the fund for marketing? It was a kind of decision voted by the community. Some community members are planning to create new independent tools to compete with platforms like DEFI LLAMA. aiming to accurately display Cardano information. this effort will require a significant amount of work and financial resources. It is worth noting that until recently. a type of stablecoin supported in USD was still absent in the ecosystem and the problems of expansion have not been resolved.',\n",
       " ' These are some objective challenges that hinder Cardanos progress. On-chain administration. although it is an important aspect of decentralization. may not be highly appreciated by users. Should the IOG group prioritize the ability to expand (Basho period) rather than administration (Voltaire period)? With 1. 4B ADA in the hands of the community. many initiatives to promote Cardano can be done. The community will set priorities and promote solutions that can expand faster. Perhaps with the increasing participation of the community. some tasks will be solved more simultaneously. this is currently speculated. Cardano is following its own path and its own speed. The FUD processing community effectively. This is probably the most encouraging belief for the community. because a project with a loyal and strong community has no reason to fade.March 21. The 2022 report of Brand Intimacy Agency surprised many Crypto enthusiasts when revealing Cardano as the leading Crypto brand. In the spring of 2024. Cardano continued to maintain its peak position with a constant score. Bitcoin and Polkadot are ranked behind. in turn to ensure the second and third place. we will go into the process of analyzing the relationship between users and the brand because it offers an important scene to interpret the results. we will focus on the results in the crypto category. making detailed reviews about them. Intimacy Agency (also known as MBLM). is a pioneer in the field of brand analysis. Their comprehensive model is designed to create. maintain and measure basic brand relationships. MBLMs brand analysis method is a comprehensive process focusing on some of the main aspects of the brand relationship. The process begins by identifying who the user is. In MBLM research. users are defined as people who have interacted many times with the brand or have used that brand widely. The core of the closeness to the brand lies in the emotional connection between brand and consumers. The more durable the emotional connection. the more close the relationship becomes. This connection is the difference between ordinary users and loyal customers. MBLM has identified six common samples or signs that are always present among brands with close relationships with their users. That is:. The stages of the brand relationship reveal the depth and intensity of the link. They include sharing. linking and consolidating. Each brand is set from 1 to 100. called the level of close level with the brand. This point is based on the popularity (the popularity of the brand for users). the intensity (the level of strong emotional connection) and the characteristics (the nature of the relationship) of the brand relationship. By understanding these aspects. MBLM can analyze and measure the power of the relationship between brand and users. providing deep insights for strategy and brand development. MBLM conducted research in many industries. In addition to Crypto. they include consumer goods. household equipment. communication & entertainment. technology & telecommunications. financial services. fast food. application & social. retail. games and some other fields. The research purpose of MBLM is to achieve a deeper understanding of the market.',\n",
       " ' categories and customers. Their ultimate goal is to establish strong brand relationships to promote performance. level of interaction and profit. Regarding methodology. MBLM. in collaboration with a relative insight and advanced analysis of Allen. has conducted a comprehensive test of more than 600 brands and more than 1. 4 billion words used on selective social media platforms. They use artificial intelligence. analyze text. process natural language and analyze emotional in their research. By focusing on emotional connection between brands and consumers. they can provide valuable insights on brand relationships as well as their impact on performance and level of interaction. The Crypto industry has shown impressive performance in studying close level with the brand of MBLM. In the first year. it was included in the list of one industry. Crypto ranked the eighth impression in the 2022 study. With an average intimate score of 37. Crypto reached a higher score of 36. 8 and superior to the financial service industry. This may be aimed at the fact that the younger generation gradually shifts from the investment in traditional financial services to Crypto. the number of Crypto numbers is 37. So it has improved a bit. Cardano (ADA) topped the list with the number of 52. Despite being a younger and less name token. Cardano has built stronger emotional connections and at the top of the study. Cardanos strongest prototype is passion. Cardano has 21% of users in the sharing stage. 11% in the link stage and 9% in the combination stage. Among consumers writing about Cardano. 1% have close relationships with this brand. Bitcoin (BTC). the most widely held digital assets and transactions. ranked second with a score of 51. According to research. although dominant in the market. this is not the most popular brand. The strongest prototype of Bitcoin is ritual. Bitcoin has 14% of users in the sharing stage. 7% in the link stage and 7% at the consolidated stage. Among consumers writing about Bitcoin. 4% have close relationships with this brand. Another surprise is that the Polkadot (DOT) project occupies the third position with the number of 43. Polkadots strongest prototype is satisfaction. Polkadot has 19% of users in the sharing period. 8% of links and 9% combined. Among consumers writing about Polkadot. Ethereum (ETH) occupies the fourth position with the number of 42. 8 injuries. This is a surprise because Ethereum is the largest smart contract platform with the second largest market capitalization in the Crypto industry. The strongest prototype of Ethereum is satisfaction. Ethereum has 13% of users in the sharing stage. 7% in the link stage and 4% at the consolidated stage. Among consumers who write about Ethereum. 9% have close relationships with this brand. The table below shows the results of four Crypto projects discussed. Cardanos dominant prototype has shifted from satisfaction (2022) to passion (2024). This prototype revolves around pampering and satisfied. It suggests that users receive joy and satisfaction when interacting with Cardano. This change may be thought to be due to the reliability of the network.',\n",
       " ' including Stake and the development of the DEFI ecosystem. Two years ago. the cardano community was expected and wanted to find out if the project could meet their promises. users can actively use many DEFI applications on Cardano and directly evaluate their quality. Cardano leads in all stages of sharing. cohesion and consolidation. Cardano has 9% of consolidated users. the highest brand closeness. compared to Bitcoins 7%. This shows that Cardano users have a deep. deep relationship with the brand and they consider themselves and the brand as one. This is a significant achievement for a younger brand like Cardano. Although Bitcoin works better on advanced prototypes. rituals and nostalgia. it falls behind Cardano in the stages of sharing. This shows that although Bitcoin has been deeply ingrained in the users daily life and habits. it may not have a deep emotional relationship like Cardano with users. It should also be noted that the keywords related to Bitcoin are buy and sell. This implies that users mainly see Bitcoin as an investment tool. Although Bitcoin is an older project with a larger market capitalization. Cardanos higher level of intimacy may be due to its strong performance in the prototype of passion. This shows that Cardano can bring user experience more satisfied and satisfied than Bitcoin. The results of MBLM from 2022 to 2024 showed a remarkable consistency. This consistency can be attributed to a number of factors. MBLM uses a proven method of developed over a decade of qualitative and quantitative research. Consumer behavior for brands tends to gradually change over time. unless there is a significant market decline or changes in the brands strategy. the brands intimate score may be relatively stable from year to year. Brands always meet or exceed the expectations of consumers. suitable for their value and successfully interact with them at different stages of the relationship (sharing. cohesion and harmony) that can maintain their intimate score. Crypto enthusiasts often equate the best brand with the brand with the fastest market capitalization. Stake on the development of the project is not necessarily promoting the positive connection between users and brands. In the long term. Cardano maintaining the leading position in the brand rankings is beneficial. This achievement sooner or later may be reflected in its market capitalization. Cardano is considered a project not only for enrichment for speculators. Tasks and stories surrounding Cardano have a deeper meaning than just speculating. This perception is confirmed by MBLM results. Experts have recognized Cardano as the most decentralized Blockchain under the EDI discussion session. while Bitcoin and Ethereum dropped behind in this field. Reasonable is the result of MBLM that reflects to some extent the quality of decentralization between other factors. The Cardano community is famous for constantly leading in the polls conducted on many different social media platforms. especially on the X platform. This phenomenon is most likely related to the observed results in MBLM research. The Cardano Community celebrated Mehens USDM. Stablecoin pioneering supported by USD on Cardano.',\n",
       " ' was successfully launched on March 16. Although the first launch was planned on December 19. the Mehen group had to postpone. the second was successful. USDM is the first Stablecoin that we know without any competent authorities that can freeze accounts or censorship transactions. Mehen USDM is a stablecoin supported by legal money. meaning it is supported by the US dollar in a ratio of 1: 1. Each USDM token is supported with 1: 1 in USD. ensuring its stability and reliability. The initial USDM is available in 17 states of the United States. The process of casting and burning is as follows. Users in the legal areas are eligible to connect their cardano wallet with Mehen Dapps. complete the identity verification (KYC) and link bank accounts. The USDM casting can only be done if the USD is sent to an associated bank account. With every USD sent. a USDM token will be cast. This ensures that every USDM token is supported by 1: 1 in USD in a US -based bank. When users have USDM token in their blockchain address. they can send them to another address or use them in the DEFI application. Users who have been verified KYC can exchange USDM 1: 1 for USD. then this amount will be sent to an associated bank account. The corresponding USDM token will be burned to maintain a fixed level of 1: 1. Although the USDM casting does not have a fee. the US dollar exchange for USDM will pay 1. 5%. with a minimum fee of 50 USD and a maximum of $ 5. Mehen USDM is verified by the 3rd party Oracle Charli3 service. ensuring that all casting and burning activities are authenticated. Charli3 is a famous Oracle service in Cardano ecosystem. allowing smart contracts to interact safe with off-chain data. Charli3 has API access to bank accounts to verify all casting and burning tokens. Charli3 is tasked with verifying the banks reserve balance before each USDM casting activity and distributing this information publicly on-chain. This unique approach to verify the reserve to ensure that the value of each USDM token is always supported by Fiat reserves in the real world. Mehen is a registered monetary service enterprise with the financial crime enforcement network (Fincen). ensuring that the operation of the business meets the highest standards of financial integrity. This is also a digital asset enterprise registered in the Virgin Islands. complying with strict financial regulations of the region. Mehen is actively looking for suitable licenses in the United States and the Cayman Islands. This pursuit emphasizes Mehens dedication to protecting customers interests and ensuring the status of USDM token as a means of value storage can be changed. not securities. In terms of user verification. anyone can hold. transfer or use USDM without going through procedures to know your customer (KYC). users who want to cast new USDM with legal money or exchange USDM for legal money will have to go through a simple KYC process.',\n",
       " ' consistent with the global standards. Mehen conducts actual ID inspections. verification of activities. fraudulent inspections. and sanctioned individual/organizations. Mehen supports the creation of authentic information approved by KYC (KYC-APPRVED) by collaborating with platforms such as Atala Prism. IAMX. ADA Handle and other non-central/autonomous ID standards are being developed. Minswap and Genius Yield Dex are the official launch partner of USDM. Mehens policy ID: C48CBBB3D5E57Ed56E2E276BC45F99AB39ABE99E6CD7AC39FB402DA47AD. In the field of USD token (creating stablecoin supported in USD). there are two outstanding projects: USDT and USDC. Both projects have achieved significant success. ensuring the position in the top 10 according to market capitalization. USDT and USDC are present everywhere on large networks. These stablecoins can be found on Ethereum. Algorand. Tron. Stellar and Hedera Hashgraph. along with others. The publishers of these stablecoins. Tether for USDT and Circle for USDC. can freeze accounts and censors transactions on many different blockchains. This action is usually taken to respond to law enforcement requirements or to minimize suspicious activities. Both Tether and Circle have the right to freeze accounts related to illegal activities or violations of their terms of use. Above all the platforms mentioned above. can freeze the account holding these stablecoin or put specific addresses on the black list. According to the design. Cardanos original property does not allow freezing accounts or transactions. This feature makes USDM. a unique stablecoin in the crypto industry. not confiscated or limited spending due to any organization imposed. Cardano handled the identical token with ADA in terms of transfer and ownership. The protocol does not require smart contracts to facilitate token transfer. the token is an unpaid output (UTXO) that is stored directly in the ledger. Put simply. combining codes into smart contracts will limit Stablecoin holder is not feasible because the transfer of tokens does not use smart contracts. the Mehen group uses a set of instructions to facilitate the casting and burning USDM token. The Cardano community often argues about the feasibility of USDC and USDT storage on their online. The argument revolves around the needs of the issuing organization must comply with the prescribed requirements. often requiring the ability to freeze accounts and censorship transaction. Mehens USDM has proven that it can really launch a stablecoin supported by legal money on Cardano. where users can trust that the publisher will not hinder their spending or impose other limitations. According to my best understanding. no stablecoin is supported by other USD in the crypto industry to comply with decentralized principles and strict ownership like Mehens USDM. A common question is the potential impact of the USD frozen authorities in a bank account. The key to the problem lies in the replacement ability of the Fiat currency. In the context of Cardano. there is no direct link between USD in a bank account and specific blockchain address and USDM. Although theoretically. authorities have the right to freeze money in the bank account. this action does not affect on-chain activities. US holders will not encounter any limitations of their USDM spending ability.',\n",
       " ' such an event can lead to a discount scenario. You can track USDM casting in Cexplorer. The Mehen project is funded by Catalyst Fund10. The group requested 800. The community voted to support the project. The Mehen project acts as a testament to the importance of Catalyst as a financial support mechanism for community projects in Cardano ecosystem. Successfully introducing a stablecoin type supported in USD. sponsored by ADA from the Cardano budget. is a remarkable achievement. The Cardano community now has access to a Stablecoin Fiat and no longer depends on the decision of Tether or Circle in castting and USDC on Cardano. The Mehen project is formed with a specific purpose of bringing Stablecoin supported by USD to Cardano. a goal they have accomplished. Mehens USDM is proud to have unique attributes against USDT and USDC. leading to speculation that the group may consider expanding to other platforms. this is still conjecture at this time because the group has not officially mentioned this possibility. as Stablecoin. is supported by the first legal amount available on Cardano. which has the advantage of being the leader. Even with the ability to introduce USDT and USDC for Cardano. it is likely that USDM will still be the favorite choice of the community. supported by the Catalyst Fund. The efforts of the Mehen team also deserve loyalty and support. the community is making efforts to allow Token Cardano to have similarities with ERC-20 standards. This will allow the transfer of tokens to be controlled through smart contracts. The pursuit of the prestigious stablecoin to Cardano is still meaningful. The increase in diversity leads to increasing security for users. if these Stablecoin imposed limitations to the users spending rights. like other platforms. users may be loyal to USDM. If you are looking for a stablecoin that is supported in USD in the crypto industry without being affected by limited spending restrictions imposed by a third party. the USDM on Cardano is the right choice for you.March 19. IAGON is a project to revolutionize web and cloud services. It is a platform to exploit the storage capacity and the processing power of many computers in a decentralized network. The purpose of IAGON is to provide companies and individuals to store and handle later with the price equal to a part of the market price. it wants to provide higher levels of security. By combining unused storage in servers and personal computers as well as their processing power. IAGON aims to create a supercomputer and data centers that can compete with current Cloud computing tycoons such as AWS. Google Cloud. Microsoft and IBM. IAGON can compete with famous Cloud services through a decentralized model and a unique approach for storage and processing. Advantages of IAGON compared to traditional services:. Although decentralized is an important aspect of IAGONs model. this is one of the many advantages that allows it to compete with reputable Cloud services. It is the combination of these factors that makes IAgon an attractive alternative in the Cloud service market.',\n",
       " ' The IAGON protocol related to storage providers providing their resources. consumers of resources using these resources and the market are supported by the IAGON protocol where these transactions take place. The protocol ensures that all transactions are safe. transparent and beneficial to all parties involved. Describe the parties related to the IAGON protocol:. Archive supplier is the supplier of storage resources for the IAGON network. Any device that meets the minimum requirements can become a memory supplier. allowing users to earn rewards when providing memory. Consumer resources are users using storage resources provided by the storage service provider. They pay for the storage capacity they use and the payment will be transferred to the storage supplier. The market is the foundation where suppliers and interactive resources consumers. The market allows storage service providers to earn rewards by trading their excess storage to consumers resources at a transparent price. The IAGON protocol is a basic technology that facilitates the interaction between the storage supplier and the resource consumers. The protocol ensures privacy. security and data access. It also processes the distribution of rewards to storage service providers. IAGON has a detailed roadmap for the period of 2023-2025. including some important milestones. I believe that the roadmap is not updated. IAGON is proud to have hundreds of nodes operating in dozens of countries. You can also participate. Web3 represents the next generation of the Internet. where decentralized applications (DApps) operate online in peer instead of relying on a single agency. IAGON. with a decentralized cloud computing and storage platform. completely suitable for this vision. IAGON provides a centralized Cloud storage set for DAPPS and NFT storage on the network without trust and does not need to be allowed. This is consistent with the decentralized and controlled user control of web3 and DEFI. IAGON allows users to have full control of their data. Users decide what they share and who can see it. The American Securities and Securities Commission (SEC) has turned the green light for Bitcoin ETF. attracting growing attention from investors who want to take advantage of the growing blockchain economy. These investors are looking for stable profits with the as little risk possible. Stake the tokens Proof-of-Stake (POS) has become an attractive option and its popularity is increasing. In Europe. Cardano ETP has received approval. allowing investors to participate in Stake Ada. The Liqwid Finance protocol is based in Switzerland. cooperating with Isuance. swiss AG. launched ETP. This ETP. called CaSL. not only records the performance of ADA but also the interest earned when Stake Ada. CASL stands for Cardano Stake Etp. It is the stock code icon that Cardano Stake Etp traded on Six Swiss Exchange. The Stake Ada of ETP is done by Liqwid. ETP is 100% supported by ADA held in a cold wallet (offline). Although the specific schedule for distributing Stake rewards for CaSl ETP is not detailed in available sources. it should be noted that investors may predict their double investment income. Because the Cardano protocol allocates Stake rewards every 5 days.',\n",
       " ' it is reasonable to expect that these rewards will be added to the investors balance. Cardano protocol automatically stake all ada is kept in the wallet. CaSl etp can access all types of investors. This includes organizational and retail investors. It is designed to become a quality product. liquidity. low cost. Six Swiss Exchange. based in Zurich. is the main Swiss stock exchange. This is the leading market for stocks. bonds. ETF. ETP. mutual fund and structured products of Switzerland. It provides a world -class platform produced by Switzerland for investors. releases and intermediaries. CaSl etp opened the Stake gate for investors. For both retail and organizational investors. adventure entering the field of crypto and stake may be a difficult task. The complexity of the acquisition. safe storage and digital property stake. along with the fear of self -management. may be scary. this context can be a great effort for these investors. Although CaSl ETP can focus on the network. it can enhance security by increasing the market price of ADA. Creating so many such products or adding more Pool Stake (SPO) is more independent for Liqwid Finance will benefit. People often ask the difference between ETP and ETF. Please say this. Exchange transaction products (ETP) are a large portfolio of investment vehicles monitoring indicators. goods or basic financial instruments. They include many different types of investments. including funds and goods. and traded on exchanges such as stocks. the exchange fund (ETF) is a specific type of ETP. They track a basket of basic stocks and often reflect the performance of indicators. branches or goods prices. ETF provides transparency and efficiency to invest in the entire market or specific economic corners without having to buy basic assets. the legal environment has specific requirements for ETF. ETF is usually built based on collective investment plan. mainly UCITS. This means that they must comply with certain regulations and limitations may not be applied to other ETP types. CaSL products are ETP. not ETF because it is built based on a unique concept: it not only tracks the performance of ADA but also the interest earned when stake money. This is a different feature that does not match the traditional ETF structure. CaSl ETP is designed so that all investors can access. The choice of CaSL is ETP instead of ETF may be due to the unique structure of the product and the legal environment in Europe. The organizations demand for POS money stake is increasing significantly. POS has become one of the most popular consensus mechanisms not only because of the efficiency of using energy but also because it has created a new opportunity for investors to organize passive income search through Stake. Stake organized Crypto to indicate the participation of major investors - the Protection Fund and Finance Funds into the Stake Mechanism of Blockchain POS. Organizations deploy important assets to enhance network security to earn rewards and even affect governance (this may not be always desired and will be the topic of debate).',\n",
       " ' After Ethereum converts from POW to POS. Stake POS demand is increasing. Institutional Stake has emerged as an attractive path for financial growth and participating in the Blockchain ecosystem for different parties. There are similar ETPs for both Ethereum and Solana. For example: 21Shares Ethereum Stake ETP (Aeth) and 21shares Solana Stake ETP (ASOL). Both ETP monitors the performance of ETH and SOL respectively and brings Stake profits to re -invested in ETP to improve performance. Introducing CaSl ETP for Cardano to pave the way for investors to access opportunities similar to Ethereum and Solana. Grayscale has introduced the Grayscale dynamic income fund (GDIF). a unique product combining ripe POS blockchain. with a significant part of the less known POS blockchain. GDIF works by selling Stake rewards every week to create USD. These USD rewards will then be distributed to quarterly customers. GDIF did not re -invest in Stake rewards to increase the amount of Crypto holding. so the Stake Bonus did not increase. The main goal of GDIF is to maximize USD profits in a short time frame. especially in the price market. it is worth noting that GDIFs performance can slow down in the price market. leading to the ability to reduce interest rates. It is predicted that CaSl ETP will accumulate Stake rewards. thus increasing the level of investors contact with ADA and then increasing their Stake reward. This strategy allows Stake investors in the price market and gain benefits from Stake rewards in the price market. which can be a smarter approach to Stake. it should be noted that institutional behavior is unpredictable due to lack of historical precedent. The growing interest of the organization for POS money stake indicates the desire to participate in the increasing blockchain revolution. this significant investment can also cause concerns because wealth is often associated with pursuing influence. Large -scale ADA investors can become influential people in Cardano administration. The future will reveal how this motivation takes place.March 12. Crypto brings new financial prospects established for use by both individual and organizational investors. The Stake process plays an important role in blockchain decentralization and security. with protocols that encourage participants through the distribution of new money. This promise of this guaranteed profit attracts all players on the market. Grayscale has launched Grayscale dynamic income fund (GDIF). including nine blockchain Proof-of-Stake. It is worth the reflection on the blockchain selected by Grayscale and the meaning of this in the field of crypto. we will consider GDIFs goals and discover why it mainly refers to the less known projects. Digital currency pool. Foundry USA. the largest Bitcoin pool and Grayscale owns. has played an important role in professionalizing Bitcoin mining activities. This field has witnessed the growing dominance of large corporations. usually multinational. The process of earning rewards from Bitcoin protocol has been shown to be a profitable business. Organizations are currently realizing the opportunity in parallel in Stake. Grayscale introduced Grayscale dynamic income fund (GDIF). combining ripe blockchain Proof-of-Stake. The main goal of the fund is to distribute rewards in the US dollar quarterly.',\n",
       " ' We may soon see the appearance of other Stake funds similar to GDIF. This is an appropriate question to consider the impact of organizational investment on blockchain (POS). although it can reduce decline by leading to the appearance of new entities that own a significant amount of money. it can also enhance security by making a 51% attack more expensive. Token holders may welcome this. because the organizations investment can promote the market price of POS money. this comes with its own risks. Organizations have the right to increase coin prices through buying. but they can also make prices drop sharply if they lose interest in a specific project. But is there any persuasive reason to pause Stake? We will study more about this topic later. The operation of the Stake Fund is that investors commit their capital. The capital then is invested by Grayscale in a variety of pop tokens. It should be noted that not all selected blockchains use POS consensus mechanism. As long as they offer some forms of rewards. Grayscale Stake these tokens and earn rewards in the new form of tokens. These stake rewards are sold weekly to create USD. Grayscale then pays its customers with a quarterly dollar reward. Grayscale protects its customers from the complexity associated with Stake. including the right to manage property. Investors are only required to provide capital and in return they receive regular rewards from the POS category managed by Grayscale. Of the top 10 blockchains. Grayscale only chose two for their Stake Fund. namely Ethereum (Coinbase Staked CBeth) and Solana (SOL). This fund also includes other projects such as APTOS (APT). Celestia (Tia). Cosmos (ATOM). Near (Near). Osmosis (OSMO). Polkadot (DOT) and Sei Network (SEI). Not putting ADA into the Grayscale fund surprised the Cardano community. possibly due to the relatively low stake capacity of about 3%. When checking the current reward ratio on the Steakerewards gate. it is found that among the projects brought into the fund. Ethereum has the lowest capacity at 3. 73%. Sei followed closely with the rate of 4. 41%. All other selected projects have a yield exceeding 7%. of which Cosmos and Celestika bring the highest stake reward. bringing over 16%profit. in the top 10. is not included in the fund. may be due to low capacity similar to Cardano. famous projects Avalanche and Algorand. although they have higher yields than Ethereum. are not included in the fund. The information suggested that the main goal of the fund is to maximize the Stake reward in the shortest time frame that can be less considerable to other specific data or details of the project. 58% significantly the portfolio only includes three projects. Osmo accounts for the largest market share with a rate of 16. 52%. Sol ranked second with a capacity of 7. followed by Polkadot with a yield of 10. 76%. All other projects. is proud to have the highest market capitalization among the POS blockchain. are in the other category. profit is a factor that has more influence on the formulation of a portfolio compared to other aspects such as market capitalization.',\n",
       " ' acceptance rate. total locked value (TVL). user. We estimate that Ethereum may have only about 5% in the portfolio. It is clear that the Stake Grayscale Fund is not necessarily designed to give the highest quality projects with great success in their portfolio. It seems that the main purpose of GDIF is to extract value. namely a reward stake. thereby making a profit for investors. From a life perspective. this approach enhances security but has to pay for decentralization. It will not be built when looking at the fund from the perspective of the POS blockchain. which is not included in the portfolio or has a minimum representative level. is less or less potential. It can be said that fund managers are realized that the need to play an important role in pricing tokens. The demand for tokens from the top 10 projects will certainly exceed the demand for relatively strange projects that their only advantage is high stake bonus. The Stake Fund can contribute to the market price growth of these blockchain tokens. which can attract new retail investors. only this may not guarantee the success of the platform in the application of DEFI. the user facility. the total locked value (TVL). Another important aspect to consider is the monetary policy of these projects. Projects that provide high stake rewards often apply infinite tokens policy. This implies that the scarcity of tokens. especially in the future. will be lower than projects like Cardano. where the supply is limited to 45 billion ADA. Solana is a crypto with inflation without a hard limit for the total number of tokens. It has an initial annual inflation rate of 8%. this rate will decrease by 15%per year until 1. this will be a fixed long -term rate. Polkadot has inflation. with annual fixed inflation of 10% and does not have the maximum supply. It is important to understand the origin of high stake profits of projects that have been included in GDIF. Typically. this is the result of inflation that never ends with a high initial ratio. a strategy that many emerging stake funds can apply. Imagine launching a new Blockchain POS with low market capitalization and high stake rewards. about 20%. By selling a significant part of the coins to funds with a significant discount. you can evoke their interest. This can ensure that the blockchain will be included in the Stake fund. This strategy has an incredible similarity with Airdrop. although more complex. It is basically a means to attract attention. this system sooner or later will definitely fall into an economic deadlock. If inflation is too high. the market price of token will decrease to the point where it is no longer attractive even though the stake reward is high. If inflation decreases over time. as the case of Solana. it will eventually lose the appeal to the money stake. tokens can be concerned by a different focus fund. GDIF is only for investors with a minimum of US $ 1.',\n",
       " ' 1 million. Consider a scenario in which an investor buys 1 million coins from a certain blockchain POS for $ 1 million. With a 20%stake yield. investors can make an annual profit of 200. an impressive number. this depends on the project to maintain the market price of tokens for a long time. even in the market price. this is unlikely. If the value of tokens drops to $ 0. investors not only suffer from 80% losses. but the stakes income also decreases. The income will then be 40 thousand USD. equivalent to an annual profit of only 4% of the investment. In order for Stake to still attract investors in the long run. they must suit the needs of tokens. in a market price down. keeping money and waiting for the market to increase the next price can bring more profits. But that means there is no frequent low USD reward in the market price. An organization may stop stake money and withdraw from a specific project under low capacity conditions. Low yields often reflect the decrease in token needs. If a significant part of the community and users lose confidence in the project. the value of tokens may decrease. what GDIF seems to miss is the potential for long -term market capitalization of the projects. This fund may only work well in the market price upcoming. it may not attract much attention. because it may not be worth the significant decline in the value of the portfolio because the US dollar prizes are relatively low. The approach of funds will reflect the approach of BTC mining companies. They should only sell the minimum amount of money needed to cover costs in the market price and wait for a price market. where the sale will be more beneficial. Long -term holders have gained the greatest benefits from BTC and the same principle will be true for POS platforms. Those who accurately assess the potential of the project will gain the most benefit from Stake. Their profits will not only come from the market capitalization of the project but also from the cash flow created by the POS projects. According to the decentralized index of Edinburgh (EDI). Cardano is ranked as the most decentralized blockchain of the top 10 blockchain. It provides safe stake ability without third party. unlike Ethereum. Cardano is proud to have a vast and dedicated community with about 1. 4 million Stake people. Despite these attributes. Grayscale doesnt seem to be interested. maybe because Stakes yield is only 3%. Cardanos Stake reward is about half of their potential value. due to the higher saturation of Pool than the K parameter. currently placed at 500. The most ideal is to have 500 complete saturated pools. It is not sure whether Grayscales portfolio managers will fully understand the monetary policies of blockchain projects. They seem to support higher token inflation than the scarcity of tokens and seem to prioritize short -term profits than long -term benefits from technological progress.',\n",
       " ' We believe that long -term holders who have bought tokens at low cost and accumulate Stake rewards in one (or some) market prices will eventually sell when the price of tokens market is more than a significant purchase value that the accepting people who have purchased them soon. They can start selling only regular stake rewards and holds most of the money. It will be a passive source of income for them. The scarcity of Token ADA strengthens this view. Although it is possible to constantly create new blockchains with high tokens inflation. this method may soon lose momentum. The market price of a token will always reflect the success of its protocol. We think Cardano will eventually find his position in the Stake fund category.March 8. We consider AXO as an important innovation among blockchain projects in the field of trading. we will go deep into the nature of programmable swap transactions. which is the foundation of AXO. Cardanos smart contract. including on-chain authentication and off-chain code. provides strong security. Off-chain turing-complete allows for complexity and multi-resource-consuming calculations without affecting transaction costs. The on-chain authentication provides the level of security equivalent to other blockchain models. This innovation is breakthrough because it allows the implementation of concepts like programmable swap and automatic market makers (AAMM). things that otherwise it will not be feasible. The AXO group has effectively exploited the capabilities of the UTXO model and the design of the smart contract platform. allowing the complicated logical execution of all the programs that can be programmed in off-chain segments according to their specifications and on-chain status. Despite the off-chain commanding tool. the protocol is still safe as if fully executed on-chain thanks to the on-chain authentication. it is possible to meet decentralized needs and peer -to -peer online communication while building a modern financial application that can be expanded. Consider the programmable swap as the most brief expression of the traders intention. shown in the NFT created with an on-chain state. The programmable swap consists of four factors:. The type of SWAP priority transmission command. such as immediately exchanging assets (market orders) or swap at a set price (limited order). The activation process set conditions to activate the exchange. Market orders. no need to activate. will operate immediately. leading to immediately asset swap. The limit command has a price activation level. It still does not work until the market price matches the price set. activate the swap and activate the action. Execute SWAPs operation outline when activated. leading to a transaction. Property is the subject of the proposed execution action. Images illustrating the programmable SWAP of the limited command type. The trader sets the Hosky exchange conditions for ADA when the Hosky price is equal to or higher than the ADA price. The SWAP intended to involve 10000 hosky. In the AXO protocol. there are many SWAP transactions that can be programmed high fragmented from many traders. SWAP transactions are matched by the matching tool and are executed. The programmable swap allows to execute many types of commands subtly.',\n",
       " ' Another example may be the average cost of dollars (DCA). providing flexible liquidity. portfolio management strategy. The creation of SWAP transactions can be programmed to be associated with the NFT casting process. which occurs during the commitment stage. The programmable swap transactions are sent to Blockchain through casting NFT. packing all the data needed to perform SWAP. The parallel ability of NFT casting is a major advantage. After a programmable swap transaction is recorded in the ledger. it will turn to the commitment phase. SWAP transactions can be done together. The programmable swap transactions are placed in the execution team from which they can be selected and used. To perform SWAP. it takes at least two blocks. The original block was used for the commitment phase. in which the new NFT. representing the new SWAP intention. was created. The SWAP can only take place in the next block after the programmable swap is recorded in the blockchain. With each additional block. the new programmable SWAP transactions can be sent. but the SWAP transactions have committed to also executed. The execution team is divided into two parts: Active Frontier (operating limit) and Inactive Frontier. Active Frontier contains SWAP transactions that can be scheduled and can be executed in the current block because all conditions due to the determined activation process are met. the unlimited operating limit containing SWAP transactions cannot be implemented because not all activation conditions are met. Images illustrating the interaction of the AXO protocol with Cardano block. Swap transactions can be programmed to be sent in the block. From AXOs point of view. this occurs during the commitment phase. meaning that SWAP transactions 5. 6 and 7 can only be executed in the next block. SWAP 1 and 2. located in Active Frontier. is currently participating in SWAP property. SWAP 3 and 4. within the unlimited limit. wait for all the prerequisite conditions to activate to switch to the operation limit. See what happens to programmable swaps between two blocks. The implementation of the SWAP includes joints that can be programmed from Active Frontier in N block and transacting for N+1. Many programmable swap transactions are used as inputs. which can not only create a transaction but also can create a new programmable output that can contain unused assets. As described in the next image. a new SWAP 8 appears from SWAP 1 and 2. acting as a new transaction input (expressed in red arrow). All SWAP transactions can be programmed from the commitment phase in the process of converting N block to operating limits or inactive (indicated by green arrow). SWAP 5 and 6 switches to the operating limit (they can be scheduled). while the SWAP 7 is still at unlimited operating. SWAP 3 has shifted from unlimited operating in block N to limit operating in block N+1 (marked with purple arrow). SWAP 4 is still in the Inactive Frontier (marked with blue arrow). New SWAP transactions 9 and 10 have been sent in new N+1 blocks.',\n",
       " ' These processes repeat in each block with a larger number of programming swap. Under certain market conditions. SWAP transactions may occur within the operating limit that is transferred to unlimited operating. Every exchange can finally reach the end of the life cycle (EOL). indicating that it can be removed because it is no longer needed. There are two situations that lead to the destruction of programmable swap transactions. One is to send cancellation command as another programmable swap. which will destroy the existing programming swap. The rest is that when exchanging. it can be programmed to reach its EOL. It means the intended actions have been completed or have expired. The image below illustrates the various activities in the AxO protocol. Execution tool. an off-chain component of AxO. processing cancellation commands (preventing them in SWAP transactions). making swap transactions and updating operating limits and inactive (moving SWAP transactions that can be programmed based on market volatility). The AXO protocol stands out in handling programmable swap transactions. Its command matching tool can connect the programmable swap transactions of various types of commands. such as market orders with limited commands. Suppose a committed M market command is committed. This command can be executed as long as it has liquidity. at the most favorable price. Suppose this price is offered by the L limited order and the property is sold sufficiently to fully meet the M market order. the transaction is sent. using both M and L as the input eutxo. Transactions include assets that SWAP that intermediaries have sent Market M for spending. so the property is transferred directly to the intermediate wallet. A newly created UTXO. retaining the remaining assets that have not been used up according to market orders. thus creating a new programmable swap transaction - a new limit command. The image below illustrates the transaction implementation of SWAP. The transaction input includes M market command from intermediaries 1 and L limited command L. Transfer of property to the address of intermediaries 1 and sending a new limit L . retaining the remaining assets is not used in SWAP. Observing that market requirements have been met by using liquidity from the limited command. a shown approach proven to be highly effective in the context of liquidity. The creation of NFT in the commitment phase is ideal structure for parallel processing. This allows to create SWAP transactions that can be programmed in each block cycle. eliminating delays and sequences. The stage of commitment to optimize simultaneously and pave the way for high pine. The implementation of the SWAP transactions can require a minimum amount of information. resulting in reducing costs and memory use levels. Cardanos architecture allows developers to integrate basic functions in the applications on-chain section. while complex functions. including trading preparation. off-chain processing. The on-chain authentication is only verified that UTXO spending conditions have been met. Off-chain function translates transactions. then is authenticated on-chain using authentication instructions. These instructions can confirm the necessary status conversion process. The complex logic of the AXO protocol.',\n",
       " ' including the matching tool and the executable tool for programmable swap transactions. is in the off-chain section of the application. It should be noted that the automatic execution process and the algorithm are supported by the programmable SWAP transactions that are done completely on-chain. This implies that there is no connection to external APIs. no external software has access to the contract and no essential ingredients are stored off-chain. In Cardanos programming model. the off-chain ingredient is responsible for selecting Eutxo for the transaction. the actual implementation still takes place on-chain. This shows that the model provided by the AXO protocol is not only closed but more importantly it does not need to be trusted and deployed by using smart contracts. this design brings efficiency equivalent to modern centralized exchanges. while maintaining decentralized characteristics and self -management of property. The AXO protocol operates with SWAP transactions that can be programmed to be highly fragmented. They are paired in the off-chain section of the application. only requires the minimum information stored in each can programmable SWAP. When the AXO protocol can take advantage of Hydra Head to perform programmable swap transactions to expand the size of transactions. the impact of fragmented. simple and wonderful design will become clear. All EUTXO in the operating limit can be transferred to Hydra Head to execute and after being executed will return to the first class to resolve transactions. Because every time the SWAP can program the smallest possible purpose. it ensures the most effective exchange of information between classes. A different feature of the programmable SWAP transactions is their ability to compose. The combination of this programmable SWAP transactions implies that they can be consolidated. undergoing testing process and thus creating new and unique programming swap transactions. The ability to combine is a basic aspect of the functional programming and composition of the programs that can be programmed to show the most functional approach to financial contracts. The programmable swap is a closed financial contract. without trust and is done completely on-chain. It was an autonomous unit of On-Chain code. This allows automatic transactions and algorithms. with complex logic processed off-chain. Its easy to transfer SWAP transactions to other layers and vice versa. These SWAP transactions are unique because they can be combined. undergoing type testing and creating unique new programming swap transactions. The design of the SWAP transactions can be programmed to help divide the liquidity. helping the first-class market to organize for the first time to operate on-chain. This is highly effective. comparable to centralized exchanges. while maintaining decentralization and self -management of property. SWAP transactions can be programmed to be an important component in the context of decentralized financial. increasing the efficiency and security of the capital market.March 4. A group of dedicated researchers from the University of Edinburgh has developed an extrinburgh decentralized index (EDI). a pioneer tool designed to provide profound real -time insights of large blockchain projects. the group has announced the first results in their work to the public.',\n",
       " ' The interactive Edi index table has been launched. giving users a detailed view of decentralized data of some leading blockchain projects. Cardano and other projects. These initial findings are especially focused on the decentralization of the consensus mechanism. one of the important aspects of Blockchain technology. Although the researchers have provided profoundly valuable insights. it is important to note that this is the first step. we will consider the results and explain how to interpret them. EDI is a significant step forward to bring transparency and objectivity to the field of Blockchain. It provides a practical and data -based solution for what can often be subjective evaluation. EDI aims to provide a standard for decentralization. The Edi index is a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in understanding the decentralization of Blockchain. The group continues to work hard for this project and we can expect more comprehensive results in the future when they further study the multifaceted aspects of Blockchain decentralization. We can expect more top projects to be added to the index. EDI is a cooperative project with the participation of some universities. The transparency is the core value of the EDI group. They only rely on public APIs and on-chain data. away from all private data or APIs. The EDI project covers the open source characteristics. invites anyone who contributes. gives new insights or adjusts the EDI according to their specific requirements. The group committed to providing information about their methodology can access and will publish all their findings. EDI serves many subjects. from decentralized enthusiasts and investors to regulatory agencies. legal systems and governments. It desires to become an important source of information in the discussion of decentralized quality. The EDI project is sponsored by Input Output Global (IOG). one of the Cardano developers. This comes with IOG $ 4. 5 million funding for Edinburgh University. The cooperation between IOG and Edinburgh University aims to create a decentralized standard that can be measured for the Blockchain industry. no organization has sponsored a project similar to EDI. There is an urgent need for such initiatives in the field of crypto. Some criticism claimed that Edi could be tasted cardano by IOG. the groups commitment to transparency and openness has dispelled these concerns effectively. Access the Edi index pages. The Edi index shows seven separate charts. each showing the results for seven outstanding blockchain: Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash. Litecoin. Tezos and Zcash. Lets start exploring each chart details. The first chart in the Edi index indicates the Nakamoto coefficient. Nakamoto coefficient is a measure of decentralized level of blockchain. It is determined by counting the minimum number of entities producing more than 50% of the total number of blocks in a certain time frame. The output of this data is an integer. The higher Nakamoto coefficient indicates a higher decentralized level. if the Nakamoto coefficient is 1. that means a unique entity. such as a single group. creating more than half of the network in the network. showing a high level of concentration.',\n",
       " ' The results referring to the entities that can create blocks. regardless of the resources may be authorized by some other entities for these entities (for example. the exploitation person authorizes the hash ratio for a group. the Stake person authorizes token to a group. with the Nakamoto coefficient of 58. surpasses other blockchains in this figure. Compare. Bitcoin and Ethereum have a significant lower Nakamoto coefficient of 2. Tezos. with a coefficient 7. ranked in second place. it is interesting to note that community tools often report the Nakamoto coefficient at about 35. nearly half of the report of the EDI index to Cardano. The difference between the results of scientists and community tools should be investigated. newer blockchain shows higher decentralization. It is predicted that when Avalanche. Solana and other similar projects appear on the Edi index. they will surpass the decentralization of traditional projects. the true question is how these projects will confront Cardano. Despite its current dominance. Cardanos position may not be as solid as the present. Gini coefficient shows the level of inequality in block production. The output of the data is a decimal range between 0 to 1. The values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bare nearly zero. which indicates equal (all entities in the system that produces the same number) and the values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bare nearly one that indicates the inequality (an entity that produces most or all blocks). In a perfect scenario of absolute equality. each node in the network will create equal number of blocks in the same time frame and receive the same reward. this will require a system of each person to vote. which cannot be achieved in a decentralized network. The number of blocks generated by each entity depends on the resource that it is available. whether directly owned or authorized. It is noteworthy that most blockchain networks tend to increase inequality. Cardano tops this data with a score of 0. 906. Tezos followed in second place. reaching 0. 967. Bitcoin guarantees third place with a score of 0. 974. In the Edi index. EnDy shows the amount of information expected in the distribution of blocks between entities. The output of the data is a real number. the higher Entropy value shows a higher level of decentralization (lower prediction). In the context of Blockchain network. the higher Entropy value is often considered better for decentralized processes. Entropy measures the unpredictable or random data of data. If Entropy is high. it means that the data is very random and therefore very difficult to predict. it is difficult to predict which node will create the next block. This unpredictable properties contribute to enhancing the security and fairness of the network. because it prevents any single nodes from dominating the production process. It ensures that power and control do not focus on a few nodes but instead spread online. This is an important aspect of maintaining a healthy and strong decentralized system. Cardano occupies the first position with a value of 8. In the second position. Tezos with a value of 5.',\n",
       " ' The third is Bitcoin Cash with a value of 3. The Herfindahl-Horschman (HHI) index is a measure of the market level. It is defined as the square of the market share (in the form of integer. for example 40 for 40%) of the entities in the system. The output of the data is a real number in the range of 0 to 10000. which indicates low concentration (many entities that create similar blocks) and nearly 10000 values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bindicate high concentration (an entity that produces most or all blocks). The closer the market is. the higher the level of the market (and the lower the level of its competition). The US Department of Justice has set the following thresholds to interpret HHI values \\\\u200b\\\\u200b(in traditional markets):. In a regular market. as well as in a decentralized market. high competitiveness is a healthy and desirable feature. Tezos and Bitcoin Cash. with values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bof 82. 604 and 1068. have emerged as top -active tokens. Their network shows high competitiveness. with many units producing equivalent blocks. the level of market concentration has to be observed in other projects. Theil index is another measure of Entropy aims to capture the lack of diversity or redundancy in a population. it is calculated in maximum entry can deducted Enropy observed. Theil index is used to measure resource allocation (such as wealth or income) among network participants. The output is a real number. indicating equality and values \\\\u200b\\\\u200btowards extremely indicating inequality. the high -high index shows that the resource allocation is highly concentrated. Cardano emerged with a score of 2. Bitcoin and Tezos shared the second position with a score of 3. Ethereum dropped behind with a score of 7. making it the worst. The Max Power index indicates the ratio of blocks created by the most strong entities. the entity produces the most blocks. In an ideal decentralized network. no single entity has a significant advantage in the production of blocks compared to other entities. in fact we often see the rise of power centers. This allows comparing the power of the most dominant entity compared to the rest. In this figure. Cardano leads with a value of 0. 049. Tezos followed in second place with a value of 0. 150 and Bitcoin Cash ranked third with a value of 0. 162. It seems that there is a difference to Bitcoins data because its value has suddenly decreased from 0. 3 to 0. which can indicate the error in the chart. The decentralized index is the general of the Nakamoto coefficient. It is defined as the minimum number of entities to create more than a certain threshold of the total number of blocks in a certain time frame. The threshold parameter is the decimal number between 0 to 1 (0. 66 by default) and the output of the data is integer. This measure is similar to the Nakamoto coefficient. although the threshold is placed at 66%. The results may closely reflect the results of the Nakamoto coefficient but have the potential to bring greater value.',\n",
       " ' Cardano ensures Slot Leader with a score of 118. followed by Tezos at second place with a score of 14. Bitcoin and Ethereum are set with score 3. only 1 point higher than the Nakamoto coefficient. Cardano has won all the indicators. a success that can be related to its position as one of the latest Blockchain POS networks on the EDI index. along with the same old Tezos blockchain. is the oldest blockchain. shows the worst results in certain figures and generally under the standard level in other data. a relatively old blockchain. has moved from POW to POS. did not notice significant improvements about decentralized ability after conversion. the Nakamoto coefficient does not change. Herfindahl-Hurschman (HHI) index even decreased. This result shows how significantly different from the POS network. As stated in the article. decentralized is not only related to the consensus mechanism of the network. Other aspects are important. in governance. Cardano may not work best because of the genesis key. the IOG group will solve this shortcoming. Cardano will improve this index over time. similar to the significant improvement to see after Hardver Shelley provides Stake. Administration related data is not available in the Edi index.March 2. A decentralization is a basic feature of the public blockchain. as it helps ensure that the network is safe. flexible and against censorship or intervention. not all blockchain projects are given decentralized at the same level and some can even sacrifice it to get other goals such as expandable ability. Even prestigious projects like Ethereum. in the advanced development stage. can still have decentralized weaknesses. This is why it is important to compare different blockchain protocols objectively. That way. we can better understand the strengths and weaknesses of different projects and how they measure this important aspect of Blockchain technology. A decentralization is a major feature of the public blockchain network. as it helps ensure that the network is safe and against censorship or intervention. In a decentralized blockchain. power is distributed between a large number of participants. instead of focusing on a single entity. This can make it more difficult for any agent in controlling or manipulating the network. Although in fact. that decentralization is within the range of security and the ability to expand. a very important indicator to evaluate the first class blockchain. a measurement system as we know from other industries that do not exist. the decentralized index of Edinburgh works. The decentralized index of Edinburgh (EDI) is an index developed by the University of Edinburgh in collaboration with IOG. to measure the decentralized level of Crypto. From this index. it is possible to make real and objective measurements about the decentralization of a blockchain project. There have been a number of different approaches and data used to measure decentralization in crypto. such as the original token distribution data. the number of individual stake wallets and the total number of authentication nodes or Stake Pool. These figures may help indicate the decentralization of a specific type of crypto.',\n",
       " ' but they may not provide a complete picture. EDI aims to add value to these existing figures by providing standard criteria to set and measure decentralized. If successfully applied to the crypto field. this index can help lay the foundation for reality realization of real decentralization in the Blockchain industry. The development of EDI is an important step to understand the decentralization of the Blockchain network. Once completed. this index will provide a standard and objective method to measure the decentralization of crypto types such as Bitcoin. Cardano and other types. This will be especially useful when comparing the decentralization of different blockchain networks and determining which network is the most decentralized. EDI was developed for several months and its methodology framework was introduced at Edinburgh on November 18 and at #Ioscotfest. Source here. Because EDI is currently developing. we can only consider the preliminary data system and methodology. The goal of EDI is to provide a comprehensive and reliable decentralized measure in Blockchain networks. EDI will use a range of data from many different industries. including economics. information theory and network science. To achieve this goal. EDI analyzes blockchain systems into multiple layers. called class. including many different categories. The floors that EDI focus on include: API. Tokenomics. Consensus. Software and Hardware. The source is here. illustrating the method: The classes of the blockchain system. identifying some types of resources in two of the classes (tokens. peer -to -peer network). assigning the public to the parties that show a higher and lower level of decentralization (network) and an example of equal common ownership for a token. the EDI will analyze the parameters of these classes objectively and technically to evaluate the decentralization of a specific blockchain network. The source here. overview of blockchain decentralized classes. Each of these classes plays an important role in understanding the decentralization of the Blockchain network. EDI will check each floor to determine any potential risks for decentralization related to the relevant attributes of Blockchain. such as safety. privacy and stability. concentrating at a consensus level may increase the risk of being attacked in transaction authentication. concentrated at token levels may increase the risk of price manipulation and concentrated at the network level may increase the risk of failure or censorship through infrastructure. To evaluate decentralization. Edi will collect data on different aspects of the blockchain system and assign weight to these figures. The later figures will be condensed into a single indicator showing the overall decentralization of a system. Edi aims to provide a comprehensive and objective measure of decentralization in blockchain networks. And with EDI. each blockchain will have an easy -to -understand quantitative assessment. anyone can access to make a wise decision. This index is being developed by a group of researchers and engineers from the University of Edinburgh and Input Output HK (IOG). The team cooperates with Blockchain Technology Laboratory (BLT). supervised by Dr. Daniel Woods. lecturer on network security at the University of Edinburgh. and Professor Aggelos Kiayias. chief scientist at IOG and network security and network security president of Edinburgh University.',\n",
       " ' Privacy. The next steps in the development process include. After the EDI is completed. it brings objective. systematized. quantified and transparent measurement frameworks for the blockchain industry. currently being dominated by excitement. insufficient information and non -structural data. EDI will help bring clear and understanding of different blockchain protocols. allowing managers. users and policies to make a wise decision on application and use of them. EDI can also be founded for describing the characteristics of digital assets. With some debate about how to classify assets. decentralization has become an important factor. EDI can become a useful tool for legislators and managers. the software that collects and analyzes data for the EDI will be an open source. This means that anyone can understand the theoretical foundation of EDI and regenerate its results. By providing the first goals and decentralized index equivalent to the field of Crypto. IOG and the University of Edinburgh. striving to raise awareness about decentralization in the blockchain industry. They actively participate in the development of an objective index that allows objective measurement of decentralization on different protocols. This will increase transparency and allow more wise comparison between different blockchain projects. By establishing a criteria for decentralization. Edi is helping to promote the development industry and ensure that decentralization is still the main focus in the development of blockchain technology.March 1. Global Output Input (IOG) has announced a new initiative called XSY. pronouncing EKSY. The specific details of this project. covered by a marketing term. are difficult to decode. Although there are many advertising terms. it seems that the project will involve creating a new stablecoin. The project was announced in October 2023 with the appointment of W. Sean Ford as CEO and David Markley as Deputy General Director. Both Ford and Markley have joined IOG to lead a new joint venture focused on Stablecoin. David Markleys career history is very interesting. He is an active leader and multi -faceted product. At Algorand. he leads operating groups. joint ventures and business solutions. He also participated in the project of Algorand to build the worlds first national digital currency. Token Marshallese. Marshallese Sovereign (SOV) is the first national digital currency in the world. It was introduced by the Marshall Islands in 2018. SOV is not representing local legal tokens but also an independent token. Algorand was chosen as a technology partner for this project. Algorands protocol is deployed to provide speed SOV initiatives. expansion. security and compulsory compliance control measures such as identity management. SOV is designed to circulate with the US dollar. used as an official currency in the country and helped the Marshall Islands operate effectively in the global economy. SOV supply is fixed by algorithm to grow at 4% per year to prevent inflation. This success is rarely mentioned in the blockchain industry. but it is one of the most powerful solutions. And other similar projects are being prepared. Wyoming. a famous state with crypto -friendly rules. embarked on the initiative to release a new type of stablecoin.',\n",
       " ' This initiative is part of the Wyoming stable token law. enacted in February 2022 and became the law in March 2023. The law allows the release of a Stablecoin type that was closed in the US dollar that could be changed to a state -owned legal currency in the account. The Token Stablecoin Wyoming Committee. established by the State Legislative Agency. is responsible for this project. The committee is responsible for deciding the total number of tokens will be issued. making requests to buy back and select financial institutions to manage tokens. Some blockchain projects are participating in discussions around this initiative. including Cardano and Ethereum. It seems that the project will be multi -foundation. This initiative shows an important step towards the integration of blockchain technology into the traditional financial system. it is important to note that the project is still in the first stage and more details may appear when the project progresses. Based on existing information. it seems Emurgo. not IOG. just participated in discussions about Stablecoin initiatives in Wyoming. the official commercial branch and the founding unit of Blockchain Cardano. proposed to support Wyomings Stablecoin Token Stablecoin initiative. For XSY. there is no specific mention of its participation in the Stablecoin initiative in Wyoming based on existing information. We think that XSY is not involved in the debate in any way. One thing is for sure: governments are showing interest in the release of many different types of stablecoin on Blockchain. This is not necessarily the use of public blockchain; Governments can choose a private blockchain version/are allowed to communicate with public blockchain. we predict that one of the project directions will be to discover this field to find new business opportunities. Although it has not yet been clarified whether XSY will introduce a stablecoin that is supported in USD or by algorithm. but it is likely that they can explore both options. a strong supporter of Stablecoin algorithm. may drive IOG in this direction if they start a new business project. That is XSY. the community is getting more and more about a new version of DJED. more efficient economically. The emphasis on this economic efficiency is also reflected in the XSY launch notice. It is important to remember that Charles Hoskinsons visionary project involves an algorithm stablecoin anchored by crypto assets. Perhaps XSY is the expected project that can turn this into reality. In addition to developing new technologies. the notice also refers to the formation of partnership. These cooperation aims to bring more predictable results by enhancing market access and use as well as promoting economic growth. specific details. such as the number of partnerships and related entities. are still unclear. It is possible that these activities will reflect the activities performed in places like the Marshall or Wyoming Islands. XSY aims to solve problems related to the inefficiency such as high costs in cross -border transactions. without financial services and extreme monetary fluctuations in developing countries. These issues significantly hinder the global population to access essential goods or services.',\n",
       " ' earn sustainable income and accumulate wealth. The new initiative sought to open up economic access through blockchain technology. XSY aims to provide necessary tools with the cooperation of partners to provide reliable technology. The ultimate goal is to create a series of creative and diverse digital assets. not only complementary to traditional financial instruments but also stablecoins supported by legal money. Sean Ford and David Markley are all talented leaders with the ability to successfully implement the project. Their last performance was very commendable. Despite the vague of the groups mission due to unclear statements. the road ahead is still clear. The financial context is highly fluctuated. both in the field of crypto and in developing countries. where traditional currencies are being inflation. There is a significant discussion in the Cardano ecosystem of stablecoin supported by USD. but the reality is currently no one exists. XSY introduces a new type of stablecoin can significantly improve the ecosystem. the notice is lacking in detail and does not provide any specific targets or timelines. we basically know that something is going on but the specific detail is still unclear. The community will appreciate more direct communication. See also the article of IOG here.February 29. In the field of decentralized application (DApps). unfortunate users can become victims of malicious people. These bad guys can deceive users to sign transactions leading to the withdrawal of assets from their wallets. This problem is especially common in the Ethereum ecosystem and is not only due to its larger scale. In Ethereum. users often authorize DAPPS to transfer any of their assets from their wallet in the future. Although this feature may seem convenient. it is often exploited by toxic entities. often called Ethereum withdrawal. Such incidents are less common in the Cardano ecosystem. we will explain why that. the smart contract should not have an owner or any mechanism that allows owners to transfer assets from smart contracts to external addresses. This attribute gives smart contracts reliability. Users can confidently entrust their property for a smart contract (trust in the code. not human). peace of mind knowing that no third party can manipulate these properties. users do not need to put their faith in the smart contract implementing group. it is possible to combine the money transfer function into the smart contract. allowing the owner of a smart contract to transfer tokens from smart contracts to other addresses. Such features are often related to toxic smart contracts. The Ethereum withdrawal tool contains Transferfrom function used to transfer digital assets from the users wallet to smart contracts. the transfer (money transfer) function is used to transfer assets to the address of the attacker. The transferfrom function is often used by DApps and is part of the ERC-20 token standard. It allows a smart contract to transfer a certain amount of tokens from one address to another. provided that the source address has approved the smart contract to do so. More information about the following approval. When assets are controlled by smart contracts (ownership).',\n",
       " ' the transfer function can be used to transfer them from smart contracts to other addresses. Transfer function is also part of the ERC-20 token standard. It is used to transfer the tokens directly from the callers address to another address. In the context of smart contracts. if there is a money transfer function that allows the owner to transfer the token contract from the contract to any external address. it may be a sign of a toxic contract. The address may be controlled by the attacker. Those who withdraw Ethereum wallets for abuse Approve (approval). When interacting with smart contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem. users often have to approve the contract to spend a certain amount of tokens from their wallets. This is called the Approval Token transaction (approving the token). for non -toxic use cases. this is very useful. Users can approve DApps to buy assets at target prices without transferring assets from the wallet first. The transfer will take place at an appropriate time. After the Approve transaction is signed. the smart contract may call the Transferfrom function at any time without requesting any additional approval or action from the user. Transferfrom function is an online transaction and requires gas fee. this fee is automatically paid from the users wallet. Both Approve and Transferfrom transactions require gas fees. The attackers often trick the user to call the function of a toxic contract. allowing it to use Transferfrom to remove the token from the users wallet. Money transfer function can be used similarly if the contract is designed to accept and hold the token. The attack begins with social techniques. The attacker must create a convincing scam or toxic Dapps. They often pay for Google to display their fraudulent site users in the first link form. There are many ways to cheat users and lure them into traps. Toxic Dapps can be a fake version of the popular DEFI service (DEX or the loan platform) or the new Dapps promises to bring high profits. It can also be attractive when casting a NFT string. Stake token to farm productivity or participate in selling tokens. Users access toxic websites or dapps and decide to interact with it. To interact with Dapps. users are required to connect their Ethereum wallets. After the wallet is connected. DApps will ask users to sign Approve transactions. Users are required to approve the spending of large amounts of tokens. usually the maximum amount possible. Users may not be suspicious because they often sign Approve transactions in the case of non -toxic Dapps. They may not pay attention to important details. A user confirms the transaction in their wallets without realizing that he has granted a toxic smart contract to use all his tokens. After the transaction is confirmed. the toxic smart contract may call the transfer function (or transferfrom) at any time to withdraw all the approved tokens from the users wallet. Can recover the approval of being granted for an Ethereum smart contract. This process is often called the recovery of token allowances or token approval.',\n",
       " ' The approval is an online transaction. So users will have to pay gas. Some users may hesitate to revoke the token approval due to the relevant fees. in most cases. the attacker acted quickly. so users did not have time to realize that they had made mistakes. In both the Cardano and Ethereum ecosystem. there is a risk of an attacker who can deceive you to sign a transaction of more assets than you intend. Unlike Ethereum. Cardanos smart contract has no equivalent approval mechanism. This means that smart contracts cannot be issued with unlimited access to the users wallet. toxic smart contracts cannot get money from the users wallet if the user does not sign clear transactions for each transfer. Smart contracts in Cardano are basically authentication. These instructions are automatically executed by each Node Cardano when authenticating a transaction trying to transfer money from the address of the instruction. The difference between Cardanos UTXO model and Ethereums account -based model is very significant when it comes to the possibility of withdrawal. Cardano uses the UTXO model in which the property is stored in the output form that has not been spent instead of the balance in the account. In this model. a transaction with output head. in which inputs are output that has not been spent from previous transactions. Each UTXO can only be consumed once and all that UTXO itself. no approval function is equivalent to Ethereum in Cardanos UTXO model. a transaction only involves a limited number of UTXOs that users own in their wallets. Any UTXO is not put into operation in the transaction is still not affected by the transaction signature. From security perspectives. this model can be considered to be able to resist better wallet attacks. You can see in the picture that Alice must sign all UTXO spending transactions. Smart contracts cannot arbitrarily transfer UTXO owned by Alice. An Ethereum account. represented by a single address. can hold the balance of many different types of tokens. including many different ERC-20 tokens. The approval function usually does not approve the spending for the entire account. it provides a specific smart contract for a certain amount of money from Token ERC-20 from the users account. toxic smart contracts may accidentally be approved to use tokens from the entire users account. The approval mechanism may be exploited by malicious smart contracts to withdraw the token from the users wallet without asking for any additional approval or action from the user. you can see that Alice only signed Approve. This allows for malicious smart contracts to transfer all tokens from her account. In order to prevent the loss of all properties from their accounts. users should ensure that they only approve spending on reliable and reliable smart contracts. The Approve approval function of Ethereum provides developers with a feature that allows third parties to periodically withdraw a certain amount from your bank account. Although this is a useful function. it requires users to believe that third party will not exceed their withdrawal limit.',\n",
       " ' Cardano does not provide the same feature for developers. Users are clearly signed for each UTXO spending transaction from their wallet. Both approaches are of their value. The corresponding development groups must achieve a balance between security and provide many options for developers when creating smart contracts. Although Cardanos instructions are designed to verify whether the UTXO spending conditions are met or not. Ethereums smart contract can gain control of user accounts.February 28. Butane protocol has created a wave in the community. The group has mobilized nearly 50 million ADA in the BTN token public sale. As Charles Hoskinson pointed out. this impressive achievement surpassed the amount of Ethereum collected during its ICO. go into detail of the groups ambitious plan for this project. Butane is a Rollup protocol that allows users to create synthetic assets. These are financial instruments that simulate other tools without possessing material. Synthetic assets are tokens imitating the value of another type of crypto or any other real world property without practicing ownership. the general version of Bitcoin on Blockchain Cardano will imitate the price of the actual BTC. allowing you to benefit from the price change without owning the actual BTC. The Butane protocol allows users to send a variety of collateral assets to cast synthetic assets (butane can support any CNT as collateral). These synthetic assets can then be traded on Blockchain Cardano. providing users with access to many types of assets without having to own them directly. The mortgaged debt position (CDP) in the context of the Butane protocol is a smart contract that allows users to send a property (collateral) and borrowed synthetic assets based on that property. It is like borrowing money. in which collateral is what you give to guarantee. When you open the CDP in the Butane protocol. you send a property (like ADA) and in return CDP will give you a loan. This loan is in the form of synthetic assets. If your collateral value decreases too much. CDP will be liquidated to ensure that the loan can be refunded. although synthetic assets and CDP can bring financial opportunities. they are also risky. Cardano ecosystem has a CDP protocol called Indigo. this is the most successful DEFI project with approximately US $ 100 million. Thanks to the Indigo protocol. it is possible to trade the synthetic assets of IBTC. Ieth and IUSD on many DEX. Indigo allows people to create synthetic property. called IASSETS. These IASSETs can be created by using currencies like Stablecoin and ADA. They have a price impact similar to the holding of property. This allows users to profit from the price increase of a property without owning that property. In the Crypto industry. MakerDao stands out as one of the most successful CDP protocols. MakerDaos treasury is the main product of the DEFI ecosystem. accounting for the majority of the total locked value in the DEFI protocols and platforms. MakerDaos TVL is about $ 9 billion. Users can open the treasury. deposit assets (such as ETH) and create Dai Stablecoin.',\n",
       " ' If the value of collateral decreases too much. the treasury may be liquidated to ensure that the loan can be refunded. the Solana and Avalanche ecosystems do not have any successful CDP protocol. BTN. the original token of the Butane protocol. serves many purposes including administration. Stake and as an option to pay CDP interest. you can see full details about the BTN token system. Butane Protocol stands out with improved features. It introduces an independent automatic liquidation system. minimizing congestion and enhancing expansion. This ensures faster and more efficient liquidation transactions. Butane also revealed a flexible mortgage method. allowing users to lock multiple tokens as collateral. each token with a weight can be configured. This promotes risk diversification and encourages users participation. The flexible collateral and quick liquidation of the protocol leads to faster reaction adjustment. contributing to creating a stronger key level. The diversity. along with the ability to maintain the exchange rate effectively. creating confidence in the valuation of butane synthesis. leading to lower user fees. With a significant budget in hand. the group certainly has the potential to provide a high quality product. The ability to trade assets in the real world such as stocks or even ETFs on Cardano will be a significant advantage. If the project succeeds in achieving this. it may be a great success.February 27. In the field of blockchain technology. decentralization is considered its foundation. it is often covered by legendary Cloud and misconceptions. This concept. although important. is not as simple as people think. Measuring decentralization or comparing different blockchains is a complex challenge. This article aims to clarify these complex things. Through the use of illustrations. we will go into the basic principles of decentralization. bringing more clear understanding of this indispensable feature of Blockchain technology. Join us when we start this enlightenment journey. The term decentralized refers to networks. systems and applications without central control. This concept is the key to peer -to -peer network (P2P). where nodes share data directly. ignoring intermediaries. In the blockchain industry. the term decentralized is often used loose. Initially it only refers to the network architecture. but the characteristics of the blockchain project far beyond this. They include project management. source maintenance groups. administrators and resources distribution to ensure the networks consensus mechanism. focus on network architecture. The dispersed network spreads on a large area and has many nodes to process and store data. This distribution increases efficiency. readiness. integrity and security. The image below illustrates a scattered network. Each node operated by an individual will run an internet jam machine application necessary for peer -to -peer network communication. In the network. each node has the same power. In a decentralized context. we can argue that there are 8 entities with equal status in the network. Node collaborates to disseminate and verify transactions. They can perform many other tasks. Every user can interact directly with each other using peer -to -peer online communication model. The dispersed network may be decentralized (no central agency) or concentrated control.',\n",
       " ' In the image below. you can see the disperse network like before with 8 nodes. The difference is that all nodes are controlled by a single entity. Alice (red arrow illustrates the control of nodes). A network may have very similar characteristics of the effectiveness. the availability of data and strength. but it is concentrated. affecting integrity. data security. Alice can decide to turn off all nodes. thereby turning off the entire network. She can also change data because she has full control of it. A decentralized network lacks a central agency. The focus of decentralization is the network consent mechanism. which is the rules that nodes use to reach an agreement on changing the status of the ledger periodically. There is no only internet control. ensuring democracy. Anyone can freely participate or leave the network. Instead of a single central agency. the network is determined by a group of entities sharing power with each other. A decentralized network requires protection against Sybil attacks. which we will discuss later. The distribution of power must be based on owning an expensive resource. For POW networks like Bitcoin. it is a combination of ASIC and electric hardware. while for POS networks like Cardano or Ethereum. which is the corresponding ADA and ETH token. This creates an imbalance in the system because the entities are often different. Richer people who can obtain more expensive multi -resources will hold a stronger position in a decentralized network. The image below illustrates a decentralized. decentralized network that is determined by the number of POS copper that each individual holds. It seems that contradictory entities own valuable resources can control dispersed networks without node operation. In many networks. these resources owners may authorize their resources. thus improving the power of other nodes. Contrary to the usual thought. decentralization is not assessed by the number of nodes in the distributed network. it is determined by distributing and managing an expensive resource between those who hold it. such as their authorized options. In the dispersion network. certain nodes are more important and have the privilege of creating new blocks. The term distribution refers to the Node geographic distribution to improve efficiency. availability and reliability. Although anyone can contribute to their network with their node. that does not significantly improve the decentralization of the network. The term decentralized focus on lack of control. requires allocation of decision -making power. A decentralization is not determined by the ownership of node but by owning an expensive resource. Open blockchain network. allowing a person to run many nodes. they are not immune to Sybils attacks. To fight these things. decentralization must be based on owning a scarcity/expensive resource. causing risks of loss of wealth. This ensures the commitment and honesty of the owner of the resource. A Sybil attack occurs when an entity creates many fake identities to gain control. The attacker aims to affect decisions. data manipulation or network breaks. A decentralization should not only rely on the ability to operate node.',\n",
       " ' because a single entity can run a lot of nodes at a cheap price. Consider a network in which each connected node has the right to create a new block and earn rewards. To increase the chances of receiving bonuses. one can run many customers. Sybil attackers can exploit this. running many low -cost nodes to achieve unfair advantages compared to honest participants. The image below describes a situation in which the Sybil attacker operates five nodes. If an entity has a majority control over the production or mass management. the network will be concentrated. The dispersed internet attribute does not significantly affect decentralization. Although the nodes protect data and verify transactions. they cannot directly participate in the consent or administration mechanism if the operator does not own expensive resources. Most node are data consumers. mainly consumers of new blocks. If they do not own expensive resources. they cannot participate in data production (block). The production of blocks is managed by expensive resources owners. They determine that the nodes will create new blocks. This design protects against Sybil attacks. The image shows that only Alice. Bob. Carol and Dave own a certain amount of valuable resources. Bob has the most. while Dave has the least. these four blocks can produce new blocks. Eve. Frank. Grace and Heidi. lacking this resource. with nodes only consuming new blocks. Note that the Sybyl attack cannot be performed on this network. The position of the Sybyl attacker will be the same as Eve. his node will be consumers passive new blocks. To attack this cyber. people will need to get expensive resources. This can be done directly by buying it. thus risking their wealth. they can indirectly get it through frauds. such as POS stealing money or gaining control of a large mining company ratio. these indirect methods are often more complicated. control depends on expensive resource owners. not node operators. Resources can be owned by a large number of people. but only a few nodes in the distributed network are important for block production. And although the network has thousands of nodes. only a few have been chosen to actively participate in the network consent mechanism. while the rest are passive data consumers. If a passive node suddenly is not available or even all passive nodes. it will hardly affect the network consent mechanism. the opposite is not true. If half of the node is operating suddenly. the network may not reach the network consensus mechanism. it is important that the owner of the resource and their decision is that node becomes important to the network. Resources owners may use their resources to produce blocks. but this often requires a significant amount. More normally. they authorize resources to another entity that operates a node actively participating in the network consent mechanism. creating blocks. Images show a decentralized network. Only the nodes of Alice. Carol and Dave create blocks. Bob and Carol own a small part of expensive resources. All others are active participants.',\n",
       " ' They authorize resources to one of the operators running node producing blocks (blue arrows display resource authorization). Note that among all delegates. only Olivia. Rupert and Wendy operate their passive node (using only new blocks). An expensive resource may be ADA for Cardano or Hash Rate for Bitcoin. In the scenario of Bitcoin. you will find an ASIC and power exploitation tool instead of tokens. Bitcoin and Cardano work in the same basic way. This is the decentralization of a typical blockchain network. Summarize it. 16 units participated in a decentralized but only 14 units owned expensive resources. Alice and Dave runs block production but does not own expensive resources. There are 7 nodes in the dispersed network. but only 4 nodes of them produce blocks. 3 Node consumes new blocks. the number and ratio between different participants will be different. The network usually has more people who authorize more than block production nodes. Some networks. have a huge number of nodes. but only a small part of positive creates blocks (Bitcoin only has about 20 groups. including 2 dominant groups). in networks like Cardano. most nodes are involved in the production of blocks. Cardano has thousands of pools. There are Pool Stake operators running in many groups. In order to fully grasp the complexity of decentralized. we must consider the role of the group. Up to now. we have discussed the control of block production. including authorized people (deposit or mining) and block production nodes. Participants actively agree periodically about the ledgers status changes. mainly through the addition of new bloc. based on rules determined by customers. It is important to know who controls the rules. This is usually the group that has given Blockchain. It is usually the first workstation application group. The drawing shows the situation in which a group releases three versions of workstation. The operator can freely choose the workstation version that will install on their node. thereby determining which protocol rules they will apply and which protocol rules will be implemented mainly on the distributed network. In a decentralized network. the group only has limited control of rules. All versions of the workstation (maybe even the replacement versions) are provided publicly. The group does not (should not) have the control of any workstation version that the operator installs on their nodes. One of the common mistakes is that when a group has a clear leader. he can change the rules of the network or even turn off the network. without the necessary amount of resources. it is impossible to change the main features of the protocol as a monetary policy. In case there is no dispute between the group. the community and the node operator. it will tend to install the latest workstation version. This version will not change the main rules. only make minor changes (correction. minor improvements) or upgrade that most agrees. In case of disputes over the rules. the owner of a valuable resource will have the most influence. The person who holds their resources authorized resources to the Node operator.',\n",
       " ' who is responsible for selecting the version for installation. If the authorized person disagrees with the selection of the operators version. they have the option to authorize their resources elsewhere. executives must carefully consider choosing their version. paying attention to the interests of the authorized person. Images illustrating a scenario in which two groups of Alpha and Omega release a workstation app with separate and incompatible protocol rules. Three operators run Node to produce the Alpha version. while the other three operators choose the Omega version. The owner of the resource will identify the executable rules. In this specific case. most expensive resources voted for the Omega version. In most existing networks. a customer often dominates. It is unusual for some replacement workstation development groups and when they do so. this version often represents minority. This is evident in the case of Ethereum. Disputes often arise about different versions by the same production group. A faction in the group can create a source code and modify rules. making them not compatible with the original version. This new version can be executed but it needs support from expensive resource owners. In order for the new version to win. most of expensive resources must support it. Just like the production of blocks and networks managed by expensive resource owners. This is very important in the context of Sybil attacks. If the application of the new version is determined by the number of nodes running a certain version of the workstation. then the Sybil attacker. can assign countless IP addresses in an inexpensive way. can order network rules. Administration should be protected against Sybils attacks. Honest acts must be executed by the possibility of losing a persons wealth. A decentralization mainly revolves around the distribution of an expensive resource. Only authorized people can affect the number of feasible blocks (groups) in the network. For decentralized exploration. first check the number of individuals who own resources. the popularity of whales among them and their resource management. it is important that there are many authorized resources groups. Some groups may have a dominant position. this is an unexpected phenomenon. The passive number of passive nodes in the network is not important for decentralization by the number of blocks. The distribution of expensive resources is also important for management. maintaining the rules that have been agreed by most resources. The testing network must be decided by the group or executive group. which is mainly decided by the owner of the resource. The availability of many replacement customers is beneficial. although not the standard.February 22. Circle made an immediate decision about stopping USDC on the tron \\\\u200b\\\\u200bplatform. The current USDC people have the option to transfer their USDC to another platform or exchange it for Fiat currency. Circle has not revealed the specific reason for their leaving Tron. leading to speculation of potential legal pressure. we continue to support the initiative to introduce Stablecoin to be supported by USD on Cardano platform. We appreciate and encourage the efforts of all community members to work towards this goal.',\n",
       " ' it is important to be careful and understand the risks related to Stablecoin supported in USD. About 70% of all Crypto transactions are related to Stablecoin. of which USDC and USDT are the most popular. This has been shown to be a profitable joint venture for both Circle and Tether. Tron is known for its relatively low fee and quick payment time. This is the place where Stablecoin business is booming. In terms of market capitalization Stablecoin. with 37% market share. is the second largest platform for the use of Stablecoin. after Ethereum with 52%. Tron surpasses Ethereum in terms of the amount of USDT. This is a popular platform to transfer money between exchanges. the use of tron \\\\u200b\\\\u200bis increasing in developing countries. where it is often used to buy goods in USDT. On the tron. users prefer USDT. accounting for 96% of Stablecoin market capitalization on this platform. And the decision to leave this platform of Circle will not lead to significant losses. Tethers making decisions like Circle is entirely possible. This will be a strong blow into the tron. What factors contribute to the success of Tron? Mostly. it depends on the continuous loyalty of Tether and the continuous USDT casting on this platform. Circle. Tether and other similar entities are managed companies. decisions leave a platform or may be all platforms. which can be affected by management agencies. Authorities can impose requirements for Tether and Circle companies to execute KYC/AML for users or can freeze accounts or suspend trading on demand. reflect traditional banking systems. Based on the decision of a third party will give the level of concentration. regardless of the decentralization of Blockchain. Because DEFI depends on Stablecoin. it is important to consider strategies to minimize risks. the crypto industry is mainly managed by two types of stablecoin supported in USDT and USDC. On certain platforms. these two types of stablecoin are shown the same. on some platforms. one of them holds the dominant position. This is risky. On the tron \\\\u200b\\\\u200bplatform. USDT dominates 96% of the market share. while on Base. USDC accounts for 91%. BSC and Arbitrum users mainly use USDT. accounting for about 75% of the use and on Avalanche. USDT dominates 68%. We can assume that if a stablecoin has a dominant position to leave the platform. another Stablecoin with the biggest presence will dominate. But this is a loss from decentralized views. USDT can be found on 62 platforms. proud of the total market capitalization of 97 billion USD. USDC is available on 61 platforms. with a total capitalization of 27 billion USD. The third place belongs to Stablecoin algorithm. present on 33 platforms and has a total market capitalization of 4. 8 billion USD. People really like stablecoins supported in USD more than algorithm stablecoin. Circles decision to abandon the tron \\\\u200b\\\\u200bwill be a warning to the Cardano community. The influence of Circle and Tether in the Crypto community is increasingly expanding. more than what people often notice.',\n",
       " ' If these entities decide to abandon a platform or be forced to do so. then basically. it may destroy the corresponding DEFI ecosystem. In the event of a Hardork of Ethereum Blockchain. these companies will basically determine which Ethereum is true. To prevent such a scenario. I imagine two potential solutions: promoting diversity and promoting the use of algorithm Stablecoiin. There are discussions that are going on the possibility of Circle deploying USDC on Cardano. Technology solutions. such as ERC-20-like tokens. have been proposed by community members to create favorable conditions for this. according to Charles Hoskinson. Circle does not care about Cardano not for financial or technology reasons. Please wait for the results of the negotiation. The cardano community should also consider the effort to combine USDT on its platform. which will include discussions with Tether. There are three types of stablecoin supported in USD. namely Mehen USDM. USDT and USDC. will create a more balanced environment than a platform as tron. the platform will soon depend completely on USDT. Greater autonomy from third -party entities. and therefore. a decentralized movement can be achieved through the use of Stablecoin algorithm. Although the current is not the hobby of DEFI users. it is essential to support this change. Crypto is decentralized and does not obey any specific jurisdiction. This makes them a favorable choice as collateral for Stablecoin. similarly. will not follow any specific legal area. we have DJED. an algorithm Stablecoin that has proved its strength in the context of the market price. Certainly. it is worth improving the algorithm and discovering ways to improve economic efficiency. it would not mean anything without Stablecoin supported in USD and only followed the path of stablecoin algorithm. The market has not been prepared for such a change. Cardano needs USDT and USDC as soon as possible. We can gradually towards a future where the algorithms are dominated. this conversion process may be a long -term and challenging process. Stablecoins are supported in USD. which is expected to work well. at least until the situation changes. The DEFI ecosystem must maintain independence with the financial corporations managed. We can hope the best but we have to prepare for the worst.February 20. The traditional financial sector possesses a remarkable advantage compared to the field of Blockchain. a aspect that has not been discussed. This advantage lies in the ability to recover superior to cyber attacks. IT experts and legal systems have effectively solved hacks. frauds and fraudulent activities. Although such incidents are not none. their appearance is significantly less than the incidents in the blockchain industry. For decentralized finance (DEFI) to promote its full potential. it must ensure the trust of users. This trust can only be set by significantly reducing the number of security incidents. The 2023 Privacy Report published by Certik issued an in -depth analysis of incidents and corresponding losses. thereby providing profound insights with value of security in the industry. Certik handles security incidents occurring on 24 platforms (including some layers 2 like Arbitrum or Polygon).',\n",
       " ' Cardano is also on this list. You can see the security report from Certik yourself. Look at the necessary numbers. A total of 1.840.879.064 USD lost in 751 security incidents by 2023. This figure shows a 51% reduction compared to a total of 3. 7 billion USD in 2022. this may be the result of a price market. In the upcoming price market. we can expect the increasing activities of scammers and hackers. When a market price attracts new users. of course it also attracts attackers. The report indicates that it is possible to observe a moderate positive relationship between the number of hacks and TVL. If TVL increases. the number of incidents will increase. It is important to note that the total financial loss in USD increases as the market price of indigenous tokens increases. Infelling private course is the most money method. with ~ 881 million USD lost after only 47 incidents. This accounts for nearly half of the total number of financial losses. although the infringement of the individual lock only accounts for 6. 3% of the total security incidents. The BNB chain has undergone the highest security incident. with a total of 387 hacks. frauds and exploitation leading to $ 134 million damage. Ethereum witnessed a total of 224 incidents but the loss of 686 million USD. It can be seen that the highest frequency of incidents tends to occur in the most used ecosystems. This is a reasonable trend in the viewpoint of an attacker. because these ecosystems often have the largest number of users and often hold the most money in their DEFI applications. In the figure below. you can see the number of incidents per platform and total financial damage. Look at the presentation of security problems. There are only 47 incidents of private courses but the total damage caused is the highest. There are 306 fraudulent escape cases but the total damage is the lowest compared to other cases. There are 197 coding holes. the second highest number of incidents. The total damage is relatively high. Consider one of the important incidents related to theft of separate locks. In July. Multichain was seriously violated leading to $ 125 million damage. It was later discovered that only the CEO controlled the servers and the separate key of the platform that is considered decentralized. This problem emerged when the CEO was arrested. making users unable to access US $ 1. 5 billion. The escalation of the money when the money begins to switch to an unknown wallet. highlighting the risks of centralized individual lock control. In the security report. you will find detailed information about the leak leak leak led to about 500. in some cases. even hard wallets (HW) may not be able to protect the users property. in the report. you will find detailed information about the Kyberswap hack. in which the attackers have abused the notorious flash loan. Surprisingly. despite the large number of security incidents. financial institutions are still promoting the application.',\n",
       " ' significant progress was achieved in the application of institutional blockchain technology. with important financial institutions such as Swift. Hong Kong Monetary Agency (HKMA) and Australian Bank and New Zealand (ANZ). We are gradually shifting from solutions to prove the concept to direct production. Swift focuses on blockchain interaction and is coding assets. showing the ability to connect different private and public blockchains. ANZ. with assets managed more than $ 1 trillion. launched Australias first personal stablecoin and coded carbon credit transactions. HKMA has issued US $ 100 million in encrypted green bonds. emphasizing the connection of coded bonds with current securities regulations. These advances show the growing acceptance of the potential of blockchain in traditional finance. paving the way for capital flow significantly into the blockchain. driven by tokens. It seems that the financial world finally switches to Blockchain. it turned out to interact with other conventional systems. such as depository systems and existing payment systems. very complicated in terms of technology. The risks related to this effort are great. Overcoming technological difficulties can lead to traditional organizations that apply blockchain and large amounts not only financial but mainly users. the ability to write such a smart contract will be as safe as possible. it will not contain holes. Although we can be happy about what has been achieved so far. we have to be cautious. The number of security incidents is still very high on the two smart contract platforms used as the Ethereum and BNB chains. The application of DEFI is not only related to organizations. It also talks about daily people who can benefit from using Stablecoin and decentralized financial applications. to accomplish this. the security of these platforms must be significantly enhanced. thereby reducing the number of security incidents. In the traditional financial world. infrastructure is a source of closing and concentration. managed by IT and security experts. Most frauds are detected and resolved by the legal system. This structure has advantages such as high level of control and fast response to threats. it also has limitations such as lack of transparency and potential risk of abuse of power. Blockchain resolves the limitations of centralized financial infrastructure. but does not bring other limitations. A decentralization will lose meaning for most users if they cannot reach the same security. DEFI users should prioritize open source projects. The open source is essentially more transparent and the participation of the community. which can lead to stronger and safer systems. it also poses special security challenges. This code is provided publicly to anyone who carefully reviews. including potential attackers. smart contracts must be thoroughly tested and practical testing over time to ensure their security. When these applications stand up to the challenge of time and prove their security. people will start using them more. This is a slow process because beliefs need to be built over time. Users need to feel confident that their assets are safe and the platform will work as expected. The less incidents. the more the user believes in this platform.',\n",
       " ' The application of DEFI is a multi -faceted process. not only related to organizations but also daily users. It requires a delicate balance between openness and security. As Defi continues to grow and develop. we may expect a large number of users to see the benefits of decentralization and potential of blockchain technology. Where is Cardano? In a report from Certik. it was not clearly mentioned in the context of security incidents. This is largely because TVL is lower than Ethereum and BNBCHAY. If the number of users and TVL increases. Cardano will attract the attention of the attackers. Cardano has a smart contract status of a platform that has never been hacked in DEFI. That may change quickly. Can not prevent frauds or different types of attacks. we all expect to see less holes in the source code. If you consider projects that according to the security report. some serious security incidents occur. you will find that their TVL is significantly smaller or similar to Cardanos TVL. For example: Base has a TVL of 400m. similar to TVL of Cardano. In total. 4 incidents occur. Core. Fantom. Scroll and ZKSYNC are projects with significantly smaller TVLs than Cardano and the attackers have succeeded in at least one case. it is possible to conclude that Cardano is an attractive smart contract platform for attackers. but they did not have any significant attacks (Certik will mention in the report). For the attackers. this is an attractive foundation on which tens of millions of dollars are locked. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being locked on Cardano. We may say that Cardano is most likely no hacks for the reason this is a safety foundation and a third -party code does not contain serious holes. In the coming years. the number of security incidents will be one of the main motivations to promote the application. DEFI services are often very similar from the users point of view. but basically they may vary in terms of security. If any smart contract platform. maybe Cardano or any other platform. becomes significantly safely safely compared to other platforms. it has the opportunity to gain significant market share. The fact that once the TVL of an ecosystem exceeds 1 billion USD. there will be at least 2 serious incidents that occur each year. This is still a very poor result in the context of how huge TVL may be if the application of a series starts. Solana and Optimism projects are on the right track because they have TVL about 1 billion USD or more but the number of security incidents is very low. Hope Cardano will join them.February 19. Building on Blockchain includes a model change from traditional programming and requires thorough understanding of the decentralized model of Blockchain. Smart contract developers have a specific function to develop decentralized applications (DApps). They have to build a safe dapps in the first test. we will explain the difference between normal application development and blockchain application. We will consider a script written in aiken and smart contract written in solidity.',\n",
       " ' The main difference between common programming language and blockchain language is the case of use and their design principles. Common -purpose programming languages \\\\u200b\\\\u200band can be used to develop many applications. blockchain languages \\\\u200b\\\\u200bare often designed with specific features to support the development of decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts (smart contracts). Developers use traditional programming languages \\\\u200b\\\\u200bwith a large number of libraries that allow them to write almost everything. These libraries have been developed by the global developer community for many years. providing the writing code for many functions from processing I/O files to complex machine algorithms. This large library ecosystem allows developers to build applications quickly and effectively without having to invent wheels. when it comes to blockchain development. the context is completely different. Blockchain programming languages \\\\u200b\\\\u200blike Solidity for Ethereum or Plutus for Cardano. although strong but no libraries have the same width and depth. This is partly due to the relative newness of blockchain technology and specific requirements of writing smart contracts. Blockchain programming languages \\\\u200b\\\\u200bare designed with specific coding and cash management. it may be creating a new type of token. determining control of tokens. money transfer conditions. Developers write smart contracts with logical control and coding rules in those contracts. they have no control over certain aspects of the Blockchain network. developers cannot control the passing of the network. which is the processing speed and add transactions to the blockchain. This is determined by many different factors such as the network protocol. the number of nodes and consensus algorithms are used. developers cannot control or prevent block manipulation of block manufacturers. The integrity of block production is maintained by the basic consensus algorithm of blockchain and network rules. Although developers may order the operation of their smart contracts. the execution they depends on (and may be limited by) Blockchain network. The separation of these concerns is a basic aspect of the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. It ensures that no one has full control of all aspects of the Blockchain network. thereby improving the security and reliability of the network. Although this is the desired feature of Blockchain. some developers may feel limited or depend on external factors. In the process of developing blockchain. the code is executed on the internet and must comply with the constraints of the Blockchain protocol. all operations in smart contracts consume a certain amount of gas and developers must write their contracts to save as possible. This usually means that smart contracts have a lower and clearer level of encryption style. once the smart contract is deployed on the blockchain. it cannot be changed. This immutability is a basic feature of Blockchain technology. but it also means developers have to get their code at the first time. There is no room for errors or security holes because they cannot be patched later. the process of smart contract development usually includes strict inspection and audit. This makes Dapps development longer and more expensive. Although understanding all the traps of programming on Blockchain is a challenge for new developers.',\n",
       " ' a decentralized model can cause another trap. The development of common applications is related to creating a centralized system in which a single entity has data control and function. This is in stark contrast to blockchain applications operating in a decentralized model. no entity has control over the entire network. the control is distributed between a network of nodes. Smart contracts are a basic part of blockchain applications. They are the contracts that make themselves with the terms of the agreement written directly into the code. They automatically perform transactions according to predefined rules without intermediaries. This automation reduces the risk of human errors and fraud. Because there is no room for errors. the smart contract must accurately implement what is expected in certain conditions. No third party is allowed to affect the performance of smart contracts or prevent it. The code is the law. If the process of executing smart contracts fails and unexpected errors occur. there is often no way to save the lost money. Another specific feature of Dapps development is that if a developer knows a environment. he may not be ready to develop on Cardano. Smart contract platforms may vary basically. Developers must be aware of the significant difference between smart contract platforms. as these differences can greatly affect the design. function and security of their applications. see the difference between the state and at the same time. Two outstanding smart contract platforms. Ethereum and Cardano. provide great examples of how these differences can manifest. especially in terms of state manipulation and simultaneous calculation. Ethereum works on an account -based model. the entire network shares the overall state. this status is updated with all blocks created. This overall state includes account balance and smart contract status. Ethereums model allows many users to interact with a smart contract in a single block. this shared change can lead to complexity and hidden holes. especially when transactions occur simultaneously. in this context refers to the ability to perform many transactions simultaneously. If not handled properly. this can lead to competition and other security holes. Cardano uses an unpaid output output model (EUTXO). the deposit and receipt of money are not stored in the form of a balance but in the form of unpaid transactions (UTXO) is linked to the address of the wallet. Each of this UTXO can only be used once. This model has been handled simultaneously. because each trading output can only be spent once and after being spent. it cannot be used by another transaction. this also means developers need to think differently about how they design smart contracts and handle state. Understanding these differences is important for developers to avoid errors and vulnerabilities in their smart contracts. ReEtranancy is a common gap in Ethereum Smart Contract. where the attacker can constantly call a function before the first function call ends. This is less interested in Cardano due to its Eutxo model. Although Ethereum and Cardano provide powerful platforms to develop decentralized applications. each platform has its own approach to handle the state and simultaneously.',\n",
       " ' Developers must understand these differences and their meaning for the development of smart contracts to effectively build safe and effective applications on these platforms. Developers who understand Solidity cannot easily switch to Cardano. In addition to learning a new programming language (Plutus. they also have to solve specific characteristics of a certain blockchain. The same thing applies when moving to Solana for example. The conversion from this blockchain platform to another blockchain platform is not only related to learning a new programming language. Each platform has architecture. consensus mechanism. transaction model. account model and smart contract function. the conversion from Java to C# can be easier for developers if they have experience with concepts such as working with the internet. database. cloud service. file system. Aiken is a functional programming language used to write a set of commands (smart contracts) for Cardano. you can see a very simple authentication. The script checks whether spending conditions are responded. The spending must provide the signature and the hello. the world!. the return value of the command is True. This will allow money spending. Check the functions available for developers. Among other things. the developer can use the byte array and compare them together. using some hash functions (blake2b_256. sha2_256 and sha3_256). working with time. performing basic arithmetic functions. working with string. For functions more related to Blockchain. developers can work with addresses. certificates and transactions. they can work with the values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bof tokens and tokens ADA. DAPPS for Cardano requires building on-chain and off-chain. Aiken is only for the on-chain. Developers can use any appropriate programming language to build off-chain. smart contracts are written in Aiken or Plutus is usually smaller because they are basically the authentication commands to determine whether the transaction is valid or not. They operate on the UTXO model. in which each trading output has a small logic (contract) to verify any transaction trying to spend it. the smart contracts of Ethereum. written in solidity. are the operating status applications on Blockchain and often have a higher complexity. They operate on an account -based model. in which contracts have a continuous state stored in the blockchain and functions that can change this status. you can see examples of digital token ownership management contracts and allow the transfer of those tokens between tokens owners. The first 4 lines of the contract shows the status stored in the blockchain. A small business application written in traditional object -oriented programming language may have thousands of codes. while a business application can easily have dozens to hundreds of thousands of source codes. For example: A Boeing 787 has 6. 5 million codes behind the aviation electronic system and online support. In terms of codes. Dapps is small in size compared to conventional applications. A simple Dapps may include a few smart contracts. each of which consists of several tens to several hundred codes. DAPPS is more complicated. such as decentralized trading floor or lending platform. which may include many smart contracts with thousands of codes.',\n",
       " ' Building Dapps is a new sector that attracts more and more developers each year. They can provide increasingly effective and user -friendly DAPPS. despite overcoming all the traps of decentralization and specific details of the development process on the blockchain. the development of games and applications for mobile phones is highly competitive and saturated. a group can easily establish and become a dominant player in this field. It is so attractive.February 18. Blockchain is the fastest growing industry in the world. mainly thanks to the activity and passion of the community that it serves as well as those who serve the developing ecosystem around it. we are never surprised by the creativity and passion of members in contributing to the management and future development of Cardano. Lets look at what happened last week. The 2024 calendar contains important and historical decisive moments. events and decisions. The main motivation this year for Cardano is to develop on-chain management capabilities at a minimum. We are very happy to update our roadmap. increase the level of detail of the year and allow our members and stakeholders to understand how the year will take place. Notable supplements in the roadmap include:. HardFork Chang- The upgrade Chang is the peak of many years of hard work. including all the participation of the community continuing to develop on Sanchonet. Upgrade Chang shows an important step towards the minimum on-chain management as defined in CIP-1694. After Stake Pool successfully upgraded their nodes to support the new protocol and DAPPS as well as the trading floor that integrated the new node. we will be able to upgrade to the new ledger era. this time we need something new because the authorized representatives must be involved. Cardano will completely step in the Voltaire era. laying the foundation and off-chain for a blockchain to maintain and pave the way for the industry. Our annual member meeting (AMM)- the first annual member meeting of Intersect will take place in October 2024. AMM is the obligation of Intersect as an organization based on members. This year will be our first AMM and we plan to hold a memorable event. The opening event is expected to take place in Japan - a country with a strong and long -standing participation of the cardano community - with an online participation option. Members will have the opportunity to review the performance of Intersect so far and will also have the opportunity to review the Cardano budget to pay cardano Continity. members can participate in seminars and events that mention the development of the previous year and consider Intersects 2025 plans for approval. There will be many more things about this. So see this field!. Constitutional Conference- Constitutional Conference will take place at Buenos Aires. where the selected delegates of the Global Constitutional Constitution will summon to approve the final version of the Constitution before direct approval. The cooperation process for this decision aims to not only affect the orbit of Cardano but also a typical example of the actual enforcement of decentralized management by agreeing on Cardanos constitutional content.',\n",
       " ' We will continue to update the roadmap when events and time are added or changed. So pay attention to track updated information. The continuity was first set in 2023 to show the technical work needed to maintain the operating Cardano Blockchain infrastructure. including the necessary upgrades and development. At InterSect. through the handover function. we have made a joint plan between seven suppliers to provide the elements of the continuity of 2024. These seven suppliers are providing many familiar products and work of development with the community because they include 1694 governance technology. improvement in storage of ledbook memory and other suppliers. Intersect will create the first cardano product cardano Product Backlog to identify these items continuously and share this with the community to get feedback. the continuous calculation will be determined through the process of a priority job list and funded by the Cardano fund with the consensus mechanism of the community. Intersect will act as a coordinating agency. the work is currently starting with a start -up seminar in London - managed by the Intersect Constitution Committee - to talk about how to manage the list of priority work cardano. So wait for more about it early and detailed information about how you can get relevant. After announcing the committee members in our knowledge base last week. the next updates were implemented:. the knowledge base of InterSect will continue to develop and expand. provide the latest results and proposals to all operating committees. In accordance with the dedication of Intersect in decision -making decisions. we invite the community to make a strategy led by a member to evaluate future sponsorship proposals. We want to set up a working group including community members who are willing to participate in the proposal. approve important milestones and select future items. The profound understanding from this group will notify the Steering Committee for the last approval. If you want to participate in this initiative. please register by filling out the form of the work group registration form. we are happy to announce that the WWG (WWG) group has announced that the first result of their first initiative was transferred to CPS-10 | Warehouse connection. The mission of WWG is to continue developing Cardano wallet ecosystem by providing a place for parties involved in a deep understanding of wallet and efforts to solve current and future issues. You can read more about this group here. including how to register. Wedeliver has started successfully his work for the Discussion Discussion Forum. The forum will be the place to socialize proposals for consideration and feedback before it can lead to administrative actions. We will update to you when they progress! After carefully evaluating. we are also happy to announce the Bloxico as the priority candidate for the Constitutional and Lidonation Portal for the DREP campaign platform. waiting for the contract agreement. Those who win in training and multimedia will soon be announced. So pay attention to follow up to get more update information soon. IOG has released Plutus V3 into the Sanchonet testing environment.',\n",
       " ' Plutus V3 enhances Plutus Cores encryption. allows Cardano to comply with industry standards. The process of combining updates in Sanchonet requires a reservation of testnet and some time to stop working. occurring at the time of the consensus mechanism of TestNet users. You can read more about Sanchonet here. Govtool - In the process of reset Sanchonet. Govtool could not access it. Our product group is currently upgrading Sanchonet Govtool to combine the latest node update with the latest DB synchronization version. Sanchonet Govtool will reopen the new test next week. And that is the content of this weeks update. When the creative engine continues to rotate. we want you to join. If you want to participate in any of these subjects. Introducing the first week update of the first Intersect development!. The InterSect group will present the latest developments and progress to members per week. including the updates of the committee. highlights of members. Lets take a look at what happened last week. The Meeting of the Board of Directors of InterSect - In 2024. the Board of Directors will summon every month. The Intersect Council held a second meeting on January 31. referring to many topics mentioned in the internal conference of the Intersect group. A new community advisory agency was established - in the first meeting earlier this week. a president and secretary was nominated to drive the group. One of the main tasks of this new group will be the design of a fair. transparent and global process to vote for community members to the Intersect Council later this year. the group will nominate an observer for the meetings of the Board of Directors and elected a member of the Provisional Council for six months and develop the process of voting members of the Board of Directors every year. It is expected that the nomination and election of two additional members will end at the annual member Congress in October this year. More than 50 funding applications - reactions to develop tools and documents to support Cardano Administration are huge. More than 50 applications for funding from members are currently considered with more funding opportunities. Read more about sponsorship. Update the Commission - a new part has been added to the knowledge basis of Intersect more detailed about current executive committees and their role supports core business functions at InterSect. You can visit the committee here. The Open Source Committee (OSC) promulgates its first policy - a new policy on open source administration to provide the best practical methods that projects can be used to organize themselves while maintaining the transferred roadmap to the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) when needed. It is also designed to create favorable conditions for smooth communication lines between those who contribute to open source projects and those who maintain them. A pilot pilot test will be conducted with a network group to find a place to improve before the policy is implemented. You can read about the policy here. you can see the OSC knowledge basis for everything about OSC.',\n",
       " ' The poll of the management group - the Board of Management Parameters conducted a survey to collect feedback on the initial management settings (see CIP -169400). The poll ends at 21:45 (UTC) on February 9. If you have missed this opportunity. there will be other opportunities when this integrated working team offers proposals on management settings that Cardano will apply on the next upgrade. Restructuring Monorepo Sanchonet Govtool - when we proceed to deploy CIP -1694. there was also progress in the management tool. In the recent Govtool storage restructuring. the Govtool group has prepared it for open source. ensuring access and easy use. Sanchonet Govtool allows Ada owners to experience some management features described in CIP-1694 when in the Sanchonet TestNet environment. Govtool has witnessed the number of visitors/users increasing steadily since its launch at the end of 2023. Govtool has a total of 589 visitors. an increase of 47% compared to the previous week. this increase also means increasing proposals and voting on the platform. If you want to take part in testing the management features from CIP-1694. follow this link. There is a lot of work behind. So remember to follow the update next week!. we always want to hear from you on any important topic for you around Cardano Administration. ideas or suggestions. please contact via email. twitter or LinkedIn.February 15. Charles Hoskinson sent an important message about the situation of the crypto industry and existing threats. He talked about Bitcoin ETF. Stablecoin. how much power managed organizations have for blockchains. Will Crypto eat meat of traditional financial industry (old financial system)? Is there any other way? Does the traditional financial industry eat meat Crypto? Is a decentralized or speculative winning? The topics that Charles raised resonated with our perspective on the crypto industry. Think about this topic. especially Bitcoin. is expected to replace the Fiat currency. But that does not happen. Stablecoin accounts for only 10% of the market capitalization of all types of crypto. about 70% of all transactions on Blockchain are related to Stablecoin. Stablecoins are supported in USD with USDT and USDC. The vast majority of people holding crypto through about 10 organizations are managed. Ordinary people on centralized exchanges. Organizations use a number of supervisors. About 500 million people hold crypto. It is estimated that only 2% of Crypto holders use hardware wallets (10 million). Only about 5% of people hold property in their wallets (25 million). While large centralized exchanges report the number of users increased to tens of millions each year. only about 45 million Bitcoin addresses hold BTC. Most people with wallets keep BTC at many addresses. I estimate that only about 4-10 million people hold autonomy. This corresponds to the number of HW wallets sold. The result of the approved Bitcoin ETF is that some managed organizations can hold a significant amount of BTC money in a short time. They have the right to decide which string will be the right series during the FORK process. Charles gave an example.',\n",
       " ' Organizations will make the choice of holding BTC A and BTC B after the FORK. They will determine which token to keep and which tokens will be sold to the market. If they choose to keep BTC B. BTC A will start losing market prices quickly. How will the miners react to this? Economic incentives will make them exploit BTC B because they will receive more rewards. The exchanges also have the right to make strong decisions about which Fork BTC they think is appropriate. organizations take control of infrastructure. People do not seem to care about keeping control. People will not have to hold crypto property on the exchange. thus weakening their position. no protection measures against the organizations buying tokens. people even welcome it. this organization holds a significant amount of stocks in all large mining companies. Two groups of Bitcoin dominated more than 50% of the blocks. They just like to work with the major miners they ask KYC. Exploiting BTC is a widely managed business. Most DEFI users prefer Stablecoin to be supported in USD for USDT and USDC more than algorithms. Tether and Circle companies are risks for DEFI. If these companies collapse and Stablecoin lost its stable value. many DEFI services could collapse. If the regulatory agencies require KYC/AML for all users of these stablecoins. this may affect DEFI services. In the case of Fork Ethereum. Tether and Circle companies can decide which string is true. After FORK. there will be stablecoin on both A and B chain. but one of them will hold the latch while the other will disappear. Both groups and communities have no control over the chain will be prioritized. They will be forced to adapt for economic reasons. Who eat meat?. Most transactions are related to Stablecoin. Most tokens are held by about 10 managed organizations. Exploiting BTC is a managed business. In the case of Fork Bitcoin. ETF providers will determine what is the real Bitcoin. Stablecoin publishers supported in USD will decide something similar in the case of Fork Ethereum. We can say that both prominent projects are corroded by traditional financial industry. Bitcoin is not a threat to banks but an opportunity to make money from transaction fees. Bitcoin ETF is a way to gain control of infrastructure and pool. Some organizations have decided to allow developers. basically their loyalty bribes. Ethereum is not a threat to banking services because the acceptance rate is very low. You can argue that it is a script that is too dark and eventually people will decide the right path. It is not like that. People behave like sheep and yearn for profits. They dont care about anything else. Honor and glory for those who prefer decentralization than their profits. Charles name the reasons for the current situation. The increasing numbers are the only thing people are interested in Crypto. Everything else is secondary. People consider Crypto as an investment. Most influential people are technical analytical magicians promising high profits in the future.',\n",
       " ' Many of them talk about projects they have paid the most money or have invested themselves. Crypto analysis and communication companies are mostly active as those of influential. No one cares about the principle and vision of Satoshi. Money promotes media images about the context of crypto. TPS. TVL. charts. airdrop and farming are more important than decentralization and technological progress. To expect profits. people ignore issues. Blockchain projects have many problems that hinder the application. It is decreasing decline. high and unpredictable. unsuccessful transactions. restarting blockchain. administration locks. many hacks in DEFI. exhausted wallet. reluctant to use self -management wallet. The traditional financial world is eating Crypto and most people welcome it. Charles was right to think that market capitalization was the biggest evidence for the success of most people. Why should people doubt the decentralization of Bitcoin when the highest market capitalization is the clear evidence of the best technology existing? Why should people doubt the large number of hacks in the Ethereum. Lido ecosystem and failed transactions when it has the highest TVL? Why doubt Solanas decentralization and restart ability when it has the highest TPS?. Why do people hold BTC on exchanges and not even draw lessons from the collapse of FTX? One of the reasons is that the 1 -waste of layer is high and the payment is slow when the bitcoin network is clogged. This happens in a price market (also due to the enthusiasm around Ordinals and BRC-20). People are not ready to pay tens of dollars for a transaction that the settlement may take many days. If the goal is to sell BTC in time. leaving money on the exchange will be more beneficial. This behavior is not only harmful to the use of Lightning Network but also DEFI in case of smart contract platform. Crypto industry has not yet provided solutions to this phenomenon. Many people expect that the incidents of the trading floors will teach people to use the right to self -management. but this has not happened. We must name the problems and solve them. Low expansion is one of these issues. The Bitcoin community expects people to get used to high fees and are willing to pay them. It is time to recognize it as a false story. We will find many similar false stories. If we have waited hopelessly to be applied more for more than a decade. then there would be something wrong. Something needs to change. People chose the profit path and did not care about decentralization. principles and inheritance efforts to control crypto. This behavior is reasonable. but should not prevent efforts to comply with the principles and build decentralized technologies. Stablecoins hobby shows how people understand decentralized. People like Stablecoin supported in USD although they require third parties to be managed to keep USD in a bank account. USDC and USDT can only be cast if there is basic property of the same value. This is not necessarily a legal currency in a ratio of 1: 1 but also other financial assets.',\n",
       " ' People like the solution that requires third parties. the supervisor is managed. although it can create a stablecoin according to algorithm without a third party. An algorithm Stablecoin uses a volatile crypto as a supportive asset and money (and burning) a stablecoin -based stablecoin at a certain safety rate. This solution works completely decentralized and only requires reliable Oracle service. There is no focus on this process that can fraud or bankruptcy in some way. The crypto industry is basically trying to replace the intermediary with a source code. I remember people often say Dont believe. verify. What has changed makes people want to trust Tether and Circle instead of a smart contract that can be audited and tested in combat?. Cardano needs Stablecoin to be supported by USD for the next price increase market. Cardano does not depend on them. Everyone should prioritize stablecoins with algorithms that will be verified over time. This may take several years. And we need a more focused form in the early stages. Djed works well and survived the market price. For a certain period of time. it is not possible to create new tokens. but this is consistent with the expected activities of the protocol. Do not expect people to start paying with the volatile token they consider to be an investment. we find that people need much more stability to use crypto assets as a means of exchange. Payment with crypto assets helps you earn 10 times in the growth market that can only be considered a way to realize profits. This is not a means of exchange but you are willing to spend anytime. The use of Stablecoin clearly shows the direction we need to go. Human behavior is unclear. Please respect the needs. Take advantage of this opportunity to enhance acceptance. The biggest obstacle to the application of blockchain technology is the thought and expectation of everyone. I dont know how to change it. people will cheer and enthusiastically take profit. Definition of Ethereum ETF approval will activate ETH demand. Everyone will shop like crazy. As soon as Bitcoins market price becomes so great that the growth rate slows significantly. organizations will start speculators into other assets. Organizations will not hold something that does not develop when they can pump something similar to develop. It is innocent to think that organizations will pump one property and not pay attention to the other property. Greed is endless. The joy of increasing wealth is understandable. Crypto is needed to be considered as speculative and begins to see the benefits of decentralization. Most users are not necessarily able to hold the fluctuating tokens. They only need to use Stablecoin and Defi. which will give them a stable economic environment with the benefits of decentralization. It is important to train and try to find places where decentralization is meaningful. Such places can increase by efforts to weaken the position of dominant entities. whether they are IT giants. organizations or even countries. Coming to Crypto to speculate is fair and reasonable.',\n",
       " ' but people have to stay because of decentralization and principles. Speculators must become users and supporters. The outstanding applications of Crypto are Stablecoin and DEFI. The final algorithm Stablecoin will replace stablecoins supported by USD. DEFI must be mature and similar to the banking services as possible from the users point of view. The only difference must be decentralized. Regarding fees. security and mainly financial stability must be the same. Blockchain can bring to the world more things rather than only Hodl tokens. This industry can bring the worlds reliable class world. Alternative banking services are one of the possible usage. Cardano should follow this path and do not subdue to false reports. It is meaningless to catch up with other projects in a certain field because Cardano is built on the right principles. We must follow the principles even though we will see Cardano ETF someday. There are no crypto assets. including cardano. have the opportunity to immune to speculators. No problem. Accept it and continue to build. Find a way to keep infrastructure decentralized in any case. Cardano (ADA) is the first class smart contract network Proof-of-Stake (POS) launched in 2017. Cardano aims to provide security. expansion and sustainability for non-decentralized applications and systems built on Blockchain. In addition to the community of developers. Node operators and projects. Cardano is also supported by many organizations: Input Output Global (IOG). MLAS They work together to support the development. application and finance of the network while Cardano towards the Voltaire era. Cardano has made a unique development approach when compared to other smart contract networks. The Ouroboros consensus model allows authorized shares. an unpaid output output accounting model (EUTXO) to allow the original token transfer. expansion and decentralization. and smart contracts were activated by HardFork Alonzo by 2021. With a dedicated user community and developer. Cardano has proven its endurance. Hau Alonzo. Cardano began to compete in more traditional crypto markets. such as DEFI and NFT. For full basic information about Cardano. please refer to our insurance starting report. ADAs price increased by 127. 2% quarterly. far exceeding the increase of 53. 8% of the crypto market in general. The increase in the fourth quarter brought the change compared to the same period last year ADA to 145. 2%. ADA is the original property of Cardano. It has three main use cases: (1) Solving network fees. (2) used to register Stake Pool to participate in the network consensus mechanism as Pool and (3) Stake as Pool Operation or authorized person to help keep the network security and earn a token reward. In November. SEC once again accused ADA as securities - along with other assets including SOL. Atom and Near - in the case of Kraken. Unlike the previous SEC cases in 2023. this case does not cause significant price fluctuations in ADA. Transaction fee (USD) increased by 66. 7% quarter. all not due to ADAs price action. because the transaction fee (ADA) also increased: 10. 6% compared to the previous quarter.',\n",
       " ' Cardanos budget balance increased by 2. 6% in a quarter to 1. 43 billion ADA. The increase of 40 million ADA is generally suitable for growth from the previous quarters. 20% of all transactions will be transferred to the budget. this clause can be changed through management if necessary. The nominal stake yield on Cardano is usually 3. 3% for ADA authorities. although it may vary depending on Stake Pool. Actual yields are calculated by nominal yields. except for inflation. taking into account any value dilution due to inflation. In Q4. the real yield is -0. 02%. ADA\\\\s supply is limited to 45 billion. but the active supply will undergo inflation until it reaches that limit. In each epoch. 3% of ADA reserve (ie ADA is not circulated) is distributed as a reward of Spos (SPO). This inflation tends to go to 0 when the reserve is exhausted and the circulation supply reaches 45 billion. Each online transaction comes with processing fees and storage costs. The fee is calculated by the minimum payable fee in addition to the size of the transaction. The average transaction fee (USD) increased by 50. 4% quarterly from 0. 10 USD to 0. 15 USD. the average transaction fee (ADA) does not change according to the quarter. The difference showing that ADAs price action is almost entirely due to the price increase in the dollar. Cardanos daily trading increased by 10. 9% quarterly. far exceeding the growth of 1. 6% quarterly of the daily operating addresses. The transaction rate on operating addresses has increased steadily in the past year. showing that proficient users have increased. The transaction rate/operating address Q4 is 1. 60 increasing by 9. 2% quarter and 45. 0% annually. The average activity per user increases may be the result of all newly launched and developed protocols in 2023 - namely DEFI protocols. These will be further discovered in the ecosystem analysis. The number of stake pool (creating more than one block) does not change. down 0. 6% quarterly. the number of entrusters has increased by 1. 6% in a quarter. these consensus figures have not changed significantly in Q4. Stake Pool is run by many different entities. such as individuals (public or anonymous) or organizations (originated from crypto or other organizations). Regardless of the entity in charge. many Spo (SPO) operates some pool groups due to current incentives limit to the maximum size of the group. In addition to multi -pool operators. there are 1.982 single spo (1.804 single pool operators and 178 multi -pool operators) in the fourth quarter. In October. Cardano Foundation posted a forum post to make changes in its authorization strategy. In addition to authorizing single pool operators. Cardano Foundation also authorizes multi -pool operators. supporting the largest community of ecosystem developers. Distribution of shares and historical authorities have not balanced on the total number of groups. Of the total 22. 8 billion ADA was stake in the fourth quarter. 186 the top groups (6. 0% of pool) accounted for more than 50%.',\n",
       " ' The beta feature in the Lace wallet allows Stake Ada users in the 4th quarter of 2023. which will help the authorized person more flexible in distributing their shares. Although technically. the top 186 pools will create a minimum attack vector (MAV). but in reality there is only 49 entities. because many top pools are operated by multi -pool operators. Another decentralized measure. Nakamoto coefficient. ended quarterly at 31. Although 49 (MAV) and 31 (Nakamoto coefficient) are low numbers compared to the total number of pools and authorities. they are significantly higher than many other networks. The decentralized index of Edinburgh (EDI) offers another framework to measure decentralization. The shares operate unchanged in the second quarter. 5% in the quarter to 22. The similar number of shares in the second half of 2023. the percentage of active shares and the ownership rate of participation have decreased by 10. 2% and 9. 6% compared to the same period last year. Mithril released the Beta version on the main internet and created the first Snapshot. more than 100 Stake Pool has joined the network to sign the Mithril certificate. Mithril is a multi -signature program to help expand the Cardano network. It provides a light. effective experience and safe alternative to users and applications to access all or part of the chain status. Its users do not require access to the entire string but they receive the same level of reliability. Cardanos network becomes more efficient. more reasonable and can support more applications and cases of use. Mithril will activate applications like. By the end of the 4. 2023 quarter. there were 96 SPOs participating as the Mithril signed. the total number of shares was 1. 79 billion ADA. Improvements for the download and extract process have reduced the boot time for the Node Cardano to less than 20 minutes on the laptop for consumers. Mithril is both a new password diagram and a network of signed nodes deployed with Cardano network. Mithril signals are light processes operated by SPO. together with block manufacturers that create a share -based signature sent to syntheticists. Mithril customers can download and verify the Snapshot certified from the so -called collection without trust. They can then use those snapshots to solve the synchronization of the chain. start the status and authenticate the chain. Sanchonet was released in the third quarter in the previous release of Node V8. marking an important milestone for Onchain Administration. Sanchonet is a testing network for Cardanos onchain administration. as determined according to the CIP-1694 instructions and is the core initiative of the Voltaire route phase. Users can interact with Sanchonet through NUFI and Lace wallets. and at the same time there is a session of administration discussion which is being developed positively. Voltaire will take the final steps towards sustainable ability through mechanisms and online and offline voting organizations. including members based on members. intersect. the community will be able to identify parameter changes. deploy hardfork/upgrade and transfer responsibilities from IOG.',\n",
       " ' Cardano Foundation and Emurgo - organizations that combine all seven management courses (genesis). Voltaire will also allow the withdrawal of funds to finance Cardanos continuous development through the vote of the community. The necessary infrastructure for a successful online voting platform has not exist. To meet this demand. Sanchonet acts as a sand box to test and build not only processes but also tools. Developers can use testnet to launch new infrastructure (for example. wallet and Explorer). SPO can check the vote/proposal to find weaknesses and new user roles - representative representatives (Dreps) - can be minced. Sanchonet is protected by Intersect - an organization based on members of the Cardano ecosystem - along with other community members. spo and pool. Intersect debuted with the purpose of connecting ADA holders together for a common vision to create a more transparent and creative Cardano ecosystem. Intersect is closely linked with Voltaire and the coordination from the bottom to further concentration. Cardano ecosystem witnessed a strong growth in Q4:. Although TVL is a measure to measure the ecosystem. it is not the only measure. Many DAPPS and services will not make a significant contribution to TVL in the way that the lending protocol can do. For example: IAGON - A decentralized storage solution - will not be TVL drivers because this is the infrastructure. Even in the DEFI. general tools such as Dexhunter and non -supervision platforms like AXO do not contribute directly to TVL. The daily average DApps transactions are not constantly changing quarterly. 8%. DAPPS transactions increased 38. 8% over the same period last year. The increase compared to the same period last year was mainly due to increased DEFI activity. due to the slow operation of the NFT market. Minswap and Liqwid Finance are two of many protocols with significant growth in 2023:. TVL (USD) increased by 166. 0% in the quarter. establishing the highest level of all time was US $ 449 million on December 14. The huge fourth quarter contributed to an increase of 693. 4% by year. Cardanos TVL ranking among all networks increased from 15th to the 11th position in the fourth quarter (starting from 34th place at the beginning of the year). TVL (ADA) also set the highest level of all time in the fourth quarter. reaching a peak of just over 700 million ADA. In early 2023. Cardanos TVL growth was driven by the introduction of new stablecoins: IUSD and DJED. Stablecoin continues to be a good indicator for DEFI health in the fourth quarter when the total stablecoin value is locked up 36. 8% to 21. Compared to other networks. Cardanos Stablecoin market has increased from 54th place to 32nd place in 2023. Stable assets are an ideal place to combine in liquidity. loans and loans. leverage and help escape rapid fluctuations - all quite popular in the crypto market. Like IUSD and DJED. Mehens Stablecoin USDM can produce the same effect when launching in the first quarter of 2024. Different users like different architectures and USDM will be the first type on Cardano.',\n",
       " ' Unlike IUSD and DJED. Mehens USDM is not algorithm or synthesis; It is a ratio of 1: 1 to be completely supported in US dollars. Indigos IUSD has inconsistent fixed rates. one thing that cannot happen with a 1: 1 support ratio and more accessible converts to create a price difference opportunity. Wanchain - a blockchain layer 1 POS EVM and a decentralized blockchain interactive solution - provided USDT and USDC on Cardano through its different bridges. Wanchain bridges are confidential by Wanchain authentication. Cardano connection with Wanchain. Bridge versions of Bitcoin and USDT/USDC (the largest stablecoins calculated by market capitalization in all types of crypto) have created a large liquidity opportunity for Cardano Defi. Smart tokens such as CIP-68 or CPS-0003 can open up opportunities for compliance with integration. allowing USDC to also available on Cardano. Another type of stablecoin originating from Cardano is about to debut is the USDA of Anzens. Most TVL growth in 2023 was driven by newer protocols. Indigo asset issuance company is the oldest and largest protocol among these new protocols (launched in about a year). It overthrew Minswap in the fourth quarter. ending the mines of Minswaps years as the leader of TVL. This change is not the result of the decline of minswap. MINSWAPs TVL has increased by 124% quarterly. Indigo simply surpassed the minswap with a growth of 165% TVL. Indigo and Minswap ended in the fourth quarter with TVL of 97. 5 million USD and 89. 6 million. The development of TVL and DEFI ecosystems comes with increasing difficulties. especially for DEX. Cardanos new Eutxo mechanism carries new DEFI models. such as Batching and trading chains. Many DEX is exploring new or improved solutions. such as Muesliswap operating on-chain transactions. The chain of transactions. which has been deployed on protocols like Optim. will be an improvement compared to the controversial process of Muesliswap. The partner chain is a broad term that can include technical sidechaine or modular networks. One of these partners is Midnight. a string that focuses on the upcoming data protection for Cardano. By taking advantage of Zero-Knowledge password. Midnight sets a goal to connect DEFIs principles to Tradfi requirements. It will allow users to disclose selective data while meeting the legal needs. Unlike Milkomeda. Midnight will have its own token: Dust. In q4. some features and cases of Midnights use have been announced. From the developers experience perspective. Midnight will use the language designed to integrate with TypeScript and built on the substrate- a developed framework popularly by Polkadot. This is not the first synthetic power between the two ecosystems. as Polkadots consensus mechanism is based on Ouroboros. Devnet originally attracted more than 600 development groups since its launch in November 2023. Midnight use cases include identity verification. controlled access to encrypted digital assets. AI and advanced LLM. decentralized credit scoring. decentralized voting. Cardano has some other sidechain - some are being produced and some are still developing. These networks include Milkomeda C1. Wanchain. Midnight and World Mobile.',\n",
       " ' Milkomeda C1 was launched in early 2022 as Cardanos first sidechain. Initially it brought EVM compatibility to the Cardano ecosystem. but in early September. it had EVM compatibility directly to Cardano wallet. Milkomeda C1 is mainly maintained by DCSpark. Most of Milkomedas activity takes place in the form of a game built with Paima Engine - a framework for general versions focusing on creating onchain and autonomous world games. Unlike all other current synthesis (including Ethereum synthesis using centralized arrangement). the synthesis built by Paima are real aggregates with decentralized sequence/proof. like Fuel V1. NFT activity decreased comprehensively in the fourth quarter. Transactions and trading volumes decreased by 8. 0% and 33. 8% respectively. The condition of Cardano NFT is even worse on the annual scale. with the number of transactions and trading volume decreased by 58. 3% and 68. 3% respectively over the same period last year. The only number of sellers is the only index increased by 2023. with an increase of 213. 2% over the same period last year to an average of 270 the only seller per day. Despite the decline in data. developers continue to innovate. For example: Tianmonds group encoded a diamond and put it in a string. using NFT as an on-chain representative. Property in the real world is an increasing trend on many different networks and even tokens can be replaced and irreplaceable have applications for these tokens. Other NFT improvements are about to appear in the form of books and games. respectively from Book. io and Paima Engine projects. In the fourth quarter. Hydra V0. Hydra is a group of large -scale expansion protocols. mainly layer 2 based on state channels. Hydra Head. the first solution in this set. is a mini offchain ledger. It works between a small group of people involved. just like other common channels like Lightning. Hydra takes advantage of the EUTXO model to transmit data more effectively and flexibly from layer 1 to layer 2 and vice versa. allowing the transmission of isothermal data. Hydra for Payments is an open source toolkit to implement payment solutions that will promote Hydra Head. The first head on the Cardano main network. also known as the channel. was opened in a limited form in March 2023. According to the text. the protocol can be considered in the public beta version. Until the protocol is checked more thoroughly. the number of ADA pledges will be limited to the safety of the user. Different developers from multi -pool are actively trying to improve Hydra Head. Initial applications include gaming. auction and P2P payment. At Summit Cardano. advanced classes have guided developers on how to use hydra for Dapps and how it can work with Mithril. Hydra Head is a flexible protocol with some proposed linked structures. Voting for Catalyst Fund11 began on January 24. Project Catalyst is a decentralized fund for innovation projects in Cardano ecosystem. In this fund. the owner of ADA decided which proposal would receive funding from the ADA budget.',\n",
       " ' Through all 10 capital levels. Catalyst has sponsored 1.344 proposals. the most recent fund. ended in September 2023 with 192 proposals sponsored. DCSpark is the most funded group with a sponsorship of 6. 26 million ADA (US $ 1. 6 million); Its most funded suggestions are related to Paima Engine. The participation and sale of votes (i. pay for other users for their votes) are two centralized centralized points that affect most groups and initiatives. The community has continued to explore different ways to improve its management process. They include evaluating proposals. verifying that sponsored projects have achieved important milestones. capital allocation. enhanced participation. identifying priority for ecosystems and officially transforming votes. During the two -week vote. Catalyst Fund10 received less than 410. an increase of more than 45.000 votes compared to the previous fund. This increase has raised the total transparent votes of Catalysts existence to more than 2 million. Fund10 witnessed 60.000 wallets registered with a total votes of 4. only 7.900 of those wallets actually voted to confirm a proposal - 50% of them only voted for 10 or less of the total of more than 1.000 proposals. The participation rate is relatively low (in terms of both users and ADA) causing some community members to propose different models and incentives. Due to linearly based on the token of Project Catalyst (ie 1 token with 1 vote). 5% of the top wallet controls 56% of the voting right. Some certain voting plans. beliefs and based on reputation. may be worth exploring to distribute better voting rights. The voter of the Fund10 has approved the open source Catalyst development roadmap to introduce flexible democracy for voting. According to this system. voting rights may be authorized for representatives called Dreps to vote on behalf of the ADA owner. This allows SPOS and other ada authorized individuals or pools to play a greater role in influencing which proposals receive funding. Other plans. such as three -dimensional photos. can counterproductive effects in resolving voting votes - if the community considers it a problem rather than an opportunity for both profits and enhance transparency. Optim Finance has officially turned the vote in Fund10 with his liquidity bond - a means to authorize the loan and lending ADA and speak broadly as voting rights. Optims model allows borrowers to pay for additional voting rights from the lender. users can pay a relatively small premium to borrow votes in a single era for catalysts proposals. Because the vote of votes has taken place. turning it into a transparent process will only enhance the management in the long run. The Cardano address has its own courses for payment and stake. allowing Stake to liquidity. users can send ADA on the protocols (ie the protocol contract with the payment key) without having to give up the control of shares. This process is handled differently by different protocols:. Q4 ends a year of strong growth of the ecosystem. TVL (USD) and Stablecoin are locked by 166% and 37% respectively.',\n",
       " ' This skyrocketing liquidity brought Cardanos TVL ranking from 34th to 11th transparency. This growth is observed on the protocols established as the Minswap. showing the leading transaction activity and new participating protocols such as Indigo. emerging as TVLs largest protocol in Q4. Cardanos infrastructure development process continues. On the Cardano main online. technologies such as Hydra and various DEFI projects sponsored by Project Catalyst have come to produce and introduce new use cases to protocol developers. In addition to the main network. the partner and sidech chain gives developers the opportunity to take advantage of diverse enforcement environments. The new liquidity and new infrastructure contribute to the growth of Cardano. It is important that the development of the ecosystem in 2023 takes place in parallel with decentralized initiatives stated in CIP-1694. Sanchonet and Mithril.

Plutus V3 is a large upgrade that will bring new capabilities to applications built on Cardano. it introduces new encryption principles including Zero-Knowledge (Zero-Knowledge). This will allow Zero-Knowledge Rollups and Zero-Knowledge smart contracts on Cardano. Hard-Fork Vasil. deployed in September 2022. brought to Plutus V2. V2 has a significant impact on the effectiveness of smart contracts. V3 once again brings higher efficiency but also has new capabilities. Plutus V3 is available for testing on Sanchonet. Plutus V3 includes advanced tools and jaws that help developers have more options to write smart contracts. The IOG group. cooperating with MLABS. focuses mainly on the performance. exhaust. scale of smart contracts and new capabilities. The encryption ability will be expanded. the upgrade of Valintine supported ECDSA and Schnorr. allowing the ability to interact with Bitcoin. V3 adds new encryption principles that allow the construction of Sidechain bridges and increase interaction with other blockchain. Perhaps the most expected thing is the support of the non -knowledge evidence system (ZKP). Zero-Knowledge coding will allow developers to build Zero-Knowledge Rollups and Zero-Knowledge smart contracts. This will bring Cardano closer to what Midnight can do (Midnight has the advantage of having a separate blockchain. Some groups have announced that we have a few months to have a smart contract Zero-Knowledge on Cardano.',\n",
       " ' The Plutus language contains the built -in functions commonly used in instructions. V3 brings new functions. 17 new jaws support the coding curves. It opens the door for seamless deployment and integration with Mithril. the KECCAK-256 password hash function produces 256 bit hash value. It is often used to verify safety data on Ethereum. And supporting it in Plutus will allow the construction of cross -chain solutions and support a number of community projects. V3 introduces BitWise jaws that allows developers to manipulate bits at a low level. This will have a positive impact on higher performance. developers will have a primitive that allows high efficiency conversion between integers and chains. CIP-58 adds a low-grade jaw for algorithms and highly effective data structure. The ability to build effective chopping boards. structure of general lock-mapping data. Hard-Fork Chang provides Cardano management. V3 will allow users to view entities related to CIP-1694 administration. This is Cardanos first major step in the management era. You can register as Drep on Sanchonet. This process is very easy and takes a few minutes. About 600 wallets participated in Sanchnet and more than 160 registered Dreps. Those are very good numbers for TestNet. According to Sanchonets roadmap. phase 1 to 4 was completed. This allows Drep. DREP authorization and DREP voting. it is also possible to vote in SPO or DREP. I hope the same thing can happen on the Cardano main online after the hard-Fork. V2 brings significant increase in effectiveness compared to V1. V3 surpasses the boundaries of efficiency and expands its ability. Some teams are looking forward to V3. Hopefully they will soon offer applications to make the most of the potential of V3. Hopefully we will soon see the use of zero-knowledge. A modern blockchain allows token casting. some layers 2. good -scale expansion (sharding). security solutions. It often talks about many chains linked together in an ecosystem. The crypto industry is entering the stage where the best ability to deploy existing technologies becomes important. Development groups need to think about security. efficiency and user experience. Bitcoin has a BRC-20 token standard. the community is talking about Stablecoin and DEX. Zero-Knowledge Rollups first via the recently introduced BitVM. Bitcoin is catching up and applying existing technologies from other projects. What is Cardano doing about this? This is somewhat similar to Apples strategy. Cardano has never been the first to market. but when launching a new product. the design is carefully considered and reliable. A number of Cardano copy projects and vice versa. Cardano applies technology from other projects. One of the aspects that can determine success will be the quality of deployment of available technologies. The days that the Bitcoin community considers unnecessary smart contracts and tokens probably gone. Some members of the Bitcoin community publicly talk about the fact that Stablecoin is necessary for developing countries. Some people are crazy about Ordinals & Inscribes. CEO of MicroStrategy wants to encrypt assets in the real world in Bitcoin. Applications compatible with EVM will be built on Zero-Knowledge Rollups.',\n",
       " ' The Bitcoin community reacts with Ethereums success. Blockchain and Layer 2 networks are used by many people to trade with Stablecoin. Increasingly clear that Defi will transform the financial world. Organizations will not only hold and trade crypto but also use Blockchain network. We can say that the direction set by Ethereum is appropriate. Bitcoin jumps in this orbit is the confirmation for what many people have known for many years. I expect that in the coming years. we will witness the efforts of the teams in implementing technology in the best way possible. The debate will not be about whether we need tokens or not. but any standards and the way to deploy which is effective. safe and most suitable for specific use cases. Let us consider briefly the standard layer 1 token standards because they form a platform for the DEFI. It is always said that Bitcoin can apply the best technology when the time is appropriate. This is happening. We can think about whether Bitcoin has the best standard token. The BRC-20 token standard is the standard token that uses Ordinals & Inscribes to allow casting and transferring tokens that can be replaced on Bitcoin blockchain. It uses JSON data to start the token contract. create new tokens and move around. Unlike Ethereum ERC-20. BRC-20 does not rely on smart contracts to operate. it uses a single identification code stated on Satoshi. This identification code. along with the data of the Ordinals. is inserted into part of the Bitcoin transaction called the Witness Signature field. This data verifies the legal ownership of the money being used and ensures that they are not spent twice. There is no ON-chain authentication like the way with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. To use BRC-20. use external protocols. These protocols help handle the complexity of the BRC-20 standard. such as managing the Ordinals words and ensuring the accurate operation of the token. the Bitcoin protocol does not know anything about tokens. although the JSON data is stored in the Blockchain. The BRC-20 standard is not suitable for DEFI and assets encryption. Ethereum is the first project to allow token to operate through smart contracts. Smart contract is a code in which the token publisher determines the behavior of the token. including the transfer of money. All tokens activities require on-chain authentication. It is not necessary to use any external protocol. ERC-20 is a significant standard for DEFI. Cardano has original property. Token publishers identify the basic characteristics of tokens through the caster. but do not identify details related to storage in ledger or bank transfer. Cardano protocol is responsible for switching tokens. Smart contracts (commands) are not used to transfer tokens. Cardano performs on-chain authentication. safer and more effective than Ethereum but less programming. We think our readers understand the difference between the tokens cast on Ethereum and Cardano. We have briefly described 3 different tokens standards to prove that the same ability can be implemented very different. Ethereum has the advantage of the leader.',\n",
       " ' The IOG group may consider the deployment of Ethereum and give another standard. The original assets are the same in that the on-chain authentication process. but they differ in terms of programming. IOG group prioritizes efficiency and security. Why does Bitcoin have such a bad token standard? Because this standard is not the job of a development group that thinks carefully about the design. but as many people present. it is the abuse of protocols. There is no consensus mechanism in the Bitcoin community about whether or not to follow the DEFI path. Bitcoin -based construction groups are forced to abuse available options. The Bitcoin Core group often objects to all changes that allow better technology deployment. it seems that the better token standards for Bitcoin will be created on Layer 2. It is unclear whether tokens on Bitcoin can compete with the effectiveness and security of the token on the smart contract platform. because Bitcoin Script is very limited. The third party groups are difficult to create anything on Bitcoin. All the final solutions ended with a number of concentrated or linked infrastructure types. It is important to note that if Bitcoins blocking time does not change and maintained at 10 minutes. it will damage the completion of the transaction of all layers 2. Pow of Bitcoin is complete with the probability of the block. plus more than 50% of the mass is exploited by 2 main pools. Layer 2 will be damaged by that related to complete and security. It seems that the group and community must agree on innovations and changes for the protocol. Some forms of on-chain management may be an important ability for the future of the protocol. If the Bitcoin group proactively resists changes to the protocol with the argument that the protocol is still as good as the present. it will promote the innovation to the second grade or forced third -party groups to abuse the protocol. the result is very effective solutions. Many projects. have followed the opposite path. They try to learn from the mistakes of other projects. to innovate and improve technology. This is done through the active or passive support of the community. If you are a fans of Cardano project. you probably will not expect the development will end in the Voltaire era. You expect the group to gradually improve the consensus mechanism (Stake is done in the Shelley era and the Basho era focuses on expansion) and smart contracts (Goguen era). As the competition between projects is increasing. there is no significant difference between what Blockchain provides. The quality and characteristics of personal features are becoming important. What we have shown on the token standards will be similar to smart contracts. the ability to expand. It will not matter how many DEXs that a certain ecosystem has. but how many of them will be hacked (security). speed and speed of swap. how many people can use simultaneously the platform (expansion ability). User experience depends on the quality of the implementation of each technology.',\n",
       " ' A ecosystem may not maintain the market dominance if it is no longer a leader in technology. With mass application. much higher requirements on efficiency and quick adaptability to new conditions will be set for projects. Success will depend on the scale and expertise of groups. financial resources for innovation and management form. Some consider Cardano as a slow project. They may be true to some extent. because Ethereum has token born earlier than Cardano. Solana is much better than Cardano. Polkadot and Cosmos with Blockchain for applications. Monero with private transactions. Cardano has never been the first person to launch any technology. This is similar to Apples strategy but not the intention of the development group. The NXT project has implemented the first POS consensus mechanism in 2013. The Tezos project features a Stake liquidity before Cardano in 2018. Cardano is not the first blockchain to deploy POS with a liquidity Stake feature. but this is the first project in the top 10 with it and it is still in the top 10. The number of Stake Ada people is constantly increasing so it can be said that this is a successful deployment. Cardano project is one of the few pioneer projects of the UTXO model. There are only 2 projects in the top 10 using this accounting model. The IOG group has improved the Bitcoin UTXO model and thus increases its expression and efficiency. All tokens on Cardano are UTXO and have the same characteristics as Coin ADA. Cardano is not the first project to have tokens. The IOG group has made the most of Bitcoin and Ethereum and creates their tokens with unique features. I dare to assert that the advantage of Cardanos original property will prove to be an advantage in the future due to its efficiency (less demand for computer resources during the transfer process). Many smart contract platforms are compatible with EVM. The IOG group has followed their own path. Plutus instructions are a combination of smart contracts Bitcoin Script and Solidity. Even in this case. it is a unique approach. The UTXO model and the Plutus command have allowed the AXO project to build a single DEX order book. Axo Dex is very saving resources and from the users point of view. it offers options that we have not yet been in crypto so far. Genius Yield is another great DEX that allows transparent and predictable transactions without any transient price sliding and loss. Cardano allows users to run BOT trading without monitoring through wallets. Even if the bot deals with ADA. the token is still stake and the stake reward will be transferred to the users address. The IOG group can bring existing technologies to a new level. This may be a strategy that brings the same victory as for Apple. Apple did not create the first smartphone and virtual reality glasses. but they always created the best version on the market after repeating. The IOG group took over Paritys substrate to build a partner series.',\n",
       " ' An important part of the code has been rewritten. So this will not be a copy of this concept. It is difficult to predict what the results will be. but based on history. we can estimate that it will be above average. This can be perceived in a way that the project can reflect the technological progress of other projects and adapt to it effectively. It will happen again after the competition has brought the same results. but Cardano may have a very high quality solution. We certainly dont want to say that Cardano is Apple of the Blockchain industry. This is a good similarity for the IOG technology approach. The goal is not to become the first person in the market or copy competitors. The goal is to think about design in the context of protocols and other technologies. Properties such as high decentralization. determination or the expected fee will be positively affecting everything on the protocol. Third -party applications depend on the consensus mechanism of the network. accounting model. plutus platform. token standard. layer 2. Future upgrades and application improvement are important for success. We can see that Plutus V2 applications are significantly more effective than Plutus V1. Plutus V3 is coming. there are some functions that are no longer important but continue to improve it. Like each new iPhone version better. individual blockchain technologies must also be improved. Each new version is not necessarily revolutionary. but the difference between 5 versions will be significant. Perhaps we should ask whether the existing technologies are really the best. It is possible that other development groups have been launched too early and they are currently facing issues such as many hacks. restarting the network. unable to expand the size of Layer 1 better. Blockchain technology is growing rapidly. although the application seems slower. Perhaps the blockchain industry is not ready to be applied and we will have to wait a few more years. I am almost sure one thing. Once the application occurs. technological progress will be faster than today. Development groups will gradually improve the protocols similar to the way IT giants improve their services. Sometimes something revolutionary appears to interrupt the entire industry. This may be a combination of blockchain with AI or technology that allows Crypto property transfer without blockchain. As the first person to bring new technology to the market is a great advantage. But that is not sure that the project has the best technology combination and will be the most successful project. We have witnessed many times in history that the first people to participate in the market have failed. We have also witnessed the slower launch technologies. It is difficult to predict the future. Apple is not the first and only company to sell smartphones. The US Wyoming state is preparing to release Stablecoin and is considered a multi -platform project. Cryptos future will not only have one winner. Cardano will be part of the future because it has unique features that make it different from others.',\n",
       " ' But mainly thanks to the group can provide quality technologies above average.February 9. the Solana network has been restarted after nearly 5 hours of operation. This is a long -term problem of this project that the development team cannot solve. Solana sometimes needs to restart the network. which requires the cooperation of all authentic people. It is important to realize that this is a security issue for blockchain. We do not want to become a freacher on the misfortune of others. it is important to understand why the IOG group uses scientific methods. formal methods and scientific evaluation to build Cardano. Blockchain is an important system and must run 24/7/365 without restarting. Not meeting this requirement is a risk to the users money. One of the motivations to pursue the movement of concentrated services to Blockchain is better recovery from the network stopped. The decentralization must ensure that after one or some nodes stop working in a short time. the services will still be available. Solana seems less trustworthy than conventional financial services. from the business point of view. Paypal moves a part of his service to a less reliable network than unreasonable. To ensure 100% of the service of services on Blockchain. some conditions must be met. The workstation must be reliable. And it does not contain serious errors. This can be achieved through software development carefully. The development team must be aware that they are developing an important system. Scientific research. formal methods and scientific evaluation are essential. this method is more expensive in money and time. If the development groups goal is to bring their blockchain to the market quickly. it is likely that the software will be at average. The variety of workstations is another way to significantly increase the durability of the network. Most blockchain today depends only on a ruling workstation. Other workstation application deployment absolutely does not exist or exist and are not used. The serious fault in the prevailing workstation is a risk factor for the networks reliable operation. there must be many implementation of workstation applications from independent groups and operators must use evenly of these workstation applications. If there are 4 workstations available and each workstation has 25% of the network representative. it is likely that if a workstation version is defective. 75% node in the network can still create blocks. Cardano and Solana have a completely different network consensus mechanism. Development groups approach software development are quite different. The difference in reality is that Solana requested to restart the network regularly while Cardano has been working non -stop for many years. Cardano has had a small stop working in the process of blocking blocks. The problem of stopping operating only lasts a few minutes and the network can recover without restarting the network or manual intervention of operators (SPO). The problem of stopping is evidence that the cardano workstation application is a powerful code and the group has thought of these crisis situations. If the network suddenly stops working.',\n",
       " ' not sure what will happen to the transactions that the user has sent immediately before stopping operation. financial losses may occur. users can pay goods and take them home. right after payment. the network stopped operating and these transactions may not be put into the blockchain after restarting. retailers may lose money. the development team will try to prevent this. So they will want to make sure that no transactions have been handled. this may not always be done. If the network stops working for hours. it may be a problem for DEFI services. Some financial contracts may expire and users cannot do anything because the network is not available. Blockchain -based DEFI applications run 24/7/365. Smart contracts automatically perform the exact activities they must perform in certain cases. If the action is required from the user does not happen in time. the smart contract will perform a certain operation without changing. The third party could not change to focus on some things after the network restarted. If DEFI services act as decentralized services. Blockchain must be 100%reliable. there may be injustice in the system. Users may not send transactions at an important time and the result may lose money. The group may intentionally manipulate transactions during the network stopped. This is a direct threat to the system security. It can be considered a third party intervention on the operation of the system. which will operate autonomy and make third party unable to change anything. If the blockchain stops working for hours. it will threaten the users money directly. I dont consider Solana a safe network. A decentralization will lose its meaning if the operators must know each other. use the same Discord and cooperate when restarting the network. the group forced them to use a new version of the workstation application that had not been tested and could contain malicious code. back door or other errors. Operators may not have time to handle details because the main goal is to quickly recover the network. operators should have time to run the new version of the workstation on the testing network and check it properly. But it may take a few days and Solana will have to stop during that time. This is unwanted from the users point of view. from the security point of view. it will be the right approach. do not restart the blockchain because this shows many problems. The goal of the crypto industry is to gain the trust of everyone. We all want them to entrust their assets to Blockchain technology. Blockchain network is an important system. Security is above all. The Solana group previously laughed at the IOG group when saying that Cardano was building too slowly and the scientific approach was not necessary. Time shows that the IOG group has chosen the best way possible to build Cardano while Solana is losing everyones confidence. For financial institutions. security is an important feature. They will study blockchain projects before using or investing in them.',\n",
       " ' vaneck wrote this about Solanas consent mechanism:. The core issue of this suspension incident and other past issues stems from Solanas running a test system. There is no official verification of the Solana consensus mechanism. nor can it predict the future errors in Solanas design due to the huge amount of data that the system processes. Although Solana has made many improvements to minimize past issues. Solanas design may make us unable to understand future complications until they occur. Some organizations are aware that the use of formal methods is essential to build a reliable blockchain network. some people ignore it or may not even know that the software can be built in different ways. Some groups of investors such as K33 or analytical companies like Messari will tell you the same thing as the Solana group about scientific approaches or formal methods. As a biased family. may be bribed and most likely not to understand software development. they affect the orthodox views and decide where the investors money will come. This deforms the market. because some people assess the quality of projects by market capitalization rather than technology. Wishing the Solana group solve the problem and not occasionally restart the network. But I dont believe they will succeed. They will have to start over again. scientifically verifying that Solanas consensus mechanism will be reliable and then use regular methods to deploy for workstations. This may take several years of development. It may be a good idea if you build a replacement workstation app this way. Some influential people tend to forgive Solanas stopped operating the network. saying that the development team is improving the technology capabilities of Blockchain. technological progress cannot restrict users in managing their money or even causing financial losses. This can happen in DEFI services if the blockchain does not run for a few hours. Solana is not the leader of Defi. so he hopes nothing is serious. Cardano seems to be a safe blockchain for your money and is a more suitable smart contract platform to build DEFI services. Unable to build reliable DEFI services on the Blockchain platform without trust. In the past. all blockchains have some problems. Satoshi had to save Bitcoin through a hardfork. The Ethereum group had to restore Blockchain due to the hack of knives. Ethereum authentication is sometimes stopped working. This does not cause serious problems like Solana. but it shows a problem. The fact is that Cardano is one of the few blockchains who have never needed to restart the network but need the coordination of the operator. have never stopped working for a long time during the production process and has never restored Blockchain. Cardano has a single workstation deployment. but this deployment is built at the request of an important system. The public does not have the opportunity to see the difference in the quality of the workstation application. but in reality. they can directly experience that through the stopping of network operations and other possible incidents.',\n",
       " ' this is very important. If Solana restarted many times. this project did not have the opportunity to succeed in the financial sector. Sooner or later there will be financial losses forcing people and organizations to abandon this project. Cardano may appear as a leader in technology if it maintains the state as the network does not require reboot. In order for technology to become popular and replace existing technology. it must be 10 times better for users. Crypto has the ambition to replace traditional financial services. But this will never happen if the transaction fails and users have to send them back. High fee and fluctuations for slow transactions. long payment do not have the opportunity to compete with payment cards or mobile bank applications. If these technologies do not work well. people will still use cash and go to the bank. Cardano behaves definitely. It is possible to build applications that the transaction will be Always-Success (always successful) if it is sent online. This must be a new standard for blockchain services. The majority of the population will not accept many problems like a few enthusiasts who have applied these technologies very early. Around 2017. Ethereum defined the standard for DEFI. The failure of the failure is normal. The fee is sometimes low. but mostly high. If Mem-Pool is full. people can wait for hours or even daily to solve. The worst experience of the user is that when they have to pay hundreds of dollars continuously for a failed transaction. This is the beginning of the DEFI era. DEFI today is still used by many people. But their quantity will not increase significantly if this is still the standard. It is necessary to improve the quality bar. Ethereum is the first smart contract platform. The groups goal is to provide a global computer for financial services. The group decided to use a account -based model different from the UTXO model used in Bitcoin. the group has applied a competitive fee market model from Bitcoin. They invented something called global sharing state. These design decisions (and other decisions) damage user experience. The model based on the Ethereum account is not decisive. The impact of a transaction on the ledger change is unpredictable because the capital accounts can be changed. Transferring value on Ethereum is to change the balance on the user account. The authentication of transactions depends on the balance of certain accounts. the balance may change at any time. This leads to unknown behavior. At the time of sending the transaction. there may be enough balance on a certain account. this may not happen when Ethereum tries to bring transactions into a new block. True transactions may fail. Accounts can be considered as a resource shared in the system. Each transaction may affect the state of any account in the system. The common nature of these accounts is one of the reasons why Ethereum and other similar blockchains are considered as a state blockchain. Ethereum transactions can be considered as a state.',\n",
       " ' The complete state of Ethereum describes the current state of all accounts and balances as well as all smart contracts deployed and runs in EVM. The current state may be changed by transactions. we want to focus more on users rather than technology. They will encounter failed transactions due to Ethereums design. The IOG team has the second advantage. It may have learned from its predecessors and chose another design for Cardano. The assertiveness. low fees can be predicted and other decisions make Cardano a platform with the same function as conventional financial services. Cardano is not ready to apply mass. it is necessary to improve the expansion of the first class. This is a problem for almost all blockchains including unexploded Ethereum. The IOG group realized that failed transactions could be an indispensable problem for mass application. They decided to design cardano to operate decisively. In the case of the UTXO model. a transaction can be considered as a function to consume one or more the first UTXO that produces one or more output UTXOs. Utxo participating in the transaction is not changed. Can ensure monopoly access even in the case of application (DEFI). Cardano does not need to handle accounts or overall status shared during authentication. Capital transactions have no state. The authentication of transactions basically depends only on the input UTXO. Local verification can be verified that input UTXO can be used by a transaction. The status conversion process can be locally verified without depending on any other overall state on-chain. If the transaction exceeds the local authentication at the time the user sends it. it is almost certain (but not 100%) that Cardano will put this transaction in one of the next blocks. If a large number of transactions fail in the network. the resources will be wasted (space in mem-pool. CPU. Blockchain network can expand low due to decentralization. The network must use resources as effective as possible. the verification of transactions will consume minimum resources and transactions will exceed authentication. A failed transaction will only cost resources. but there will be no financial activity. Those who are familiar with the current financial services will not start using Crypto and DEFI if that means having to pay high fees for unsuccessful transactions. Even if users do not have to pay for failures. they will never believe in a system that does not need to be trusted. the solution is not a low fee on networks with high TPS. The concentrated services have good scale. low fee or zero. quickly pay for domestic transactions and very high reliability. It will be very difficult for blockchains. including layer 2. to overcome this. The main current will not start using DEFI because of decentralization. It is naive when waiting until the service is concentrated or the money fails miserably. We do not wait for the identification money to disappear from the world due to high volatility and blockchain will still be the only alternative. People will always see errors if they have experience with a better system.',\n",
       " ' but we must build a decentralized solution. and other assets will be the same. if not better than the assets of the current financial system. It is necessary to take into account the current financial and money services will continue to exist and build such attractive DEFI services. Paying a high fee for a failed transaction is probably the worst combination from the users point of view. If they experience it. they may never return to this platform. If they only hear about it. they wont be motivated to try this platform. Developers as well as fans should change their minds. We may witness the slow decline of the financial world. The states and their money will be here for a while. The hobby of the main trend will determine which blockchain will be used the most in the future. The determination and the fee can be predicted as the features of the cardano that the user wants. Fans of competitive projects will not tell you. they do not have the opportunity to affect the reasonable behavior of those who will make decisions based on the efficient use of their resources. No one is rich enough to pay unnecessary transactions. The fee on Cardano may even be lower. but it is important to think about the long -term economic sustainability of the project. the current situation is often misunderstood. It is said that the platforms earn the most money from the fee are successful. if the high fee is due to low expansion. the fees and users have to pay many consecutive times for unsuccessful transactions. it is not a long -term sustainable model. People will stop using the platform as soon as something better appears. Grade 2 can solve this problem somewhat. but probably not completely. Another extreme is that the very low fee only has the opportunity to cover the network operating costs if each person on the planet performs 100 transactions a day. This can destroy the project token system.February 2. If you install Daedalus wallet on your computer. Node Cardano will be installed at the same time. The difference between Daedalus and lightweight wallets like Yoroi. Nami and many other wallets? We will explain the basic differences in the article. Each Blockchain wallet must be connected to a full node to interact with Blockchain. a user interface allows users to see how many coins they own and tokens. the wallet allows them to send transactions. the wallet is used to create a special transaction with the authorized ADA authorization certificate for the selected group. the data is stored in the blockchain and changes the status of the blockchain through transactions. All valid transactions will be put into the block. Each new block added to the blockchain will change the current state of the ledger. Users can run their nodes that are locally connected or his wallet can be connected to the remote node operated by others (third parties). When installing Daedalus wallets. Node Cardano will automatically be installed on local computers.',\n",
       " ' Daedalus is connected to node through communication between processes (IPC). When you open Daedalus. Node Cardano will also automatically start. When you close the wallet. Node Cardano will turn off. Having node on your computer means no need to trust in third parties. Through Daedalus. it is possible to interact directly with the Blockchain network. The so -called lightweight wallet connected to the remote Cardano node is operated by third parties. The first lightweight wallet in the Cardano ecosystem is Yoroi. connected to Node Cardano operated by Emurgo. Full node loads new blocks and authenticated them (including all transactions). These blocks are then added to the local version of the ledger. This means that operating a full node requires large enough memory. there are requirements for the ability to calculate and connect to the Internet well. If you run a full node for the first time. it must download the entire blockchain history from the peer -to -peer network nodes and verify it. This may take a few hours (or even a few days) depending on your ability to calculate and connect to the Internet. This process is often called synchronization. The node will gradually reach the point of knowing the whole history (all blocks) and may begin to authenticate the current blocks. If a full node runs permanently. it will add a new block to the blockchain every 20 seconds. The connected wallet can immediately provide users with updated information and allow them to send new transactions. This is how most mild wallets work because third parties always have node cardano running. Daedalus can do that. but only when you always open your wallet and never turn off the computer. This may be related to additional costs. Many users turn off the computer or close the wallet when not needed. Node Cardano will also stop working. This means there is no synchronization during this time. When the user opens Daedalus after a while. the synchronization process must first take place. Node Cardano must download and verify all new blocks from the last abbreviation. Only then will Daedalus wallet have updated data on the state of the blockchain. Node Cardano shuts for long since the final synchronization. the longer the synctative time will be. Some users occasionally open Daedalus even if they do not need wallets (after a few days) to synchronize. The desktop is increasingly used. Most people turn off their laptops (or switch to sleeping mode) at night. often to protect the environment. Especially young people use mobile phones and may not have a computer at home. To decentralize. this is a challenge we have to solve. If you want to interact without trust with Cardano network and dont want to trust anyone. you have to run a full node. The easiest path is Daedalus. you must have enough computer resources for a complete node and expect that the synchronization process will take place. Many users do not want to run a full node for many reasons. They prefer to use lighter wallets.',\n",
       " ' Lightweight wallet occupies almost no capacity on local disks. They immediately display the current data (money) and allow you to send transactions without waiting (no need to synchronize). Thousands of users can connect to a third party server at the same time. Your comfort depends on third -party investment in infrastructure. Lightweight wallets must know that connecting to Cardano network depends on third party. It should be noted that Node Cardano is installed with Daedalus wallet running in passive mode. This node does not cast new blocks. It only confirms new transactions through the blocks it receives. If you run Daedalus wallet on your laptop. you will maintain your ledger version. you do not help the network anything related to the creation. distribution of users trading or temporary storage them in mem-pool. Node Cardano is inactive need an additional protective layer. including installing 2 relay nodes. the nodes produce blocks (groups) hidden behind the relay node. This setup is complicated for many ordinary users and requires a certain infrastructure that home users often do not have. people should adhere to decentralized principles. The independence of a third party is one of them. That is why people should run their full node. although it is less realistic for most users. It is impossible to assume that people will buy another computer because of decentralization. SPO knows how to operate the nodes producing blocks reliably in the family environment or they can use Cloud services. History shows that users are not interested in running the full node. Only about 5% of users use their own management wallets. In the Bitcoin network. only 0. 002% of their full number of runner node. statistics are most likely the same (the number of relatively large nodes and the number of people holding the ADA smaller). the crypto industry is aiming for. Users must have a light workstation with the same security level as the full nodes. Mithril is one of the technologies that can lead us towards this goal. A decentralization is to eliminate weaknesses that can threaten network attributes. A single error point can even cause the entire system to stop working. There is no entity. whether in the form of a node or a human group. a significant position is significantly stronger than other entities. These entities can abuse their position or become an easy target for attackers. we will consider the hidden weaknesses of blockchain projects. A single point of Failure (SPOF) may be a node or a node group in the network that has a significantly stronger position than other nodes. The nodes are always run by humans so they can also be spof. you can see 4 nodes of block manufacturers (groups) operated by Alice. Carol and Dave. All produce 25% of the network in the network. They have equal status. Can attack nodes or people. a DDOS attack targets nodes (trying to remove that node from the service) while management agencies limit the decision making of node operators. The development group is also an important part of any blockchain project and can represent Spof to some extent.',\n",
       " ' The development team is responsible for providing workstations (software). The Bitcoin Core development group publishes new versions of the Bitcoin workstation app. The IOG group published new versions of Cardano workstation apps. If a workstation dominates the network. a hole in the source code of the workstation can cause the entire network to collapse. The workstation is also a spof with the group responsible for it. we will discuss the following products:. A attack may target the networks consensus mechanism. This may be an effort to censor transactions. create blanks or try to attack twice (the same token many times). This is an attack on nodes but it also affects the operators of nodes. Users may also be affected by the attack. Some attacks can target both node and operators at the same time. The operator can respond to the attack in some way. Users expect from a decentralized network that these attacks will not occur. The security of the system. depends on decentralization. The most famous attack online is called 51%attack. This is an offensive from the outside conducted by online competitors. Satoshi Nakamoto believes that countries will attack Bitcoin to prevent it. The 51% attack is aimed at the networks consensus mechanism. The fight against this attack is based on the assumption that it is so expensive that no one dares to try. The attacker must control all the expensive resources used in a certain network for decentralization. it is the hash ratio. in the case of Cardano. it is the ADA copper. This attack is difficult to implement in practice. The Government has other softer methods to attack networks as prescribed. confiscated property. imprisoned. if an application of a large tax rate for operations or stake. it can push it out of the country. It may not threaten the survival of life. but it will impair focus. Internal attacks can be performed by people near the network and take responsibility for the networks operation. They may be important pool operations. a development group. but may also be ASIC hardware manufacturers. energy suppliers. the censorship of transactions is always the decision of the Pool operation. They can do so for the requirements specified. A Mew attack. a attack in which operators manipulate transactions in a way that benefits them. has economic motives. No one can expect an attack from the development team responsible for publishing workstation applications. The development group may depend on the funding from the VC Fund or other sources. The members of the development group can be loyal to those who pay them. not the community. It may be relatively difficult to find the motivation to promote the development groups that decide to deploy a number of functions or vice versa without deploying that function. This is a difficult internal attack. Some cases may not be an intentional attack on the network but may affect the appearance of Spof. when exploiting Bitcoin in China. it brings the highest profits. the country prevails. When China decided to chase miners out of the country.',\n",
       " ' the network was temporarily weakened. We can describe it as an unintentional external situation that has a direct impact on the network. The largest spof can usually be found during the block production. There may be thousands of nodes in a network. but there may be some nodes with dominant positions. you can see 4 pool operators. each operator has 25% market share of block production. There are also 4 common nodes of other users. Ignore the linked structure. Imagine the attacker is looking for targets for the DDOS attack. The production of blocks is not affected by the attack on the user nodes. The attacker must target block production nodes. ie nodes operated by Alice. All groups have the same mass production ratio. so the attacker choosing which node is not important. He can choose multiple nodes to attack. maybe all 4 nodes. In the SPOF point of view. this network is ideal because it is difficult to find the target for a DDOS attack. This insight can help us rather a rough quality of decentralization. If you find a point in the network may be attacked and a hidden attack can cause a problem. the network has been focused. Finding the right target to attack will be difficult or must be a large number of entities. The need for as many block manufacturers as possible and ideally they should have almost equal representation in the network. There are a large number of groups in Cardano network. Although some MPOs have a stronger than SPO. the number of MPo and the proportion of their mass production is relatively balanced. A decentralized decision -making of delegates because their choice affects the balance in the system. It can be assumed that the largest spof in the crypto industry can be found in the Bitcoin network. of which two groups dominated Foundry USA and Antpool to exploit more than 50% of the blocks. These nodes (certainly have a backup conversion strategy) is the weakest point of Bitcoin. you can see 9 groups with the current exploitation market share. If the attacker tries to defeat all nodes simultaneously with a DDOS attack. then the exploitation of new blocks will basically stop temporarily. Pool operators have a significant influence on the Bitcoin network when voting changes to the new version of the workstation (installed on their nodes). The position of most pool operators. whether in Cardano or Bitcoin. depends on the authorized power. The operator does not behave at the will of the representative who may quickly lose his position. this is a assumption. If a large mining company is registered in the United States. the company may agree with the behavior of operating the operating pool. which will comply with the requirements of the management agency. The famous Mew attacks are mainly due to Ethereum. where they often occur. This requires the cooperation of the operator of the pool and the miner. Those who are authorized large. ie those who hold the majority of resources.',\n",
       " ' are also spofs. They may be equivalent to 10.000 small delegates. We may think that it is unfair but cannot be stopped. Money can buy power. if it is possible to earn financial profits from a solid position. that is the case of both Stake and exploiting. there will be whales in the system. Project development groups are a weakness of decentralization. We talked about the VC fund that could buy the teams loyalty. If the project has enough capital for the next many years. it can be independent of the venture capital fund. This is the case of the IOG group. the fundraising group to develop through the original sale of ADA. VC funds were deliberately eliminated from the first sale. the IOG group is independent of the third party and manages the development of protocols according to their terms. If this money is sold to the VC Fund. the group may be affected by their requirements. This is positive or not. The negative thing may be that VC funds can pour money as soon as the first success appears. The IOG group thought about the future so the project fund was also part of the protocol. The implementation of the on-chain management plan will allow the ADA owners to decide which changes will be made. who will make changes. how much cost and what will be prioritized. If there is only one workstation. the group built it (and continues to maintain it) will be a focus. Focus on the workstation. If there is a serious error in the source code. the workstation has a problem. that error can cause the block production process to be stopped. It will be convenient if there are many implementation of workstation applications from independent groups. This increases the recovery of the network against a serious failure when deploying a workstation. but at the same time increases decentralization because there are many groups. All current networks in the Top 20 depend on a dominant workstation. we have not had much experience in the existence of many development groups at the same time and must coordinate with adding new features to the protocol. The situation where the development group cannot innovate is not ideal. If the development group controls the development as they like. this is only accepted at a certain stage. larger decentralization will take place through on-chain administration or workstation diversity. There are many types of vectors on the outside and inside. The goal of the attack is almost always an important power center. Perhaps it is impossible to achieve the state that all network entities will be equal. There will always be weaknesses that can become Spof at a certain stage. the largest Spofs are dominant block manufacturers. whales control large quantities of resources (operators and large stakes). groups and dependence on the dominant workstation. A decentralization is a mobile goal. Someone certainly has continuously tried to improve decentralized quality in a certain network. This may be complicated. The entity trying to do this does not need to be allowed to become a power center.',\n",
       " ' The establishment of on-chain management may be necessary because all the token owners will be responsible for decentralization. Most people who decide to manage their assets use lightweight wallets. This is also applied to people using hardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger. These wallets connect to a full node operated by third parties. Users not only choose lightweight wallets but also choose a third party but they must trust. we will explain how these favorite wallets work. You can install your wallet as an application on your computer. A more common method is adding extensions to your browser. You can start using Cardano wallet such as Yoroi. Flint and other wallets as a browser extension. This is the fastest and probably the safest way to get a wallet. Always carefully check if you receive your wallet from a safe source. The scammers sometimes seek to put the fraudulent wallet of the same name into the online store. There are lightweight wallets acting as a web service. You must enter the service of the service and log in. If you decide to use this type of wallet. create a seal in your browser to avoid importing the URL manually. Scammers often create a very similar URL on a URL. Lightweight wallet has the advantage of being operating immediately after installation because it is not necessary to download the entire history of blockchain to your device. Every time you open your wallet. you will have updated information about your money and you can immediately send a new transaction. Each lightweight wallet connected to a remote server also runs a full node. This infrastructure is operated by a third party. usually the same group responsible for developing wallets. In the picture below. you can see that two users are using lightweight wallets. Alice uses Yoroi wallet connected to the infrastructure of Emurgo. Bob uses his own Lace wallet and stores his own lock in the Trezor hardware wallet to enhance security. Lace wallet connects to infrastructure from the IOG group. Sometimes people complain that the wallet is slightly operating slowly. This is reflected in the fact that users have to wait very long before I recover the balance or take a long time to send the transaction. It is important to note that these delays can only occur between the wallet and the remote server regardless of the state of the blockchain. Users send request to the server to be connected to the database and full node cardano. Immediately after the server receives the necessary information. it will send that information back to the wallet. If the user sends the transaction. they will be sent to the server. then they will transfer them to the full node. Full node authenticating transactions and distributing them to other peer -to -peer network nodes. Cardano network may flood transactions. In such a case. there may be a complete node that cannot be sent online. This can lead to the user to wait long to confirm.',\n",
       " ' you can see a large number of users connected to a server (and a full node) via a lightweight wallet. Infrastructure may not be able to handle all requirements quickly. the problem may be on the infrastructure side. The group should solve the problem. It may be necessary to add another server or full node. All Blockchain wallets must be open source. Users will be able to verify how to handle seeds (passwords) and separate locks. People should make sure that there is no serious gap or a back door in the wallet can allow the user to steal money. Cardano ecosystem has never had a problem with a serious vulnerability in the wallet software. serious problems have occurred in the crypto ecosystem. a wallet sent the password in the open form to authenticate the language. The group used a third party library and did not notice this phenomenon. Another wallet accidentally stores a password cluster on Cloud. This is why it is important to use wallets from reliable and reputable sources. Open source software is often considered safer because its code can be considered by anyone. which makes it harder to detect. Passphase and separate lock are never leaving the wallet. The group is not allowed to find out the secret code that allows you and only you spend money. Remember that both passwords and separate locks are not allowed to leave the wallet. After the group or anyone else knows the secret code. they can steal your money. you can see how the code is sent from the wallet to the server by the group. The group that can create and sign a transaction will be valid. the actual group stole your money. If the wallet is not an open source. users must completely trust the group. This will be a less preferred choice. it is good to know the identities of the group members. It will be very convenient to use hardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger because it is not necessary to use lightweight wallets to create a separate password and store. Private locks are always stored safely on hardware wallets and never lost. lightweight wallets are only used to create and send transactions online. the important step of signing transactions. allowing money transfer. is done safely in hardware wallets. Private courses needed for this signing will never leave the hardware wallet. The image below shows that the security of money depends only on the password cluster stored carefully by Alice in a safe place and separate courses never leave the hardware wallet. Lightweight wallet is only used as a user and blockchain interface (or third -party server connected to Blockchain). People dont want and probably will never want to run their node. All types of crypto depends largely on concentrated infrastructure. The self -management of money through hardware wallets is a mandatory for the community to use crypto. Users should pay more attention to the infrastructure they use and the people they trust. This is not only for wallet applications but also for DEFI applications.',\n",
       " ' Open source software should be a priority choice. People should realize that the blockchain is an open source. but they access it through wallets that may not belong to the same group that has launched the blockchain and may not be an open source. People believe in Blockchain. but first they should trust the wallet they use to access the blockchain.January 27. K33 shows himself as an analytical company focusing on Crypto. It targets professional investors. They recently released a study noted for why you should sell all your ada (Cardano). This note is only 2 pages long. this is surprising. I expect more from an analysis company. The content is even more shocking. Analysts say nothing happens on Cardano. That 90k transaction is not significant. The reason for selling ADA is mainly because there is no stablecoin supported in USD. They compare Cardano with Neo. IOTA and EOS projects. They consider scientific assessment and research based on research as unnecessary luxury things for financial protocols. Take advantage of this opportunity and look at it from a slightly different angle that perhaps analysts from K33 are missing. I understand that many users ignore decentralized. TPS and UX smoothly are more decisive factors for some of them. But can the decentralization be overlooked by analysts? I will consider it a mistake. I have no intention of explaining what is promoting the Crypto industry and that decentralization is the most important thing in the long run. What surprised me not only analysts from K33 but also many others could not measure this important feature and compare each project. I dare to say that Ouroboros POS is the best solution to implement this consensus mechanism in the crypto industry. The liquidity Stake is a better solution to use third parties like Lido in the Ethereum ecosystem. The impact of Stake liquidity on decentralized quality is clear. 33 million stake people. This is a significant number if you think there will be about 10 to 100 thousand miners in the Bitcoin network. In terms of the number of online participants. Cardano is working very well and most likely surpasses Bitcoin at this important index. Has analysts compared the number of participants on different networks?. Stake is a slightly passive activity. similar to POW exploitation. it seems to be evidence that a part of the Crypto community cares about decentralization and is ready to stake their capital into it. I dont understand why analysts from K33 do not have a positive evaluation of Cardanos decentralization. If they try Stake on all POS platforms. they will have to admit that Cardano has an advantage. They should know that IOTA is still a concentrated project and anchor and EOS has a fixed number of manufacturers. a large community around these projects has never been formed. K33 analysts think that there are more meaningful and meaningful transactions. If they consider some research on this topic. they will find that most of the original tokens transactions are transactions related to centralized exchanges.',\n",
       " ' For payment. BTC. ETH and ADA are used very little. Token has helped increase traffic on the Blockchain network a lot. With the encryption of real assets. the importance of tokens will increase. So what does the transaction mean?. It seems that only transactions with stablecoin are supported in USD significantly from the K33 point of view. It has some meaning from the paid perspective. DEFI currently has no stablecoin on all ecosystems. I consider the original money swap to get the DEFI project token as meaningful transactions. It is important to test technology. The market price and the meaning of token are usually secondary. The encryption of real assets can take place on the foundation where the token has existed for several years and can be effectively swapped. TVL on Cardano grows naturally in a price market. which is not completely normal. Cardano recently reached the top 10 in this data. I do not want to believe that people who advise people to sell ADA do not notice this. TVL can develop through a number of large volume transactions. But that is not the case of Cardano. The biggest discontent of K33 analysts is that Cardano has no USDT and USDC. That is true. but the following content in notes is meaningless:. No USDT or USDC in the network often means that there is no DEFI that makes any meaning and Tether and Circle certify this because if anything happens. they will release Stablecoin there. They think that Circle and Tether are not interested in deploying Stablecoin on Cardano because nothing happens in DEFI. Crypto experts should know the real reason. They should know what the original property is and this feature does not allow Circle and Tether companies to control the control of Stablecoin belongs to users. Can not freeze accounts or addresses on the black list on Cardano. They should also know how much the companies cost for deploying stablecoin online. It is not that they dont want to use Cardano. but that rule will probably not allow them (or their hobby of control of their assets) and no one pays them for 8 numbers. Other smart contract platforms are friendly. Cardano does not. I can understand that some analysts can evaluate it to make it friendly with the rules closer to the application. they do not realize the fact that decentralized principles are being trampled. Cardano will have stablecoin supported in USD in the future. Mehen USDM will probably be released soon. Agreement with Circle and Tether is still valid. Add functions can be added to USDC and USDT on Cardano. I do not understand why analysts think that it is impossible to transfer USDC and USDT to Cardano. Perhaps they dont know anything about what is going behind. The biggest mistake that K33 analysts suffer is their misunderstanding about the UTXO model and the model cannot count the number of real transactions on Cardano. This topic has been described and explained many times. A significant number of cardano transactions is not related to the interaction between the two users but is between many users.',\n",
       " ' K33 analysts should know that the number of smart contract transactions is almost equal to normal transactions. even a non -smart contract is not necessarily an interaction between only two participants. Cardano intentionally operates in a way that can insert multiple user operations into a transaction. This saves space and fee. The normal cardano block looks like the image below. Although there are 32 normal transactions in the bloc (these are what TPS tells you). note that 311 UTXO has been transferred and 88 transactions shifted to foreign accounts that have taken place. Analysts cannot rely on TPS statistics in the case of Cardano. This is not appropriate (incorrect) for Cardano. If they want to count the number of user activities. they will have to perform on-chain quality analysis. Half of the transactions taking place in Cardano can be multiplied by a certain constant. I guess it may be some from 2 to 8. 90.000 transactions can actually be in the range of 150.000 to 500. Experts will be able to measure it. no tools in the Cardano ecosystem can display more accurately the number of user activities. As far as I know. this can only be done through some homemade tools. The transaction attribute is significantly different on smart contract platforms. If analysts studied the smart contract platform more. they will discover that some of them have a high fee that users have to pay even when they fail. This usually happens on Ethereum. In other places. fees can be predicted and fixed. these transactions Always-Success if overcome the local authentication process. This is how Cardano works. I believe that K33 analysts are hearing about this for the first time. From a user perspective. this is a great advantage that is beneficial for Cardano. It is ridiculous when an analysis company considers a project based on research. scientific evaluation and the use of formal methods in the development process is unnecessary luxury things. You can find this in the study noted from K33:. The silly scientific story will deceive more people to Cardano. but the best thing is that they are growing less and less. If they do not see the number of hacked incidents over the years and the amount of money stolen because they are amateur. If they think the future financial world will be fine or that time will improve it. they should not introduce anything to anyone. Some public opinion polls have shown that the hacks in the DEFI are one of the first barriers to the application. DEFI on cardano is small compared to Ethereum. I dare to say that the Cardano ecosystem has not happened any hack is a significant success. The vulnerability in the source code of the smart contract and the command set is mainly in the responsibility of third -party developers. the design of the protocol and the characteristics of the platform contribute to a certain extent to how safety applications are built on them. Programming language. available tools and the ability to use regular methods to develop and test affect the quality of the applications created.',\n",
       " ' Research -based approach and experts from individual fields in the IOG group have contributed to help Cardano work very well in the field of security. This is not an accident. All IT giants like Amazon. Google. Meta or Microsoft use the same development method like the IOG group for the main parts of the software. The regular methods are often used for NASA software. hospitals. nuclear power plants and other important applications. One of the reasons why IT giants maintain their position is enough to pay for the best minds in the world. who can develop the most effective solution for certain problems. The challenging blockchain industry and complex technology obstacles. Software built for banks and financial institutions also play an important role. Very strict standards must be followed during development. The development is very slow and expensive. Similar to Cardano Solana often asks to restart. Ethereum has encountered some network problems in the past. One of them. the network cannot complete transactions. Cardano has never had such a problem. It is not a coincidence. That is how the project is developed. The ambition of the crypto industry is very high. Everyone wants money on the blockchain and the actual assets are encrypted. We want DEFI to become an alternative to mainstream financial services. This will never happen unless the services on Blockchain are 100%safe. reliable. cheap. fast. can be predicted and economic sustainability in the long term. I am afraid that analytical companies dont know anything about the importance of a group for a blockchain project. Blockchain is a technology. The protocols must be maintained and improved by someone. I believe that the future success of projects will depend on the technological dominance. The key to technological dominance is a team. The IOG group has more than 600 members from 60 countries and cooperates with some universities. Cardano has a project fund to finance future development. If someone can be aware of the complexity of the blockchain project. he cannot advise you to sell ADA just because it is temporarily missing Stablecoin. It is ridiculous. The success of blockchain projects is a combination of technology and community. Both are important. Blockchain was built from the beginning. for humans for humans. The application is mainly decided by the people. not by any organization or government. We can see that. people have successfully voted by holding the projects money. You can find many analysis that Cardano is a popular project. similar to Solana or Ripple. The younger projects are not too bad for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is not an outstanding project that will be held by 10 times more than Ethereum. The difference is narrowing. Comparing Cardano with older projects such as NEO. EOS or IOTA is unfounded and quite lost. When I stopped watching the IOTA project. it was not even a smart contract foundation. The anchor group is just copy/paste EVM. There are only 5 applications created on this platform. EOS fails mainly due to Cartel agreement between block manufacturers.',\n",
       " ' Cardano is in a completely different position. The community built different tools. Hundreds of application groups. But most importantly. the community found that the group is gradually doing what has promised and technology is gradually improving. Cardano is becoming better every year. Just look at the content of the upgrades. This cannot talk about the above projects. Perhaps only the IOTA group is still active. People cheered for Cardano although it did not have Stablecoin supported in USD. They know it is a matter of time. The reasons why Cardano believes are technology (Stake. original property. decentralization (including plan-chain management) and large community. In the K33 research noted they wrote:. Everything never happens in one night and these processes often take years to take place fully. all price signals also indicate that ADA is gradually disappearing from the crypto map. ADA did not gain the same score like other stronger smart contract tokens when the market was improved. this was a powerful sign that a dead token was about to die. They can believe that the crypto industry has been mature enough to market market capitalization reflects the quality of technology and applicability. I am afraid of them wrong. The market capitalization currently has almost no signals. The market is motivated by speculation. narration and whales. Crypto is still an overseas field for some enthusiasts. Although there are more than 500 million people holding crypto. most of them (about 95%) have no wallets. Most Crypto holders today have not made any online transactions. They do not have their own experience in using blockchain. They have not tried the DEFI or Lightning Network application. I mean here that most people have made choices based on some stories or speculation. Only tens of millions of younger people have a direct experience with Blockchain. The main application waves have not yet come. I estimate that it will take at least one decade for 10% of the population to use Crypto daily. And by the way. at that time Cardano will have some stablecoin supported in USD. Analysts are sometimes caught up in the current situation and do not see too far about the future. This is expected from those who do not understand the history of Crypto. Those who become rich thanks to Ethereum are willing to pay 0. 1 ETH for each transaction. I can assure you that people who are about to join the crypto industry will never pay so much for a transaction. And now we can start talking about the ability to expand and the future. The IOG group has a great plan for this. But leave it another time. A research noted from K33 is inferior to a common article from the media about Crypto B. I consider it as evidence that they cannot conduct quality research. do not understand the technology behind Crypto and do not know what is important for a blockchain project. Their argument about selling ADA is based on no stablecoin. They innocently think that there will never be USDC on Cardano.',\n",
       " ' They do not understand why the IOG group decided to build Cardano like a bank or NASA software. They do not consider Stake as a relevant activity. Rarely see many misunderstandings and conclusions in such two pages of text. After reading the report from Messari. which has strongly promoted Solana. this is another example of how analysts see the world of Crypto. In the case of Messari. everything began to make reason when Ryan Selkis publicly recognized that he had Sol in his portfolio. Crypto industry is young and everyone is learning. Very few people can identify themselves as experts in a certain field. I feel that analysis and reports are similar to Messaris analysis and reporting analysis or K33 for the purpose of marketing the projects they have in their investors. The bias is too clear to my hobbies. The conclusions are far from objectivity. They are based on sketchy information without a wider scene. Many things may be criticized for Cardano. But this is applied to all existing ecosystems. Some projects before Cardano in some features. Cardano has an advantage. The comparison is very difficult. if not impossible. Can not ignore the basic principles of the project and advise people to sell ADA for one thing they consider to be important. I will not hear this advice.January 19. *Cardanos next hardfork takes us in the voltaire era. look inside to find out what it is related and when. Cardano is currently in the Voltaire era. the final stage of the Cardano route. The Voltaire era is when Cardano becomes a completely decentralized network. through the application of community management. where all the stakeholders of the network. everyone holds ADA (friend). can have a voice in the development of the network in the future. Chang is the first hardfork of the Voltaire era and here we will discuss what it brings to the network and users. starting from hardfork (and why they are better on Cardano). HardFork is a fundamental change in the blockchain protocol that affects the validity of blocks and transactions on a decentralized network. It requires all (or most) nodes and the authentication process to upgrade to the new version of the software. If not upgraded. two blockchain chains will be created. one running new software and one running old software. The example of this happens is the hardfork of Ethereum (2016) and HardFork Bitcoin Cash (2017). All blockchain networks have hardfork. as this is how decentralized networks are upgraded. Cardano made them in a different way. Cardano uses the HardFork CombINATOR set to ensure that. instead of restarting the tradition related to hardfork events on other blockchains. there will be a smooth transformation between protocol versions. It allows both the new and old version of the ledger to run at the same time for a period of time before the conversion process to the new version is completed. This ensures that the whole history of Cardano appears in the form of a single ledger. It also means that not all authentic nodes must be updated immediately - but nodes running the old version of the software can not handle transactions to register new rules of the ledger.',\n",
       " ' Learn more on HardFork Cardano Docs. The Hardfork Chang is planned at the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter of 2024 and will introduce the concept of management of the community that can exist at least for the Cardano blockchaino by establishing the capabilities for the on-chain consensus mechanism. adjusted by the Constitution. This means that all stakeholders of Cardano (ADA owner) will be able to participate in the shaping of the network. Hardfork Chang is an event that starts all. allowing the starting of the transparent Cardano administration in 2024. There will be three main stages in this process:. This is the peak that all Cardano has been aiming for for many years - through all hardfork. fuds. market prices. fud and market prices up. If you have not participated in the CIP-1694 discussion or participate in any management seminar. there is still time. as a global constitution of the conference chain will be organized transparently in 2024. See the organization focusing on the management of the Interect leader to learn more about how you can participate.January 17. Management organizations are looking for blockchain networks suitable for their business activities. They will have requirements in accordance with their regulations and needs. Projects allowed by the generous VC Fund will try to meet this demand. The new blockchain is emerging on a good scale but has to pay for decentralization. Some projects are even deliberately implemented in a way that can freeze user accounts. Projects like Cardano may be alone for decentralization will be out of the orthodox trend. One of the first ideas is that people will start using Bitcoin to pay. By stopping using the Fiat currency. they will force organizations to use Bitcoin. Based on observing peoples behaviors in the past 15 years. we can confirm that this is hard to happen. We have approved Bitcoin ETF for a long time. We can all use Bitcoin. Most crypto types are available on centralized exchanges. Interested in Lightning Network needs to increase. People have not used this network much. Organizations do not have a plan to use Bitcoin as a financial infrastructure. They only plan to buy and sell crypto the same way they do it with other investment assets. Blackrock CEO. Larry Flink. found the value of Ethereum ETFs and the future of encrypting everything. New blockchain projects are emerging supported by VC Fund. These projects are designed to be the most appropriate to be possible with financial institutions. Groups do not consider the requirements of users in the future if we are interested in decentralized principles. The fact that todays financial institutions are managed. this is reflected in the infrastructure they use. If the law requires organizations to have KYC and AML mechanisms. their infrastructure must support them. This may include the ability to report suspicious transactions. block transactions. put into a black list or freeze accounts. It is sad to see many people who have the influence on the newly supported VC blockchain with the money bribes in their pockets and consider compatibility with the organizations requirements as an advantage.',\n",
       " ' They do not know the decentralized principles or ignore them. It is important to observe the reason for creating many new projects and the main motivation of the groups. the main goal is not to provide a decentralized project to preserve the benefits of decentralization for users. The goal of the groups is to provide a blockchain that organizations will use to move financial services. Blackrocks CEO thinks that Bitcoin is not a currency but an investment property. If he talks about everything. it will probably happen. All projects want to become a selected project. which contains all the worlds assets. Let us not talk about what the project will be. Many projects may be successful. lets pay attention to the features that these projects will provide to end users in a decentralized context. Perhaps this idea will surprise you. but it has not existed a suitable blockchain to encrypt to meet the requirements of organizations and management agencies. I do not believe that encryption will take place on the blockchain. where all transactions are public. For the benefit of the user. their assets and financial transactions are kept confidential. Moving from current financial services to public blockchain is not a good idea. The key technology of the next decade will be Zero-Knowledge. Zero-Knowledge coding can be used for security and increased expansion. We will see new chains. whether Layer 1 or Layer 2. will meet the needs of users and organizations that are managed. Midnight project. will be Cardanos partner series. in accordance with this concept. There are very little information about Midnight. So I cant say whether I can write an application that can freeze user accounts. But to be honest. I expect Midnight will allow that. because it is thought to be friendly. This is not only applicable to sensitive personal and commercial data protection. but also for KYC & AML. Midnight partner series is not the only project that can be used to encrypt everything. The groups are working on many Zero-Knowledge synthesis. Solana even allows you to send secret transactions. I am sure that the traditional financial sector will undergo decline. There will be movement of services to Blockchain network. Blockchain technology is mature. The obstacles that hinder the application of the past. especially the ability to expand low and lack of privacy. will be overcome in the near future. ETF has opened an important gate in Crypto legalization. Many states are completing the legal framework for Crypto. I am afraid that the decentralization will fall behind in the application race. A basic feature of this field will be ignored. Satoshis initial vision victory. Large investors will tend to pour money into projects with potential to become a part of the worlds new financial backbone. Retails have followed this trend and basically copies behavior of big investors. Payment with crypto and I hope it will still be a marginal problem for some enthusiasts. The interest in Crypto will be mainly motivated by the investment engine.',\n",
       " ' The dominant token on Blockchain (and Layer 2) will be stablecoin. not the rooted token with high fluctuations. Perhaps in some countries. CBDC will exist on a permitted blockchain with the support of Layer 2 network. I am afraid that chains like Cardano will not become the main trend despite efforts to achieve high decentralization. on-chain administration and functions like native assets. If a top 10 ranking is synthesized. Cardano will definitely head with the desire to win. decentralization is probably not a feature that affects the market capitalization. because it is not a feature that companies are interested in. You may think this is a very pessimistic scenario for Cardano. It is important to note that Cardano is not the core protocol but also an ecosystem. Midnight is a series of partners and ecosystems. The potential of Midnight at least can be a part of success for Cardano. I believe that Cardano has a lot to provide in addition to decentralization. it is a large and experienced team that is and will continue to lead in innovation and use of formal methods in Cardano development. reliability and sustainability are essential features for future financial systems. Many newer project groups are trying to quickly bring products to the market with lower quality costs. Many of these projects can be successful when advertised but failed in the long run. The features of the original assets may not be suitable for organizations that are managed because they do not allow the account to freeze. many people love this. can the original property be used to token or bonds? I cannot answer that question. but organizations will find another solution. It is difficult to say whether it is possible to transfer financial assets to Cardano via the bridge or not and whether the government wants to prevent this due to lack of control. Cardano will continue to exist and anyone can use it. What I want to see in the first class is higher privacy. But that will be for another article. Cardano will be in the hands of the community. the community will determine the priorities and development directions. The community will start deciding important details that will affect the decentralization of the protocol and operation of the Plutus platform. The absence of USDC and USDT on Cardano is one of many topics that community members have different opinions. If it is true that the future of finance is Blockchain. then their groups and innovation are also an important part. Cardano may not be part of the future financial infrastructure. as the IOG group can provide anything that the community thinks is important to apply. The ability to adapt quickly and effectively with the requirement is a great advantage. It may take 5 to 10 years to make the process of taking over the beginning. There is still a lot of time for Cardano to expand the scale better. have more security features and most importantly. let the community think about the future financial world.',\n",
       " ' A decentralization will face difficult times. Supporters may have difficulty promoting and highlighting its benefits. it is difficult to predict the future. It can indicate that less concentrated blockchains have problems that decentralized blockchains are better than without. There will be debates not only about the number of block manufacturers but a certain network but also for the entity that owns the network and who decides the roadmap in the future. Cardano should follow his own speed on the decentralized path and keep Satoshis vision. Blockchain allows users to own tokens and have full control of them. No third party can take your money or prevent you from spending or using them at any time. Blockchain network can provide this for original tokens such as ADA. BTC and ETH. But there is a big difference between tokens platforms. Cardano processes all tokens similar to ADA. So it will not allow anyone to control the token that users have in their wallets. Ethereum is more flexible. It allows token token publishers to control their time transparent token. lets explore the difference between the tokens on Cardano and Ethereum. Blockchain protocol is a set of rules and guidelines related to all functions provided by certain projects. In the protocol. you will find rules related to the maximum amount of principal. rules for them to gradually be put into circulation. It determines the rules (spending conditions) to transfer money from one address to another. When users send transactions online. the protocol will authenticate the transaction according to the prescribed rules. The protocol only accepts valid transactions. The protocol rules are determined by the development group. All participants in the networks consensus mechanism monitor the compliance with rules. You can find these rules in the available source archive (github). You can say that the tokens (your property) are protected by decentralization. because third parties cannot arbitrarily change rules. Most of the network participants must agree to change the rules. If there is no determination to freeze the account in rules. the protocol will not allow this. The censorship of transactions (or putting the address on the black list) is almost impossible to execute. If the decentralized network of the network is high and at least one minority of participants (block manufacturers) will not censor the transaction. all users can spend money. you can see Alice and Bob use the protocol through their wallet. The development group has identified the protocol rules. The ability to control the rules of the development group is limited in decentralized networks because the network is controlled by consensus participants (those holding expensive resources). Alice and Bob have full control of this amount. No third party can freeze Alice or Bobs accounts or prevent them from spending money. Users own exclusive money and can spend them through a transaction. Users depend on the network to be able to spend money. The network can be considered intermediaries (third party) between Alice and Bob. it is not a single entity but a group of people involved in network consensus (block manufacturers.',\n",
       " ' people authorizing resources. those who do not know each other and have a truthful motor. you can see that Alice and Bob do not need to trust in a specific third party. They believe in the decentralization of the protocol. the group of participants agreed. The absence of a third party makes Native Token a very safe digital property only owned by anyone who has a separate control (wallet). The principal transfer is directly guaranteed by the protocol rules. The tokens are stored in a ledger (on the blockchain). The token is usually different from the native token. mainly because their existence is not determined (guaranteed) at the protocol level. Token can be cast by anyone. There is always a third party that determines the number of tokens will exist. what token will be called. whether they can be burned or not and other details. It is also possible to decide whether to cast all tokens at the same time or the number of tokens will increase over time (the publisher can cast new tokens later). Some platforms may even allow to identify a number of conditions or policies related to the gradual issuance of tokens into circulation. The token publisher can hold the control of tokens (through smart contracts) forever or give up control. Different platforms have different options. the third party may be a third party casting Stablecoin. The bank holds the legal and third party (and burns) tokens in a ratio of 1: 1. third parties must control the ability to cast and burn tokens forever. In the case of creating NFT string. control the ability to create new NFT in the chain may be abandoned. It can ensure that the number of NFT will never increase. If the protocol supports the existence of tokens. it must provide these functions in some way:. casting tokens involves identifying parameters such as the name of the token. the number is cast and the cast policy. in Ethereum. token casting is a more complex process involving writing a smart contract. This smart contract includes (casting) functions and tokens management. and must comply with a specific standard (such as ERC-20 or ERC-721) to ensure compatibility with other contracts and wallets. These functions include the ways to transfer tokens from one address to another. Lets consider more carefully about Cardano. We will then consider Ethereum. The difference between the platforms is significant in terms of token. Cardano is designed to work nearest possible with the way the protocol works with ADA. Cardano is called a multi -property ledger. Token publisher has the control of money casting policy. which is the basic attribute of tokens. The protocol is fully responsible for the storage and transfer of tokens. These are the features that the token publisher has no design control. Cardano processes tokens naturally. like ada. ledger and protocol that can handle tokens without a third party (token publisher) provides a source code (Smart Call/Contract) with additional rules and functions for basic activities. Even the token publisher has no way to affect the operation of the protocol in terms of storage and token.',\n",
       " ' you can see how the ability to cast (and burn) token tokens is separated from their ability to transfer and store tokens. This design brings many benefits to users. After the token is transferred to the users blockchain address. they have monopoly control over them. No third party has control over the tokens in the users wallet. Users cannot be restricted in any form of their right token. If the token publisher holds control of token burning. they can only do so if the token is at its address. Users must voluntarily send tokens to the address of the publisher token. the new token can be burned. Cardano is suitable for decentralized principles. The concept used for ADA is also used for tokens at the maximum possible. this also has disadvantages of the scope of application. It is impossible to freeze the account or put the address on the black list on Cardano. This is impossible for ADA and therefore it is not possible for tokens. this is an ideal solution. from the perspective of compatibility with the current financial world regulations. this seems to be a disadvantage. It depends on whether you are a life enthusiast for Satoshis original traditional admiration or a pragmatic person who wants to see Blockchain protocols gradually replacing the outdated financial infrastructure. The IOG group has chosen this token design for many other benefits. There is no dependence between casting and tokens. This means that it is possible to insert a variety of tokens into a transaction at the same time. There is no need to use third -party functions (source code) to transfer. so it is performed at the protocol level. This means that the transfer is effective and therefore cheap. It is also safer because the Cardano protocol is used daily. so the code has been tested very well. Users are isolated from errors that may be in the third -party code. Cardano design also has the advantage of using tokens in the application. Applications work with tokens similar to Coin ADA. This is easy because there is no need to work with smart contracts that can identify different behaviors for each token (although the standards make this easier). The use of tokens in applications is very effective and inexpensive. similar to money transfer. Casting tokens is relatively simple and does not require the definition of token transfer functions. the publisher only identifies the basic properties of the token. Tokens life cycle in Cardano includes setting up everything. building addresses and new locks. creating casting policies. editing casting transactions. charging. sending transactions and casting tokens. sending tokens to wallets and burning options for burning tokens (from the address of the token publisher). Although the cardano platform seems ideal and safe for casting tokens. the paradox is that you will not find USDT and USDC stablecoin on it. This is because Circle and Tether require the function of the traditional financial system. which means they require the ability to freeze the user account or address on the black list.',\n",
       " ' They cannot deploy this function on Cardano. this is an obstacle for them. Lets see how tokens work on Ethereum. The token publisher on Ethereum must write a contract to identify all the functions related to the token. Token is created and managed by smart contracts. The most popular tokens. such as ERC-20. identify a set of functions to interact with the token. including token transfer and address query of the address. The Ethereum protocol itself does not directly manage the token. it provides infrastructure. namely the Ethereum (EVM) virtual machine that allows the execution of smart contracts. Without EVM. Ethereum will not be able to transfer or store tokens. This is a big difference between Cardano and Ethereum. When the token is created. the smart contract will record the number of tokens and assign it to the Ethereum address. This is usually done in the construction function of smart contracts when it is first implemented. Each Ethereum address interacts with tokens with relevant balance. stored in the state of smart contracts. Status is the data structure that stores all information about the contract. including the balance of all addresses. When the token is transferred. the contract will update the status to reflect the new balance. Money transfer function is part of a smart contract that allows sending tokens from one address to another. You can see it in the picture below. The smart contract control token is used for all functions including token transfer. When Alice sent tokens to Bob. this was done through the code deployed in smart contracts. The token is cast on Ethereum with many disadvantages compared to Cardano. The execution of smart contracts consumes more resources than using the original protocol function. And the fee will be higher. Send more tokens in a slightly complex transaction. The source code of the issuer may contain errors. Applications work with tokens. smart contract. must interact with the smart contract of the token. This is a different approach to Cardano. where applications interact with the functions of the protocol layer. Ethereum allows the constituent of smart contracts. meaning a smart contract can interact with another contract. Can string the function of smart contracts together. A smart contract can call another contract. this contract calls a third contract. It is sometimes called lego money. This allows building complicated behaviors and interactions from simpler behaviors and interactions. This may be an advantage for some cases of use. Cardanos smart contracts are more separate. which may limit certain types of interactions but can also reduce the risk of this contract that negatively affects other contracts. Can freeze the account and put on the black list in the smart contract Ethereum. This is usually done by putting specific rules into smart contracts. It is important to say that it is possible to create a smart contract in accordance with decentralized ideals. Ethereum is more flexible about the ability to create specific functions. it should be added that this allows this to create conditions for companies like Circle to abuse it.',\n",
       " ' USDC publisher. can freeze and put addresses to the black list. When an address is included in the black list. that address will not be able to receive USDC anymore. All USDC is blocked by that address and cannot be transferred on-chain. Only the administrators address can update the smart contract with the address listed on the black list. If a manager has the opportunity to use blockchain. it will limit decentralization. Although users have the right to choose. most of them are not interested in decentralized details. USDC is a very successful project despite what Circle can do with user accounts. The design of individual platforms shows which features are preferred by groups. the focus is decentralized principles. A cardano transaction. including command transactions. will almost always be inserted into a block if it exceeds the local authentication process. The token transactions are independent and easy to verify. the focus is flexibility and combination ability. When Ethereum is created. it is thought that all functions must be executed on-chain. The ability to write almost everything in smart contracts and let the token -controlled token publisher proves to be an advantage related to application by financial institutions managed. I believe that the Blockchain industry should have higher ambitions rather than only renovating traditional financial infrastructure.January 16. A part of the community wants USDC on Cardano. On other blockchain platforms. USDC can freeze accounts with USDC addresses on the black list. a part of the community does not want this stablecoin on Cardano. discuss how to receive USDC on Cardano. Stablecoin is an essential part of any DEFI ecosystem. as they solve one of the biggest obstacles for using crypto. which is fluctuations. Financial services require stability. If the blockchain industry wants to bring financial infrastructure to developing countries. Stablecoin is an important component. Regarding tokenization. the two most successful projects are USDT and USDC. Both projects are in the top 10 in market capitalization. USDC will bring more liquidity to the Cardano ecosystem and therefore new users will also come. This will be a significant promotion for DEFI on Cardano. USDC is present on most large networks. You can find this stablecoin on Ethereum. Stellar. Hedera Hashgraph and some other types. USDC issuing company. has the right to freeze accounts related to illegal activities or violate their terms of use. Above all the platforms mentioned. can freeze accounts with USDC or black list. USDC violates many decentralized principles. especially related to the users expectations that if they have property in the wallet. no one can confiscate and prevent them from spending. USDC (or USDT) will bring liquidity and new users for the Cardano ecosystem with the price is to sacrifice some decentralized principles. Cardano has the original property (native token). Money -casting commands are only used to cast and burn assets. The transfer of assets takes place through the Cardano protocol. If the user has property in Cardano wallet. there is no way to freeze the account or prevent spending.',\n",
       " ' Cardano considers all tokens as the original assets like ADA. it is perfect and I believe that Cardano is the best asset exploitation platform in the crypto industry. But only when people accept all decentralized principles without exception. Some certain features of Crypto do not comply with the law and regulations. Some companies have complied with the requirements of the law to run profitable business activities in the field of crypto. Circle is one of such companies. USDC is a successful project. On other platforms. USDC is cast through smart contracts. Similar smart contracts are used to transfer stablecoin among users. it is possible to deploy any function that Circle requires. the ability to freeze accounts and addresses on the black list. Circle has a smart contract control and therefore for USDC that users have in their wallets. Users cannot spend USDC if they do not use smart contracts basically approve the transfer of assets. Cardano cannot do this according to the design. so having USDCCC on this platform may not be technically feasible or ineffective. There are initiatives to have ERC-20-like tokens on Cardano. but I dont know the status of these projects right now. The philosophy of Cardano project is suitable for decentralization. Third parties do not need to be allowed to decide what you can do with your property. This principle is basically that it is applied to the cast assets and therefore basically implemented. Circle is said to be asking $ 10-99 million to bring USDC on Cardano. this is a stupid request from the perspective of a business model. because they should bring USDC to more users. This will weaken competition. if so. it is necessary to ask who is the one to pay for it. I dont think IOG should pay that money. They donated money in the public selling phase to build Cardano protocol. This money should be used to research and implement the protocol as well as things that are directly related to it. using this money for Circle is not an appropriate requirement. IOG has hired a new CEO to launch a new Stablecoin joint venture. It may be a good idea if you ask Cardano Foundation and Emurgo to see if they can help. It may have happened in the past but I havent registered any official statement. Emurgo tried to launch his own Stablecoin USDA. So I dont expect the attention from them. The only way seems to be the project budget and Catalyst. Catalyst may help in the preparation stage. Catalyst could not pay such a high amount of money that Circle requested. With ADAs current market price. this will be 20 million ADA in the most optimistic scenario. The total budget for Fund11 is 50 million ADA. And payments may have to come from the project budget. this must be decided by those who hold ADA through a vote. One question is whether voting in Catalyst for USDC project should automatically synonymously approve ADA spending from the budget.',\n",
       " ' Rather no. Perhaps the intersect organization can help it. If the payment comes from the project budget. the question is whether to wait for the market to raise prices when ADAs market price is higher. It is a speculation that can bring results. but on the other hand. it can delay the deployment of USDC on Cardano. We discuss USDC in the article. but can focus on USDT more easily. Cardanos original assets will also be an obstacle in this case. but Tether may have a lower payment request to deploy. Another solution is other stablecoin. Everyone is waiting for the Mehen MEMM project. the project will be launched in early 2024. If the launch successfully at the second trial. Cardano will have a stablecoin that meets the prescribed conditions and works as a original property. This will surpass USDC on all other platforms in terms of crypto principles. The question is why Circle could not run USDC on Cardano as a original asset when Mehens group could. Can convert USDC and USDT to Cardano ecosystem through bridges. You can find USDC and USDT on some DEX today thanks to the Wanchain bridge. people will trust USDC more if it is the original property directly cast on Cardano. Cardano ecosystem can adhere to the principles of crypto and reject USDC and USDT stablecoins with argued that we do not want to support the freezing of property in our wallet. No need to say. the ecosystem is losing user and applicability. I think it would be better to try to get USDC on Cardano but still keep the original property active as it is now. More options are always an advantage. People who do not want to use USDC should have other options. Perhaps that will be Mehen USDM. Who should pay for USDC? For me. the only way seems to be the budget of the project. But perhaps it is not the ideal way to use ADA. Perhaps it would be more reasonable to keep ADA for more important things. If USDM can be launched. Cardano ecosystem will not need USDC. At least not so urgent. the community should argue to see which direction to go. It is positive to see the debate that is going on. We will see if there is any proposal in the Catalyst12 fund.January 11. Gone are the Blockchain period cannot expand the scale. A modern blockchain can handle a large number of transactions per second (TPS). Blockchain without good size will be lost and will soon disappear. Sharding and parallelization are the best way. Bright future. This story is becoming stronger. Many influential people ignore decentralization in the obsession with high TPS. And the nature of the blockchain industry is being forgotten. How to combine expansion and decentralization ability? Think about it. More clearly. modern blockchain needs a better scale than the first generation of blockchain. The network does not make any sense when dividing users into first and second -class citizens because of outdated technology.',\n",
       " ' All users must have the same state. The rich and poor division creates inequality in the system and will be an obstacle to the application. The poor will not apply a system that the rich advantage. If the Blockchain ecosystem does not provide a new user introduction service at a cheap and cheap payment. it will not have the opportunity to compete with traditional financial systems. For DEFI services and all other use cases. expansion is essential. Knowing the above. it is necessary to return to the origin of the crypto industry and remember that the main feature is decentralized. A decentralization is often forgotten in the effort to provide a huge network of TPS for the market. Priority for each blockchain must be in the following order:. Each blockchain balance these characteristics in a different way. That is okay. There is Blockchain preferring decentralization than expansion. The other prefers the ability to expand rather than decentralized. Blockchain can be able to expand high and only moderate decentralized. It will still be helpful. The problem is that teams skip or underestimate decentralization from the beginning may not improve it later. Both decentralization and expansion are non -fixed characteristics. Development groups. along with the community (Node operators). will work to maintain and improve them. If we want to describe decentralization and conditions that a certain project must meet. it can look like this:. Please describe the more detailed points. When Satoshi launched Bitcoin. he was the only producer (miner) on the internet for a while. The network was initially concentrated. but gradually had new miners participated. Bitcoins decentralization has gradually developed. Although Bitcoin now has only 20 manufacturers. everyone has the opportunity to participate in the exploitation. ASIC hardware can be purchased and authorized the hash ratio for one of the pools. An important component of decentralized is the comprehensive. Everyone must be able to participate in the networks consensus mechanism and be rewarded when doing so. A decentralization is mainly about increasing the number of participants. This is the distribution of decisions for the largest number of people who are interested in participating. High TPS networks tend to have high demand for hardware manufacturers in terms of hardware. It is often combined with the need to hold a large number of tokens. The group wants the network to have a smaller number of manufacturers with high quality equipment. The monopoly is the result of high TPS requirements. Communication between less node will be faster. Everyone uses the network can not be a block manufacturer. this option must be open and relatively accessible. some networks have hundreds to thousands of block manufacturers. If the authorized mechanism is used in a certain network. such as in Cardano network. the likelihood of becoming an authorized person will be available to everyone. The barrier of joining must be low. The original token distribution is necessary. a blockchain can only be decentralized if the initial distribution is fair. When a group grows and the VC fund holds most token.',\n",
       " ' blockchain is hard to be considered decentralized. you can see the original token distribution from Messari. A decentralization is to assume that users are controlling the network or the goal is to repeat them in this state. If insiders. development groups and VC funds hold most togens. they will control the network. They can sell tokens someday. Maybe the distribution of money between people will increase. this will improve decentralization. But it is not necessarily happening. If the network is successful and has the potential to develop. the insiders keeping money and profit from the stake will benefit. This is a problem for many projects with high TPS. which is basically funded by the VC Fund. Development groups have provided networks that can be expanded but overlooking decentralization from the beginning. Although the number of independent block manufacturers can increase. improving decentralization. the network will still be controlled largely by insiders. Whales can run block production nodes. but they can also authorize the manufacturer to independently of the ability to change authority at any time. they can provide conditions whereby they will entrust money to the selected producer. I am definitely not saying that it is always like this. a highly expanded network can be created by the original token distribution fairly. The final component of the decentralized decentralization we will talk about is administration. A project may not have any official management. The development team can improve the protocol as you like and do not need to pay attention to the community. Token has no role. if a project is based on holding tokens. the initially unfair token distribution will be a problem. If most of the money is held by the group and VC fund. it is clear that who will make a decision. It is often said that POW networks like Bitcoin are the most fair because all tokens are exploited (earned in the form of rewards). BTC money is not used for management. The problem is that POW exploitation is exclusive. The right to decide to focus on entrepreneurs who own huge exploitation rooms. A decentralized decline in both the number of block manufacturers and exploitation. It is difficult to improve the expansion of a good decentralized blockchain (ignore Layer 2). Improving the decentralization of the network can expand high may be more difficult. If there is a large number of nodes in the network. computer resources (CPU. memory. kit. ) will be available. If the group manages to streamline the consensus mechanism. the expansion capacity will increase. Sharding can be deployed or some forms of parallel. The IOG group plans to improve Cardanos expansion via Input Endorsers. Three block versions with different frequency of exploitation will be created online. The blocks will be connected by hierarchy in a certain way. Input endorser will be more effective than computer resources available online. The IOG group was very smart when putting a decentralization first to the ability to expand and govern in the roadmap. Since HardFork Shelley.',\n",
       " ' the decentralization of the system has developed. the ability to expand is sufficient. although sometimes the network has reached the maximum clearance limit. in the short term. this problem can be solved to some extent by increasing the size of the block. PLUTUS V2 application is more efficient than Plutus V1 application. Because the group has planned from the beginning to give power into the hands of ada holders. the original distribution must be fair. Development groups have built a high TPS network will face a difficult task if they have more decentralized plans. These networks usually have large blocks (for example. up to 128 MB) or very low block time. It requires nodes to have higher calculation power. The network has enough calculated resources on some nodes. so it is unlikely to need additional nodes. Adding new nodes to the network to increase decentralization can increase the complexity of communication. which may not be desired for a specific consensus mechanism. It may be difficult to revise the consensus mechanism to be able to enhance decentralization. such as by being able to participate in a consensus mechanism with a cheaper node (less stronger). I dare to say that the teams will not follow this path. this method is to randomly select a smaller node group (from the total number of nodes) that will participate in the block production at a certain time or some parallel forms (many groups are responsible for a specific part of the consensus mechanism). Authorized system is a form of distribution of decisions and is a suitable path for high TPS networks. Although there will be fewer mass manufacturers. the number of Stake people may be high. A decentralization can be solid. it always depends on the first distribution of tokens. This is the basis necessary for high decentralization. If internal people sell a large number of tokens at the end of the market. people often sell them. so the decentralization does not develop. If the VC funds start to buy tokens at the end of the market. it will cause excitement. which can lead to decentralized development. it may be true that whales and venture capital funds hold most of this money. These cycles may tend to repeat. so the pursuit of larger decentralization may be obstructed forever. From the project image perspective. the decentralization as soon as possible and gradually improving the expansion will be more attractive and reliable than in the opposite order. Many articles have been written about why decentralization is important. If we apply networks with high TPS but not decentralized (and without administration). we will create a network similar to Paypal and banks. The only difference is that instead of a CEO. there will be a group of CEO (whales). Such a system may be a good Fintech company. but not a blockchain like Satoshi imagined. The ability to expand is an attribute that users can feel when interacting with the protocol. It is great to use the network with cheap and fast transactions.',\n",
       " ' Users love it. A decentralization is difficult to measure and users do not have the opportunity to contact it directly when sending transactions or using DEFI. So they tend to ignore it. This may be a long -term problem if we want people to own infrastructure to create new money or new banking systems. By choosing the network that everyone uses and the money they hold. they decide whether our future will be decentralized or still focused. Desiring profits can destroy decentralization. This is happening and we will see it in the next price increase. People want to ignore decentralized problems if the number increases. The decentralized network will only exist for fans or they will eventually win and defeat all VC projects. Believe in the victory of decentralization. As mentioned in the introduction. the ability to expand is mandatory. but not to pay for decentralized sacrifices. After 10 years of trying to let Bitcoin ETF approve. we finally achieved it. It happened exactly 15 years after Hal Finneys Tweet Running Bitcoin For pioneers. trust and use of crypto. this is a big day. They were vindicated. Bitcoin ETF is a achievement of Blockchain technology. The approval from the SEC legalized the entire crypto industry. ETF has a positive effect on crypto but also has some negative effects. the approved Bitcoin ETF also has a positive effect on Cardano and other blockchain projects. Many people consider the approval of Bitcoin ETF to open up opportunities for organizations to buy BTC. technology legalization is more important. Bitcoin is paving the way for the entire industry. I believe we will soon see more requirements for the ETF. SEC will most likely accept them. One of the biggest obstacles for the application of crypto is considered the unclear regulations and attitudes of different organizations. SEC has turned the green light for Bitcoin. which means that the efforts forbid it to stop. we are just talking about the United States. The United States is always the cradle of innovation. If one of the most important countries on the planet applies blockchain technology. other countries cannot observe. They will have to participate. SEC considers many Crypto projects as securities. We can expect that they will continue to fight against many different projects. this battle seems very disproportionate and unconvisious when considering the approved ETF fund. SEC is currently in a much more difficult situation. I hope it will be forced to approve more ETFs. Crypto projects will easily protect themselves in court if everything goes far to this level. We can see some unpleasant moves from SEC against Cardano and Crypto industry. But SEC is not the only organization in the US. Many authorities have repeatedly expressed disappointment with the SECs actions. SEC will have to be more careful in what you do. ETF requires trust in third party. Organizations may lie about the amount of money they hold or they may fail in a way. This is not suitable for Satoshis vision. The paradox is that this is a certain technological concentration that is supposed to bring a decentralization to the world.',\n",
       " ' ETF makes people investors and isolate them from Blockchain. Bitcoin ETF opens the door for organizations but has a neutral impact to negative from the perspective of application. people who are not interested in investment may not know what the word for abbreviation of ETF contains something. Organizations providing ETF should perform proof of reserve. using self -management wallets will be the priority choice of everyone. Cryptos mission is to create a system that does not depend on intermediaries that can abuse their position. That is still applied. Keeping BTC through ETF is a way for some people. but users should keep crypto in their self -management wallets. not sure just because of sovereignty and freedom but also for the ability to use the network and DEFI. This is not available to them via ETF. Cryptos success depends on the use of peer network networks and services. If people only see and use crypto as an investment property. I will consider it a missed opportunity. it will be enough for many people. It may even be suitable for banks because they will have to pay for crypto services and will not be threatened directly by blockchain technology. The reason is that many organizations only hold and trade crypto. It was a business for them. This is the beginning. An approved ETF fund can help us move forward in the long term. Blockchain will be used more to encode assets and build DEFI. Only at this time. the revolution really begins. USD token is active. And the problem is only the time before the property in other real worlds is token. Blackrock even released a report that wrote that tokenification is the future of the financial sector. The approved Bitcoin ETF will bring us closer to this. This may be a big step towards the replacement of old financial systems. Bitcoin ETF approved is evidence of Cryptos power and potential. It is the beginning of decline and application. Now people should think about what will happen next and where the crypto industry will come. Cardano is being built as a global financial and social operating system. The mission of the project has been known from the beginning and it will be easier now. Financial services on Blockchain may not be a service for those who accept early and technology enthusiasts. Immediately after more ETF funds were approved and the rules began to be completed. we can start discussing seriously about the mass application without being hindered by different authorities. Industry must continue. Everyone expects technology progress and more innovation from it. Bitcoin won many battles in its history. ETF has been waiting for a decade to be approved. This victory is very meaningful. Many people are happy. The celebration ends. must continue to build. For all groups. crypto organizations. fans and developers. it is the motivation for them to continue their efforts. The future seems bright. Some people think that the crypto industry does not need any ETF. They expect a revolution from Crypto without the participation of nations.',\n",
       " ' Some even want to replace central banks. These people may be a bit disappointed because Crypto is being institutionalized and received support from the states. Perhaps you cant do anything. It is a natural progress. These ambitious expectations can still be realized in the future. only the way will be different. A gradual evolution better than an unexpected revolution.January 5. Cardano blocks are usually full for longer. It may happen the case of Mem-Pool is full. users may not send transactions in the first test. The first generation applications were built on Plutus V1 ineffective. By choosing to use the Plutus V2 application instead of the Plutus V1 application. users can affect the number of transactions suitable for one block. they can contribute significantly to higher network pine. Plutus V1 is the first version of Plutus. introduced in HardFork Alonzo in September 2021. With this version. developers can start building the first applications for Cardano. All popular DEXs like Minswap. Sundaeswap and Wingriders are built on Plutus V1. Plutus V2 was introduced in HardFork Vasil in September 2022. Vasil includes the implementation of some important cips. Especially CIP-31. CIP-32 and CIP-33. These things have a significant impact on the effectiveness of smart contracts. Applications are created by Plutus V2 more effectively. especially from the perspective of storage. this has a positive impact on the network through the network. Users should prioritize the use of applications built on Plutus V2 because network resources are used more effectively. Briefly explain what Plutus V2 brings. In Plutus V1. the data is put into the output. They store and provide access to information on Blockchain. To access information in Datum. it is necessary to use the output that Datum is attached. This requires a reconcile output. This is a very effective approach. The addition of reference inputs in Plutus V2 (CIP-31) allows developers to view data without any additional steps. This facilitates access to information on the blockchain without spending and re -creating UTXO. Thanks to the reference input. applications can check the current state (locked value) effectively. On-chain data providers can store data at the output and this data can be referenced by other instructions (data consumers). The supplier only pays for one -time data storage and the data can be used by other instructions many times in a row. trading data is attached to the output in the form of hash function. With the deployment of the inchang (CIP-32). the developers can now create a set of instructions and attach the datum directly to the output instead of using their hash function. This simplifies the usage of days. Users can view actual data instead of providing that data to match the hash function. This helps simplify the communication of datum values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bbetween users. And the output may contain the hash or datum function. When an output has an inpatient datum. spending. spending transactions do not need to provide that datum. when spending one output is locked in the Plutus command. the instructions must be included in the spending transaction.',\n",
       " ' This increases the scale of the transaction and also causes a certain delay during processing. The reference command upgrade (CIP-33) allows developers to refer to the instructions without putting the instructions into each transaction. This significantly reduces the scale of transactions. improves the pine and reduces the cost of executing instructions. You only need to pay once to store the instructions in the blockchain and the instructions can be used (reference) many times. Transactions from Plutus V1 application occupy more significantly more space than transactions from the Plutus V2 application. The use of Plutus V1 applications reduces the network through the network because there is fewer transactions (less user operations) are classified as a block. about half of the smart contract transactions use Plutus V1. the other half uses Plutus V2. transactions from Plutus V1 app accounted for 90% of the block space. The use of Plutus V2 transactions has increased over time but has recently began to decline slightly. Newer applications are mostly built on Plutus V2. Many groups are moving their applications from Plutus V1 to Plutus V2. It is expected that the most popular applications will soon be on Plutus V2. The amount of transactions from the Plutus V2 application will most likely increase. Users can contribute to the higher pine of Cardano network by prioritizing Plutus V2 applications. They can also tell the groups that they ask to move the application to a newer version. If you want to know which version of the Plutus instructions is used by the application you are using. you can find out via Cexplorer in the DApps section. Find the application you are interested and then click on the command hash. A new window will open in which you will find the Plutus version. The Indigo protocol uses Plutus V2 (stable group command). It is good to know that the effective use of network resources not only affects the Plutus version but also affects the implementation of specific instructions. the scale of transactions from some DEX uses the same Plutus version may vary significantly. the Plutus version has a significant impact on the size of the transaction. The average trading scale from DEX using Plutus V2 may be 5 times smaller than the DEX using Plutus V1. In the most optimal case. it may be 10 times smaller. If all users start using the Plutus V2 application. the catheter of Cardano network may increase significantly. Maybe several times. Groups with applications running on Plutus V1 should switch to Plutus V2 as quickly as possible. This is effort. time and money. It will be necessary to perform the security of new instructions. Many groups have announced that they are moving. Users can use the applications they want. they should know the consequences if deciding to use an ineffective application. Especially if the network becomes congested. users can help significantly improve the pine of Cardano by making the right choice. Remember that the higher efficiency will lead to a lower fee. Cardano network was launched at the end of 2017.',\n",
       " ' So it will celebrate the seventh birthday this year. Cardano was mentioned as an academic project. it is one of the most decentralized networks with a strong community and developing ecosystems. Cardano is becoming stronger every year. What can we expect from the project in 2024? Look at the most important points. The most urgent problem for Cardano now is the absence of Stablecoin supported in USD. Instatible. TVL still develops even in these difficult conditions. Djed and Indigo can offset largely for the lack of Stablecoin supported in USD. people want an official stablecoin like USDT and USDC. We hope the Cardano community will see a stablecoin supported in USD by 2024. The USDA project of Emurgo has been suspended and we do not expect this project to continue. it would be an interesting surprise. Mehen Stablecoin (USDM) is expected to launch in December 2023. but the launch has been delayed until 2024. We believe that the second launch will succeed. IOG announced the recruitment of W. Sean Ford as the new CEO and David Markley as Deputy General Director for the new company focused on Stablecoin. We believe that in 2024 there will be a notice of the new Stablecoin prepared if not for its debut. There is a proposal in the Catalyst Fund11 will allow the original token tok token to program higher and bring this function closer to the tokens as we know from Ethereum. If the community votes for this project and the group has implemented. it may allow USDT and USDC to be taken to Cardano naturally (ie without crossing the bridge). It will be late. but in 2024 will probably witness a stablecoin supported in USD. At Summit Cardano 2023. people present the Midnight project the most. Another topic is Cardano Partnerchain Framwork (CPF). built on the basis of Parity. A pioneer program for developers has been implemented into Midnight. And it is possible to predict that Midnight will be launched in 2024. This is related to the Airdrop Token Dust that promised that the ADA holders will receive. Midnight is said to be the fourth generation blockchain with many improved features. From the beginning. there was a lot of speculation in the community about whether this project was Cardanos partner or rather a competitor. Now it seems it will be more like a partner. We still know very little about the framework of building a new series of partners. We only know that the framework has been used to build Midnight. We do not know if this frame is ready to issue for developers. We are expected to announce the release date will come in 2024. It will be an interesting surprise if this frame is released with Midnight. The new framework will bring Cardano closer to projects like Cosmos or Polkadot and may allow the development of new services. The decentralized EDI processing groups of large blockchains include Bitcoin. the group released the first tool to track the number of block manufacturers.',\n",
       " ' It would be great to see some more results. at least one part. A decentralized quality measurement is a complicated topic. EDI has been mentioned for a long time and is better if there is a specific comparison between some existing projects. at least in some items. Perhaps at the level of block manufacturers. if not at the project management level. The expansion ability is a large and necessary topic if we talk about application. The IOG group has worked on the input endorser for a long time. We do not expect to see the implementation in 2024. What we want to see is some major updates on the progress. roadmap or handover date. Charles Hoskinson talked about upgrading a part of POS consensus mechanism to increase the completion of transactions. It would be an interesting surprise to see this upgrade at least by 2024. The Hydra group is trying to study improvements that can allow at least one DEFI application to be applied and used more widely. Normal users do not currently use hydra. It will be great to see the reality of real hydra for a specific case. Example: From dex. The expansion ability is also involved in the optimization of smart contracts. using the new. more effective. more efficient V2 command version (V2). We hope that third -party groups will switch to newer versions (if not available) and the IOG group will continue to optimize. If the blocks are full for a longer time. this is an increasingly popular phenomenon. it is necessary to gradually increase the size of the block. If the demand for mass space. we can see that Cardano network is clogged by 2024. the problem can be solved quickly and effectively. but only at a certain limit. When the IOG group cannot increase the size of the block anymore. it is necessary to accelerate the development of Input Endorsers. promoting the use of hydra or community training on the use of Milkomeda. Some groups are working on Zero-Knowledge synthesis. such as Paima Studio. We hope at least one Zero-Knowledge synthesis on Cardano will be released in 2024. This can also improve expansion. The application of Cardano mainly depends on the success of the DEFI ecosystem. DEFI depends on developers. Developers depend on the capacity of the platform. documents. tools and funding. Full liquidity is also very important. this depends on the level of user acceptance and the security of the platform. Aiken defeated Plutus (Haskell) in a survey for the developer. This new programming language can attract new developers to the cardano platform. Although Plutus is still popular. it may be a difficult barrier to join for some programmers. We hope that by 2024 new applications are created through Aiken. Many projects improving infrastructure. tools and training support (and will) are funded by Catalyst. That is positive news. We expect the number of developers to increase by 2024. It can be said that DEFI has been successful until now if you look through TVL and the number of users.',\n",
       " ' The growth of TVL in the market price is an almost unique phenomenon on different DEFI ecosystems. Cardano even reached the top 10 at the end of 2023 according to TVL. This is an incredible achievement. in the larger context. DEFI on Cardano is still small compared to old projects. More than 53% of the total locked value in DEFI on all platforms locked in the Ethereum ecosystem. Although Ethereums market share is decreasing and reaching the lowest level of all time. about 49%. it is still a giant. Cardano was only 0. 72%. There is no smart contract foundation that can defeat the current king after only one night. A greater part is a slow process. like other smart contract platforms. are on the right track. The first steps have been done well. We expect that Cardano can reach the top 5 in 2024. The competition has a larger market share. but basically no. Polygon has a market share of 1. 6%. Avalanche 1. Optimism 1. 6%and Solana 2. It is important to note that TVL may not be a good sign for success. TVL is the number of users satisfied. Despite the correlation between the number of users and the TVL. the VC Fund can increase TVL in a fake way. The media and those who have special influence are interested in TVL. reaching the top 5 will be positive. But it is not good to consider it as a top priority of Cardano. We are sure that once we have Stablecoin supported in USD. TVL will grow significantly. There is no DEFI application hack in Cardano ecosystem. Many people think this is due to low TVL. A hack will definitely occur sooner or later. Cardano must maintain the state as a safe foundation. With a large number of hacks in other ecosystems. we can expect Cardano to maintain our reputation. we will witness the basic advances in ON-CHAIN. It is likely that Sanchnet will be completed and can be registered as Drep on the main network. ADA holders will be able to authorize ADA for Dreps. On-chain administration must be considered a global test that we do not have much experience. Responsibility for the project will gradually be transferred from groups to the community. Although everyone hopes to succeed. there are certain risks that come with it that can slow down the development process of the project. From the viewpoint of the management agencies. this is a necessary step. By burning the genesis key. the group will no longer be the owner of the protocol. This is mostly true today. but it is difficult to explain details for ordinary officials and people. Once the community is responsible for the project budget. changing the parameters and other things. it will be a clear signal to the world that IOG does not own Cardano even from the viewpoint of management. We have mentioned the most expected things in 2024. There will be many more things coming. There will be upgrades of protocols through the Hard-Fork complex.',\n",
       " ' The Mithril network will be more decentralized and will continue to grow. Many interesting DEFI projects will be launched. AXO has existed this month. Through funding from Catalyst. other groups will implement interesting projects. The event of half of Bitcoin is expected in April 2024. In the next year. the interest in Crypto often increases. leading to a large number of users and new capital. 2024 may still be a relatively quiet year. Cardano still has some time to prepare for the boom. history is not necessarily repeated. The increase in the user can start at the earliest by 2024. Cardano currently needs a stablecoin supported in USD. It can be said that the DEFI is relatively good for new users and will be better monthly.December 21. Crypto media is separated from the original characteristics of crypto. It is important to remember the tradition of Satoshi and realize how the blockchain industry has moved since he left. the community was completely different from today. The media hardly wrote about them. No report or analysis on-chain is published. Today we are filled with information about the crypto industry. the quality of information is poor and not interested in most decentralized fans. The crypto industry has become a money -making machine. Satoshi criticizes power in the hands of some intermediaries. often abused to disadvantage users. He wants to create a world in which people can choose the money and tools they want to use. If Satoshi can comment on todays crypto industry. he will probably be happy with the existence of a large number of blockchain and DEFI projects. I think he will be satisfied with the existence of POS and smart contracts. He dreamed of decentralized applications. And he may not be completely satisfied with the decentralized quality and self -respect of Bitcoin. Localism does not match Satoshis vision of the world. We dont know what he will think and today it doesnt matter. The blockchain industry is not only Bitcoin. We have many other related projects. I dare to say that the crypto industry mainly focuses on DEFI. I think this industry should stick to its original origin. Sticking to Satoshis vision and reminding the nature of the whole industry is essential to succeed and be applied. A public decentralized blockchain project must be built from the beginning. for humans for people. The community can agree on the tools and services they want to use for general financial interaction is important. The application of non -state money can only occur if a community starts to use it. The same thing is applied to financial instruments. What topics are important for this mission?. Letopole. self -management and application are much more important than Bitcoin ETF. half reduced. the presence of VC Fund. growth predictions or market prices. Crypto media mainly reports on topics that are not interesting. They are more interested in what someone says or the tokens they intend to buy rather than the number of users with self -management wallets.',\n",
       " ' They are more interested in market price chart rather than TVL analysis. The ability to approve an ETF Bitcoin ETF is a more important topic than Bitcoins increasing decline in decline. If you have similar views on important topics for the Crypto industry. you must be wondering why Cardano is not mentioned in Messaris annual report with views for 2024. How can I write about the thesis for 2024 in which should mention Stablecoin. Without paying attention to the success of the project from the top 10? So what can the report talk about?. Lets see the presentation of the projects in the report. Bitcoin is mentioned 178X. Ethereum 96x. Solana 65. Binance Chain 6X. Ripple 3X and Cardano 0x. Bitcoin has no stablecoin or DEFI. How can one talk about DEFI and innovation in the Bitcoin context? Bitcoin intentionally immune to major changes. Everyone knows that Ordinals. Inscribes and BRC-20 are like one (problem) to hack code rather than a desired innovation for many community members (including Core group members). Everyone has the right to have their own views on the future. Each person has a different perspective. experience and interests. I think that removing Cardano from the annual report is a mistake from the medias view if they have the ambition to provide information to readers fairly and objectively. When Messari tweeted reports on the X platform. the vast majority of comments asked where Cardano was. A large and powerful community spoke out. Other communities are not clearly visible. the Tweet line announced the issue of the Messari report had 1. 3 thousand likes and 360 re -posted. More than 100 comments (most of the Cardano sense?) From the Cardano community members (out of 400 comments). each comment has several hundred likes and dozens of re -posted. The posting with Cardano Whales comments has nearly 500 re -posted and 1. 7 thousand likes. This is more than Messaris original tweet. What does this say about the interest in the report?. This is a powerful signal that Messere has done something wrong. If the reaction with the report is like this. you cannot talk about the job done professionally. Ryan Selkis (CEO of Messari) publicly recognized that he advised friends to invest in Solana. Messari made a report for their own money. And this is the problem. We will return to that problem later. I definitely dont want to advise anyone to write about something. I think if you are a crypto expert. you should have some ideas on the topic that is important and can reflect the technological progress as well as the level of related blockchain projects. Especially the companies are in the top 10 according to the market capitalization because they are the most known. If the report refers to important topics for the crypto industry. I hope the authors will note this:. Maybe I am biased. I am a great supporter of Cardano. I think that if someone wrote about the thesis for 2024. they could not assume that Cardano would suddenly disappear from the world.',\n",
       " ' Cardano does not deserve to be mentioned in at least one topic related to the crypto industry? The report is not about decentralization. the number of hacks in DEFI or the community?. what is the meaning and purpose of the report? What is the target group?. Cardano was ignored by Messari and others. CoinDesk. Cointelegraph. Bankless and other organizations also reported negative or unfairly on this issue. That is the plan. It is about money. It is difficult for Crypto media to be objective and honest if someone owns or pays you. Money has a strong impact on information on the media. Localism can be accepted in the community. but certainly not in the case of the media agencies. The press must behave professionally. Cardano distributed Ada token in a fairly without the participation of VC funds and Crypto tycoon. Cardano is owned by the community. Both IOG and Cardano Foundation do not pay for the media to write positively about Cardano. The author of articles without any economic motivation or instructions from their bosses to positively write Cardano. Perhaps they are instructed to do the opposite and notice negative events. Maybe the media lacks Blockchain and DEFI technology experts. The Cardano community is big and strong enough to be known. We do not need to request support from the media about crypto. we must give our opinion about the quality of their work. Crypto media is a business like any other business. They may not even know what Crypto is. where they will come and what is important. They mainly want to make profits regardless of their article quality. The motivation and goals of the cardano community are different from the driving force and goals of the crypto media. The Cardano community is interested in decentralization and compliance with Satoshis initial ideals. Crypto media has left it. Crypto media can pretend to write about crypto but they dont care. They want to make money quickly. They do not care about decentralization. progress or application. Perhaps he didnt even write about it. That is why they turn Crypto into a tabloid newspaper. I come up with the idea that the media will tell you the tokens that VC is seeking to pour into you. There will be some facts in it. Ryal Selkis may be one of them. The cardano community may be sad because of the low press quality. its quite large and strong. this is the best marketing for the project. Everyone knows about us regardless of the media. What needs to be done? Just continue to build.December 20. All protocols of the Blockchain network need money to decentralize. BTC money acts as a reward for miners. ADA is used directly to decentralize Cardano. The local base needs protocol. The network consensus mechanism allows coins spending. The protocols can provide additional utilities for coins holders. Explain the relationship between local and protocols. Any open network must be able to encourage the economy of people to provide security and decentralization.',\n",
       " ' Coins are used to reward those who perform services that match the interests of the protocol. This is the main purpose of Coins. From the perspective of the protocol. the basic principle is as follows: Do the job I need and receive a fair reward from me. The individual protocols are different in many different details. POW miners have to buy expensive ASIC hardware and regularly pay for electricity consumption. BTC money plays a roles to make up for these costs. The operator sells BTC money and can continue business. They expect profits. That is the same principle as gold miners. They sold gold to cover the cost of employees and mining equipment. The exploitation tool provides security and decentralization of Bitcoin protocol. High hash ratio is necessary for security. the possibility that people can participate in the exploitation process at any time (and receive a reward). is necessary for decentralized process. A reward mechanism is different from Cardano. Participants have to buy ADA. They do not need to buy ASIC hardware and pay energy costs. ADA represents Cardano network ownership. Depending on the number of ADA. a certain owner owns. each owner is basically the owner at the proportion of Cardano. ADA is necessary to produce blocks. The owner of ADA can run the group (group that produces blocks) or authorize any existing group in the network. For this activity. the owner of ADA is entitled to receive rewards with ADA (Stake reward). The owner of ADA provides network security and decentralization. And things are similar to Bitcoins case. They have to hold ADA. a scarce resource (with a limited supply of supply). This ensures that the market price will be different. Each Owner ADA decentralized Cardano is similar to the bitcoin mining tools. Stake reward is a direct economic driving force to hold ADA. Unlike BTC. ADA has cash flow. The higher the number of operators or Stake people. the more concentrated the protocol. it should be mentioned that both hash and coins can focus on rich entities. The protocols use coins to receive rewards. the local rates may have other (secondary) purposes. The scale can be very wide and are subjective to people subjective. Coins can be used as a place to store values. money. administrative coins. utility coins (network usage fees). an expensive resource for decentralized network. Coinss market price must be high because their value is directly related to the protection from the 51% attack on the internet. the protocol cannot affect the market price and must rely on the behavior of those who affect the supply and demand of coins. It is important to realize that people are aware and use coins for a purpose that is different from the purpose that the protocol uses them. It is people who decide whether some coins are valuable. only people decide how to use money. Coins are the numbers stated in the ledger. If you forget the existence of the protocol for a moment. you will find that you cant do anything with this money besides keeping them.',\n",
       " ' Coins cannot be used without protocols. Without transactions. not even receiving money. Coins are provided by the protocol. The capabilities and attributes of the protocol determine how and the purpose of using coins. money needs a protocol to survive. Coinss utility itself is very limited. In the extreme case. the utility is limited to Coins Hodl. people believe that Coinss market price will be preserved over time or even increased. The protocol increases the utility of coins. The basic utility that users need to get money and can send them to others is the ability to create and send transactions. the quality of the trading network is higher (namely we are talking about the ability to expand). it will be more useful for users. Coins will be more helpful. The ability to deposit money quickly. cheap and between a large number of users increases the so -called network effects of the protocol. The more users can use the protocol. the higher its financial and social value. The main purpose of Coins. from the viewpoint of the protocols. is the ability to reward participants. Coins will (sooner or later) reflect the utility provided by the protocol. The value of coins will reflect the size of the network effect. Network effects can be directly and indirectly. Human beliefs. such as religion. are considered an indirect network effect. People do not need to interact much with each other. a certain religion may have significant social significance. HODL narration can be considered an indirect network effect. Hodlers communication takes place on social networks (modern church). but not through the protocol itself. The network effect is directly based on the ability of users to interact with each other. The banking system and social networks are examples of network effects directly from the Internet world. A good expansion protocol will have a chance to win a larger market share than the protocol that can expand less. A higher expansion network will be more useful. The ability to expand is not necessarily bound to the protocol (layer 1) but also with the entire ecosystem (layer 2). the expansion of layer 2 always depends on a certain extent on the extended ability of layer 1. The image below shows two different expansion protocols. The expansion ability has a direct impact on the development of the network effect. Instead of expanding. you can imagine any other features that users can feel. a decentralized. DEFI or may also be an indirect network effect. the belief in the markets market capitalization growth. The social and financial importance of the protocol. its network effect. is a combination of many different attributes. Not only technical aspects are also important but also Lindy effects. this topic is not related to the mutual relationship between coins and protocols so we will not mention it. The only utility of the protocol is not necessarily the transaction network. Cardano is a smart contract platform. the utility of the cardano protocol is higher than Bitcoin. representing the first generation of Blockchain.',\n",
       " ' The higher utility of the cardano protocol affects the utility and demand for the original ADA. Why? Because users can do more work with the ADA copper. Other original coins can be cast on Cardano. Cardano allows third parties to build and deploy applications. These applications add additional utilities on the transaction network. On Cardano network. NFT can be created or users can send each other encrypted assets. such as dollars. it is possible to create many different applications that can regenerate financial services. For example: Exchange or lending protocol. Ada holders can hold Coins. but they can do many other things. If the protocol tools are useful for someone. Coins is also more useful. The utilities of the protocol increase the network effect and the need for coins. Original coins (ADA and BTC) of protocols acting as utility coins. they need to pay the protocol fee. Fees representing the income of the protocol. If the interest in the use of Cardano network increases. the demand for ADA is necessarily increasing because users have to pay to use with ADA. ADA is a natural currency in the Cardano ecosystem. As the utility of the protocol increases. the value of Coins ADA will increase naturally. It is important to note that users use money through the protocol. Blockchain wallet interacts with the protocol. The protocol provides utilities for Coins. Please prove that with an example. ADA can be used as collateral. Stablecoin is mortgaged exceeding the DJED algorithm is an example of the use of ADA as collateral. ADA is used as an expensive digital resource to cast Stablecoin DJED. Djed protocol tries to stabilize the value of Coins DJED to match the value of the USD. Note that the DJED demand increases the number of ADA locked in the DJED protocol. Djed protocol is an utility that increases the demand for ADA. Users can use Stablecoin DJED. helping to increase the utility of the ecosystem (financial stability is very useful in a decentralized world) and therefore the utility of the cardano protocol. I believe there is a positive relationship between utility and value. What is more useful of course is more valuable. People decide what is useful for them and what they want to use. Just keeping the money in your wallet may be helpful. if you can use it. it is an additional utility that adds to value. The protocol (layer 1) is not necessarily the protocol provides additional utilities for Coins. Coins can be used in the second layer (layer 2). in DEFI or even in centralized services. Keeping the indigenous on a centralized exchange can be considered a utility (speculation of value growth). Sending BTC via Paypal can also be considered a utility (although it does not fit the decentralized and self -management principle). The crypto industry is reaching the stage. even using the coins or coins of a protocol in another protocol. BTC can be used in Ethereum and Cardano ecosystems. The utility of BTC money can be increased through other blockchain.',\n",
       " ' Think whether the large amount of BTC is locked in the Cardano ecosystem can affect ADAs market price. I only focus on the direct relationship between the protocol and the coins. the topic is more complicated and more expressive. I will take an example. Do people consider decentralized as a utility? Although decentralized is a major feature of the blockchain industry. people do not feel this feature when using the protocol. What they found is the ability to expand. So is the decentralization important? In my opinion. thats right. because the concentration gradually leads to abuse of power. Power may be abused by a group. who operates the Pool dominated or the dominated miners (Stake). potential risks may never come true. Continuing this review will be for another article. It is important to understand that a blockchain has no principal. it cannot be decentralized because if nothing is used to reward participants. there must be some centralized management forms. The protocol directly affects Coins utilities with their characteristics and abilities. More useful is more valuable. Both holding and using coins may be valid for users. More options for users will increase the value appropriately. Security is a comprehensive topic. It includes protection against the creation of new exterior tokens. consensus protocol. immutability of ledger. transaction security. self -management of assets. Sybil attacks. against various attacks. management and security budgets. Blockchain is a complex system in which some components are based on the security of other components. The dependence is sometimes unclear at first sight. This article is aimed at indicating the beginning of the scope of the topic and inspires them to study more deeply. We will not go into details. Many topics are detailed in our old articles. The goal is for readers to understand that security not only has a topic (51%attack) and need to think about it comprehensively. People must trust the system they choose to use. They have certain expectations and they must be met. The relationship between security and trust is basic and symbiotic. The security mechanisms are essential to establish and maintain the trust between users and the system that participants agree on the network and the group belongs to. Everyone uses the network through Blockchain wallet. They must realize that they believe in the software (protocol) maintained by the group. there may be many different forms. in this type. users trust all the participants. ie block producers and/or authorize an expensive resource (for example. ADA for the Cardano group or the hash ratio for the bitcoin group). It can be said that the user believes that the network is decentralized. As you will see in the back of the text. security often depends on decentralization. What are peoples expectations?. Users expectations are based on articles and public information on the media. If the expectation is not met or a serious incident occurs. we can talk about security violations. One of the most powerful stories that are circulated about blockchain technology is not (or easy) to change the blockchain monetary policy or create a new token naturally.',\n",
       " ' people believe that if they use their own management wallets. no one in the world can steal their property. change the balance or prevent them from eliminating property. They and they can only use their assets through transactions. Token can be used at any time. So the network never stops working. Blockchain network must be strong and can resist different attacks. No one can freeze user accounts. create invalid transactions that allow money transfer to other addresses (no valid signature of the owner) or increase the amount of money. The usability of the network is related to long -term economic sustainability. Participants must be financially rewarded when working for the network. This means security depends on monetary policy and reward mechanism. Summarize. Security requirements are placed above:. security is a complicated topic. If only one of the points is mentioned somehow does not work. unreliable or reduced. the users property will be threatened in a way. This does not necessarily mean they can lose property. that means they may face many different limitations when using the network or someone has achieved benefits (priority for transactions. attacks. so the fairness or correctness is not guaranteed. More points can be added to the above list. clear regulations and self -management rights (there are many attacks on users). The self -management of assets related to users rather than Blockchain itself. That is why the topic is not mentioned. So another wide topic may be security related to the use of DEFI service. We will not mention the topic in this article. Give some examples that threaten the security of blockchain. A pool may try to change rules. not correct errors or accidentally make new errors. All workstations may contain errors (most likely. but may not express itself). Participants can begin to behave dishonestly (censoring transactions. creating empty blocks. If the number of producers is low (a small number occupies the dominant position). their dishonest acts may have a great impact on the network. Low decentralization can lead to an offensive from the outside or internal (DDOS attack. trying to affect the pool or the participants in agreement). Participants can leave the network if they are not paid. When you ask people what blockchain security is. they often say that it is the ability to resist the so -called 51%attack. This attack is a significant security threat to decentralization. The attack is aimed at the network consensus mechanism. which is aimed at the manufacturers of the block and the holder of expensive resources necessary for decentralization. It occurs when a single entity or pool gains more than half of the network (stake) or calculated power (hash speed). It is not necessarily an offensive from the outside. in which the opponent tries to get more expensive multi -resources than those who are honest. The abuse of internal power of the dominant consensus participants may occur. The level of high control weakens the basic decentralized principle in the Blockchain. designed to prevent any party with too much influence on the internet.',\n",
       " ' One can talk about a attack on the reputation of Blockchain. more than 55% of the blocks are only exploited by 2 pools dominated. Theoretically risk that these two participants will cooperate in a internal attack. but that may never happen. Risks are not a binary variable but a scale. Suppose the attacker gained dominance to the consent mechanism of the network. he could rewrite the history of Blockchain. spend with one token twice (attacking spending twice). censoring transactions. preventing other participants from receiving rewards. Details may vary for each blockchain. Even if the attacker gained 51% of the blockchain online control. they could not directly steal the users money. This is due to the security of each wallet and locking the security code they are not infringed by the 51%attack. Although the 51% attack allows attackers to manipulate blockchain in certain ways. it does not give them the ability to create transactions on behalf of users or change the wallet balance. The attacker can only affect the transactions they have sent. Note that security depends on decentralization. As decreasing decreases. the risk of attack increases. If you can gain an advantage in holding an expensive resource. you can attack your cyber. Cardanos decentralization is one of the highest decentralized levels in the field of crypto. with thousands of pool operating and 1. 3 million Stake people. the possibility of a 51% attack seems unlikely. an online attack is always ready to invest a large amount of money to buy an expensive resource or come up with the idea of \\\\u200b\\\\u200bhow to get resources fraud from the current holders. The ability to perform an attack of 51% is an inherent feature of the public blockchain. The only way to prevent is the high cost or the complexity of the implementation of an attack. A decentralized blockchain protection not only against the 51% attack but also against different cyber attacks such as DDOS attacks. A decentralized network must not have the so -called only ventricular point. This will be a point in the network that can cause problems if the attacker controls or disabled it successfully. If the network has a large number of pools. it is difficult to attack the network because the attack must be done simultaneously on multiple nodes at the same time. the network must be able to resist the ledger history. it is necessary to ensure the consistency of data between nodes. A decentralized enhancement of security by distributing data on multiple nodes (ledger is a decentralized database). This makes it difficult for toxic agents to violate the entire network because they need to attack simultaneously a significant part of the nodes. The integrity of blockchain is maintained through coding and blocks of blocks. The attacker cannot change past transactions that have been confirmed and put into Blockchain. This will require the ability to create a series of alternative frauds for all previous blocks from a certain time in the past to the latest block. This is not possible without the advantage of owning an expensive resource.',\n",
       " ' As shown in the previous paragraph. high decentralization increases the ability to resist the censorship of the network. The more block manufacturers who make autonomy about which transactions will be put into the new block. the greater the possibility of censorship will not occur. some block manufacturers can start censoring transactions. If their number is low (their shares or ratio will be low). their behavior will not significantly threaten the overall function of the network. the desire is not only a large number of block manufacturers in the network but also a large number of people who trust an expensive resource. If the transactions are successfully censored in the network. it will violate security because some users will not be able to eliminate assets (in their opinion. the property will be worthless). The decentralized nature of the consensus mechanism is very important in the context of rewriting network rules. it is impossible to change the monetary policy of the protocol. creating new money from the air. it is impossible to change the behavior of the workstation even in the sense that can freeze the user account or change their balance. The development group has identified the behavior of the workstation and performs it. The source code can be found on GitHub. So it is provided for free for everyone in the world. Blockchain projects are transparent in behavior. it is necessary to make sure that the attacker or the group cannot easily change that behavior. It is impossible to arbitrarily change the initial regulations but must correct the error. The protocol rules are written in the source code of the workstation. All operators in the network decide which version they will run. The attacker has no chance to install a scam workstation app on all operators. Assuming that all honest participants in the consensus mechanism will run a workstation version with rules in accordance with the communitys expectations and they have the right to dominate. the attacker does not have the opportunity to change the protocol rules. It is impossible to transfer money without a valid signature (this is the initial rule of the workstation). If an invalid transaction is inserted into the block. that block will not be valid. Such blocks will be removed by honest nodes in the network. The consensus mechanism of the monetary policy protection network is not allowed to create an unexpected token through a transaction. Users expect the system to ensure the immutability of monetary policy and cannot manipulate their assets. This is guaranteed through decentralized and password. If the user uses a self -deposited wallet. their money will be well protected. Even when the Blockchain network stopped for a while and then restarted. users still own their money and tokens. the Solana network had to restart many times. No one lost property. if the group develops and the manufacturer agrees to each other that. they will eliminate 10 blocks. the property may be lost (the history of changing the deleted transaction). That is why Blockchain network is built in an inseparable way (continuity/vividness).',\n",
       " ' Even if some offline nodes. the remaining nodes in the network can continue to operate positively on the basis of consensus. the consensus mechanism of the network is different. Some like life. others like accuracy. Sudden turning off the network can only occur in the case of some software errors. Cardano network has never stopped since its launch. This is true for most other projects. From the users point of view. the existence of coins and tokens is not so important. but mainly the ability to move them to another address so they can spend. Users can hold their properties in their wallets through code secrets (passwords). this secret cannot be shared with others in a way to ensure exclusive ownership. Anyone who knows the secret is the owner of Token. Users depend on the ability to process the transaction of the network. bring it to a new block and add the block to the blockchain safely. Blockchain transactions are the only way that the initial owner of the property can transfer ownership (control) token to others. The new owner will have monopoly control over tokens. So the network must be available. it must exist. this is not a certain thing. The existence of the network depends on the ability to cover operating costs. The last topic we will mention is the security budget and the ability to pay consensus for the participants of the network. it is not an attack conducted by a third party to get rich by fraud (double spending attack) or reduce blockchains reputation. This may be the result of the security budget that is increasingly narrowed. The problem is easy to explain on POW networks like Bitcoin. The POW network needs to consume a huge amount of electricity for calculation power (hash speed). The cost of Bitcoins operation will be paid by miners. The exploitation receives a new BTC from the Bitcoin protocol for each exploited block. The problem is that the number of BTC coins is limited to 21 million and is more than 19. 5 million VND is being circulated. BTC money is gradually exhausting reserves. With each half reduction. taking place every 4 years. the BTC reward for each block will be reduced. Maintaining the same (or higher) hash ratio is based on the assumption that the network will collect a large amount of fee and market price of BTC money will continue to increase. the operator will receive a smaller reward. which will lead to a decrease in hash rates. which is reduced security. Reducing security levels means cheaper when performing a 51%attack. The stream of leaving people can lead to decreasing decrease in decline. the long -term existence of the Blockchain network is based on many assumptions and is not guaranteed. Cardano and many other blockchain networks basically face the same problem. The POS network has the advantage of being cheaper (operating costs lower than 99%). Cardano will only issue 45 billion ADA into circulation. There are less than 9 billion ADA in reserves.',\n",
       " ' when Cardano reserves are exhausted. it will be enough to reward Spo and Stake. The security budget is very dangerous for users in that it is difficult to estimate the future development. The risk can increase gradually and theoretically is very slow. the 51% attack may occur unexpectedly. we focus on topics that are not often controversial in the context of security and newcomers even often unknown (in our experience). The article does not include all topics and details. The goal is to let beginners see the scope of this topic and show them the right direction in their learning process. Good news is that most of the attacks do not lead to the loss of users property. If the user uses a self -managed wallet and can protect the secret code (password cluster). it is almost certain that they will not lose property. As explained in the article. what users must care about is the ability to spend property. Charles Hoskinson said in A Ama a long time ago that solving problems with full blocks was a very good problem. It is evidence that people are using the network. Some DEFI projects have been waiting for a long time to be released. The number of users and thus trading is increasing. With the appearance of the price market. the operation will increase even more. Now the blocks are almost full. What can we expect next year? There will be network congestion? Fortunately. not only short -term solutions but also long -term solutions. With positive psychology in the market. users activities are also increasing. People send property and use the DEFI application more often. It leads to higher network load. This is definitely a very positive trend as long as the management network to handle all transactions on time. When the network is blocked. the user experience will decrease. you can see the blocks at the time of writing this article. Almost all blocks are full. One of them even from 99%. Up to 50 transactions in some blocks. This is not a situation that will last permanently. The demand for online trading is slowing down. Not all blocks are full. In recent days. the usage of network capacity has reached 60 to 70%. Cardano has not yet been able to handle all user transactions in the next block (or some blocks). this may change. Explain what happens when the blocks are full. explain what the market fee is. This concept was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. So it has appeared since Bitcoin was born. Market fee is a system that adjusts the need for one block. Roughly. if the number of transactions is low. the fee is also low. All the waiting transactions in Mem-Pool can be inserted into the next new block. Pool operators (formerly miner) choose to transact to insert into the new block. They choose at the fee. They have economic engines to bring transactions with the highest fee in the bloc because the block exploitation group also receives all fees.',\n",
       " ' Pool operations compete with each other to see who will exploit the block. as well as who will receive the biggest reward for transactions. Lowering transactions will have to wait longer in Mem-Pool. Why? Let me explain. If the user wants to quickly send a Bitcoin transaction and want to make sure that the transaction will be included in the next block. he must set the almost highest fee of the 4.000 other transactions with the highest fee. A Bitcoin block may contain about 4. Users are forced to pay more money (struggle) to get a position in the block. the Bitcoin transaction fee is 63 USD. Users must study mem-pool to estimate the fee. If he set the highest fee. ie 65 USD. he is very sure that the pool operations will put his transaction in the next block. Low-paying transactions ($ 30 fees) may stay in Mem-Pool for a few days. If the demand for transactions is high. the number of transactions in Mem-Pool will continue to increase. Once the fee is too high. the need may decrease. Users are sending fewer new transactions. Pool operators will start inserting old transactions for smaller fees into the block. The number of transactions in Mem-Pool will begin to decrease. There are currently nearly 300.000 transactions in Mem-Pool Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be able to handle all transactions for about half a day. but only if the new user does not send any new transactions. Cardano does not use the concept of market fee. For 200 -byte transactions. users always pay 0. 1642 ADA. Loading the network. the demand for transactions. not related to charging. Cardano cannot adjust trading needs through the natural market mechanism. Cardanos mem-pool works different from Bitcoins mem-pool. as its size is limited to double the size of the block. Immediately after mem-pool on a specific node is filled. that node will not accept new transactions (it stops inserting transactions into mem-pool). maybe the Pool operator decides to increase the capacity of Mem-Pool on his node. the transaction is not accepted. Users can try to send the next transaction. This system has the advantage that users can see immediately the transaction will not be processed. They can decide whether their transactions are urgent enough to try to send back or not or they can wait. Users compete with each other to bring transactions into mem-pool through a number of trials to send the next transaction. It is important to mention that this situation does not occur in recent days. Unlike Bitcoin. Cardano still processes all relatively fast transactions. this may change at any time if the demand increases. Cardanos mem-pool fills quite quickly when the demand starts to increase. Both Bitcoins market fee as well as the operations of Cardano network are not optimal. Both networks cannot meet high trading needs. Ethereum is also in the same situation with 180.000 transactions waiting in Mem-Pool. In the top 10. only Binance Chain. Ripple. Solana and Avalanche can meet high trading volume.',\n",
       " ' the demand for transactions (block space) is different between projects. Almost every good decentralized blockchain has its limits and can be blocked. Ideal if blockchain can handle multiple transactions on demand. The Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are currently not handled. Cardano can join them soon. The IOG group can react to the current situation by increasing the block size or reducing the block time. both parameters can be modified. The block size has been increased many times in the past. Cardano used to fall into the situation where users had to send the transaction back. Increasing block size should only be done after careful consideration. as the larger block size will extend its diffusion time in the network. This is an unwanted situation. because the separation (FORK) of Blockchain can occur more often. As part of the Input Endorser. the development team thinks that the blocking time of the block has the longest casting frequency will be 15 seconds. And theoretically can reduce blocking time right now if necessary. Both modified increased the number of transactions that Cardano could handle in an era. The IOG group monitors the network and knows what adjustments can be made. I dare to say that both adjustments can be done at this time. at the same time. the transaction demand may be higher than the ability to increase the current capacity of the network. The adjustment may not meet the needs and cardano may be blocked. It is necessary to solve the problem from a long -term perspective and provide solutions to significantly increase network capacity. Input endorser is the most ambitious solution that can increase the number of transactions processed every second to a few hundred to thousands (ignore that TPS is not a suitable measure for Cardano). this solution is relatively far away. Perhaps we will not see that in this growth market. Another solution is Hydra. This is the Layer 2 solution similar to Lightning Network. We can expect Hydra to debut before Input Endorsers. People want to use DEFI applications. Hydra must be integrated with applications. ideally in a way that users can hardly know about it. This is still a big challenge. If at least one DEX uses hydra in the next price increase market. it will be the reason to celebrate. The Sundaeswap group presented the Demo using Hydra. So this is probably the farthest demo in the implementation process. Cardano will have a system similar to the market fee. The solution is called a pricing by rank. Pricing by levels is based on the assumption that users have different expectations for each transaction on fees and latency (priority) when put into the block. Some are willing to pay more money for their transactions to be put into block as quickly as possible. while others prefer to pay less and are willing to wait longer. The valuation paper according to each level proposes to divide the block space into all levels. Each step will have different lag and payment fee.',\n",
       " ' The number of steps along with the delay and fee at each step will be automatically adjusted depending on the current needs. Pricing by levels does not increase the capacity (pine) of the network but makes the network more fair for the poor and the rich. The market fee of Bitcoin makes the network can only be used for the rich if it is blocked. Pricing at each level maintains decisive and fixed fees. but adds the ability to prioritize emergency transactions and pay more money to resolve quickly. These described solutions are not necessarily the final solution for Cardanos expansion. More improvements can come in the future if needed. In the context of the upcoming growth market. it is expected that by 2025. short -term solutions are needed. DEFI groups can consider using Hydra. it is possible that the hydra group needs to complete some functions to turn this into reality. Having a full block is a good problem. but it needs to be solved. it is important not to sacrifice decentralized. This is often forgotten. There are blockchains that can be expanded very well but have to pay for decentralization. For some users as well as third -party groups. this is a favorite solution. Not everyone wants the most decentralized solution as possible. The difference between Bitcoin and Cardano is the IOG group trying to address the ability to expand Layer 1. Although Bitcoin is more or less remains the same for many years to come. Cardano will still be the leader in innovation. This is the biggest difference between projects and community expectations. The Cardano communitys expectation is that Cardano will bring a decentralization to all those who need it. especially those who need it the most. The Bitcoin community has no plans to change the basic layer 1. The higher expansion ability should only be given through Layer 2 or even through monitoring solutions. One of the stories about Bitcoin is that online transactions will only be for the rich (maybe only for banks and organizations). this is not the right way. If we are forced to divide the first -class citizens and second -class citizens. we will have to recognize that decentralization does not solve the problem. A decentralization must be able to access to everyone. This is exactly why we need more blockchain with different trade -offs. Lock solutions are not for us. The mission of the Cardano project is to bring decentralization to everyone. This may sound like a phrase that every blockchain project can use. The fact that there are not many blockchain ecosystems can bring decentralization to everyone. With the increasing Bitcoin transaction fees. the debate is that on-chain transactions will only be suitable for the rich of the rich. While first -class citizens can enjoy the benefits of decentralization. second -class citizens will have fewer decentralized solutions or even guardian solutions. If we are satisfied with the idea of \\\\u200b\\\\u200bthis future. Blockchain technology will fail because it does not solve any problems.',\n",
       " ' A decentralization will increase with the number of blockchain in the crypto industry. If you are self -respectful. you will find that you can achieve high acceptance and become a strong change for traditional financial institutions. it is important to say that building a global decentralized blockchain can expand adequately as a technological challenge for each development group. What is considered to be satisfactory expansion? This may be difficult to answer. We need some contexts. people make hundreds of millions of digital financial transactions. about 150 million credit card transactions take place daily (1.739 TX per second). 40 million transactions daily take place through Paypal (462 TX per second). About 660 million visa transactions take place globally every day (7.638 TX per second). The current financial system can be paid quickly. When paying by card. payment may only take a few seconds with relatively high reliability. Blockchain network does not have the opportunity to compete with financial systems on TPS and payment speed. Blockchain network is more suitable for financial services (DEFI) rather than payment. it is possible to try to build a less decentralized blockchain to pay. Blockchain projects have decentralized and different expansion capabilities. Expansion can be measured through the number of transactions that the system can handle every second (this data is not suitable for Cardano. but we can ignore it in this article). Bitcoin can handle less than 10 transactions per second (about 7 TPS). Cardanos TPS is about 20 (block size is 90.112 bytes. 20 seconds). Ethereum is similar (about 15 TPS). Bitcoin will not have better scale in the first layer (layer 1). The expansion ability will be resolved with Lightning Network (LN). the second layer (layer 2). Ethereum will expand the scale mainly through the Layer 2 network. The IOG group plans to improve the expansion of layer 2. and they are working on the Layer 2 network (for example. we have Milkomeda). Some projects can handle hundreds to thousands of transactions per second. For example: Ripple. These projects do not need the second class. they are able to meet the needs of the real world. We can check the quality of decentralized processes and argue that high TPS projects usually only bring expansion. not decentralized capabilities. In the context of the article. we can call such projects that are unsatisfactory. because we want to be freticed available to everyone. not a network that can be expanded. that may not be fair. We will have to carefully check the quality of decentralization. This can be quite subjective. because there is no unified view of exactly what is high quality decentralized blockchain. we want to consider this topic from philosophical views rather than technical perspectives. And say that all the mentioned projects are more or less decentralized. The global application requires expansion in the order of thousands of TPS. The ability to expand in the order of tens to hundreds of TPS may not be enough. talking about the ecosystem instead of just about the blockchain project is reasonable.',\n",
       " ' Blockchain can be the center of an ecosystem where the networks and other applications will appear. A typical example is Bitcoin and Lightning Network. in addition to Cardano and Hydra. Cardano also brought this concept further through the partnerchain. Ethereum is basically a ecosystem with the most Layer 2. Ethereum is significantly more decentralized than all layers 2 (some layers 2 are basically concentrated). The core of the ecosystem. will be the most decentralized. Additional networks and applications in the ecosystem will expand the scale better at less decentralized costs. for blockchain projects priority than TPS rather than decentralization. this is not applicable. We can consider these blockchain as a good payment network but little focus on quality decentralization. This does not mean that only Cardano. Ethereum and Bitcoin projects try to be decentralized and other projects are not. All projects can (and should) strive for better decentralization. What we want to say is the technological limitations naturally create different levels of decentralization in the ecosystem. This can be understood as a decentralized service as a scarce service. so it can be expensive and monopoly. The monopoly can (and will) be considered as unfairness in the system. Only the rich can have economic capability to perform online transactions. while the poor will become a second -class citizen depending on the less decentralized services. Often they will even be forced to use the locking service. The problem is that this conflict directly with the principles of the blockchain industry. A decentralization to free us from the intermediaries. It is meaningless when we build a system in which intermediaries still serve the poor. Such a system will not solve any problems that Blockchain can solve. If we do not guarantee the comprehensive and fairness of everyone. the whole industry will no longer make sense. Layer 1 network must be the highest decentralization in the ecosystem. but all layers 2 still have to be decentralized well. most people can perform online transactions over time. which is to use layer 1. Remind you that if you want to use LN. you must first send (and pay) an online transaction to open the LN channel for you. The LN channel does not exist forever and sometimes needs to close it (and open another new channel). The comprehensive and function of LN largely depends directly on the expansion of the Bitcoin protocol. Some Bitcoin players believe that Bitcoin on-chain transactions will be only for the rich and those who accept it soon. not for newcomers. Online transactions may only be used by banks and organizations. Not ordinary people. I dare to say that if someone believes in this. and thinks that Bitcoin can succeed in his mission. he does not understand that people do not want to become a second -class citizen. One of the reasons for the application of crypto is to ensure better fairness. the intermediary cannot abuse power. If there are intermediaries in the new system (seemingly better). this system will fail from time to time for similar reasons as the current system.',\n",
       " ' I will give an example. Through Blockchain. the number of coins and tokens in circulation must always be verified. including the owner of them at any time. If there are monitoring solutions in the ecosystem. this cannot be guaranteed. More precisely. the system will not be able to protect the property from being stolen by intermediaries. Users are not faced with choosing to use monitoring services or completely not using the system. Some Bitcoiner says that LN monitoring is a good solution. they are not like that. If everyone is forced to send BTC to third parties. it is a loss from a decentralized perspective. Third party can steal all customer information. BTC token. Token may be stolen by hackers or confiscated by competent authorities. Didnt we want to build a completely opposite system. where this will not be done?. Bitcoin ecosystem cannot provide decentralization for everyone. This is also obvious in mathematics. If all Bitcoin blocks only have transactions related to the opening of LN channels and nothing else. only 500.000 users can participate in LN. It is about 200 million people per year. To receive 1 billion people will take 5 years. it is necessary to use the Bitcoin protocol for normal transactions. including closing existing ln channels. If only a quarter of the bitcoin block size is used for beginners. only 50 million can be put into use in a year. receiving 1 billion people may take 20 years. Bitcoin has inscriptions. Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Other new technologies may appear. LN transactions will compete for block space with other transactions with other purposes. If you remove the self -respectful glass. you will find that it will benefit the crypto industry if people accept the existence of many blockchains. A decentralization will be more accessible to more economically for more people if there are more blockchains that exist more. it will accelerate the application. A ecosystem has no chance to succeed and defeat all other ecosystems unless it is a priority blockchain than TPS rather than decentralized. I remember 2017. Bitcoin trading is very expensive ($ 50 or more). The settlement takes many days. People often say that Bitcoin does not work because they have sent a transaction and it has not been resolved. Some even thought they were tricked. People want to sell BTC on the exchange but they cannot because their trading has to wait for many days in Mem-Pool. Many people choose not to use self -management wallets. They like to hold crypto assets on CEX (centralized exchange) because they can sell and buy them quickly. Some people have changed their views because they understand that holding property on CEX during the price market is very dangerous. Some may have understood the meaning of decentralization and doing so for ideological reasons. most Crypto holders still do not use self -management wallets. they cannot use LN and Defi. I dare to say this is one of the reasons for the slow application. Low expansion capabilities force people to use depository solutions instead of decentralized solutions.',\n",
       " ' Will we repeat the same mistake in the market price to the next?. First of all we must have advanced technology. we have to objective about what the ecosystem can be handled and what it cannot. Self -respectfulism hinders the application. A decentralization is a top priority. The second is the comprehensive and fairness. the available decentralization. Correction of decentralization is proportional to the expansion ability. If a system is not able to expand. we need to connect multiple systems. Bitcoin worshipism was born from the belief that people had to use a monetary system and it was BTC. it was forgotten that the ability to pay for the economic decentralization was an important issue equal. if not more important than the existence of good tokens. If Blockchain technology does not allow anyone in the world to use the self -governing wallet of a relatively good decentralized network. society will not undergo the basic financial and social transformation process as expected from this industry. Bitcoin ecosystem has no decentralized chance for everyone on the planet. Receiving only 10% of the population will probably take several decades. We are talking about the current technological status (we ignore the next development possible). Cardano is one of the most decentralized blockchains in the Crypto industry (probably the most decentralized blockchain in the top 10) with a plan to increase expansion. Cardano ecosystem will not only have DEFI but also have a payment network. Perhaps one of the payment networks will be Hydra. I dare to say that Cardano may be a suitable solution for many people who love decentralization in the future. BTC on Cardano can be a better option than the CEX wallet or monitoring LN wallet from a decentralized point of view. Stop saying that online transactions will only be for the rich. look for solutions so that everyone can buy it.December 6. Through the exploitation. only 21 million BTC will be issued by Bitcoin protocol in circulation. BTC money is scarce in digital. this feature is not only available in Bitcoin. Creating digital scarcity is a concept that is easily copied. Through Stake. ADA is in digital scarcity. What about Token and NFT? In this article. we will explain what digital scarcity is and what it depends on what. The digital scarcity refers to the limit that can verify and enforce the source of digital assets through the use of blockchain technology. based on decentralized and decentralized software. This ensures that the property cannot be copied or fake. maintaining its value and uniqueness. Digital scarcity can be compared to a type of monetary policy because Blockchain controls the provision of local. unlike the traditional monetary policy managed by the central bank. the digital scarcity is dominated by decentralized protocols and immutable codes on the blockchain. This means that the provision of digital money does not depend on the decision of any agency or organization. The project group has identified monetary policy rules and writes them into the source code. From the source code.',\n",
       " ' a workstation app can be operated by anyone who is interested in the project. all those who are interested in rules are not changed. The rules that can determine the maximum amount of money will be issued in circulation. release conditions and other details. Development groups may decide whether the number of coins is limited (as in the case of Cardano and Bitcoin) or whether infinite inflation will be given (Ethereum). Burning tokens can be applied so the number of coins may decrease over time. Can even combine some rules. such as for infinite inflation but must burn. it is difficult to predict the supply in the following years. Digital scarcity is not a feature but only the original protocol tokens (ADA. ) can have. but it is also applied to irreplaceable tokens and tokens (NFT). The tokens molded on Blockchain can also show digital scarcity. The scarcity of these tokens is executed by Blockchain protocols and rules determined in the smart contract (or casting set) used to cast tokens. Cardanos original assets have unique identification codes such as policy IDs. ensuring that each token can be distinguished and cannot be duplicated. The policy ID is permanently attached to the content and the policy command determining the characteristics as who can cast tokens and when those actions can be done. This creates a system in which the provision of tokens can be controlled and verified. contributing to making them scarce. NFT on Blockchain redefines digital scarcity with a unique and verified scarcity. When NFT is cast. it is usually done in limited quantities and this scarcity is clearly shown during the casting process. The history of NFT can be verified and cannot be duplicated. which adds to its value. How is NFT different from the common image on the Internet?. An image stored on a computer or shared via the internet can be copied many times without reducing honesty. resulting in unlimited supply. it is impossible to say which image is original (the first image created by the author) and which image is a copy. Without a third party. copyright monitoring. it is not easy to determine the owner of an image (copyright owner) on the Internet. as the owner may be anyone who has saved that image on their computer. This is basically different from digital assets based on Blockchain. which cannot be copied due to the encryption principles and consensus mechanisms of the network as the foundation for blockchain technology. Each digital property on Blockchain is unique and cannot be copied. creating a digital scarcity similar to the scarcity of material goods. It is important to distinguish between local and tokens in terms of control of rules. In the case of local rules. the rules are controlled by the group and community members running the workstation application on their computer. The change of rules is very complicated and requires the consensus mechanism of the majority. In the case of tokens (including NFT). the rules are determined (and often controlled) by the token cast entity.',\n",
       " ' Blockchain can protect tokens from creating copies and fake goods. but casting and burning them may still be under the control of a person or one group. The existence of scarcity token is scarce depends on many factors. The ability to create and maintain digital scarcity is impossible without the internet. computer and electricity. The existence of tokens and tokens is directly dependent on digital depends on other technologies and resources. It is impossible to create scarce tokens by digital but their existence can be guaranteed forever. The existence of tokens and tokens is based on coding. Keeping digital money in your wallet (also known as self -management rights) and to spend them requires the ability to keep the code secret (password cluster). Even if you keep the money on a centralized exchange. others still have to create a wallet. create a password cluster and keep money for you. Although we are talking about the scarcity of digital money. we are talking about a record in a decentralized database (blockchain. ledger) and the ability to create a new record. Token are numbers related to the blockchain address. Blockchains ability to prevent someone naturally generate new money (changing the monetary policy of the project) is based on the ability to prevent an invalid import item in the ledger (invalid transactions). As you will see below. another protective measure is not forced to change the source code without the approval of the majority. A essential feature of digital scarcity is drawn from the above. Digital scarcity depends on the ability to verify the amount of money being circulated. This verification is done by the transparency and transparency ledger of Blockchain. recording all transactions and creating new tokens. Anyone can check the blockchain to confirm the total supply and circulation token at any time. This transparency and verification is the cause of digital assets become scarce and distinguish them from digital files that are easy to copy as images. The digital scarcity of ADA (and all other tokens) depends on the capabilities of the cardano protocol in creating new blocks periodically. ie on the consensus mechanism of the network. This requires people (mainly the block manufacturer) installs the workstation app on their computer and pays the Internet. Electricity. ADAs digital scarcity depends on the long -term economic sustainability of the protocol (privacy budget) and the ability to resist attacks from outside (hackers. government. ) and internal (groups. block manufacturers. The security budget is too wide to be mentioned in this article. this is extremely important because people expect that scarce digital tokens will exist for several decades and rules will not change. The existence of tokens is conditioned by many external factors and the immutability of rules is a hypothetical based on decentralization and social contracts between agents (those who may have different interests and concerns). What is the difference between the digital scarcity of ADA and BTC? In both cases. these are numbers. The basic difference is not money but everything related to Cardano and Bitcoin protocols.',\n",
       " ' Different projects on decentralization. ability to expand. security and many other features. As the owner of the token. you find the difference in handling transactions. fees and the ability to exchange tokens or use DEFI. Users interact with the protocol if they want to use money. The quality of tokens (visible difference) can be felt mainly through the protocol utilities rather than through the attributes of the number in the ledger. The difference may be subjective and objective. Objectively. Cardano can transfer digital assets (coin) faster and cheaper than Bitcoin. subjective. users can consider Bitcoin as a safer protocol thanks to the POW consensus mechanism. Discuss the properties of the protocol (the consensus mechanism of the network) outside the scope of this article. it is important to know that the properties of the protocol affect the awareness of tokens. Network protocol is a software that is always maintained by groups. So what is the relationship between groups and holders of digital property? It is a type of social contract. Social contracts refer to the unwritten agreement or gather the expectations between the community holding tokens and the development team behind a Crypto project. It includes mutual understanding and believes that the group will act for the best benefit of the community. In return. the community is expected to support the project through investment. promotion and participation. This social contract is usually not an official contract but a collective belief in the principles. goals and crypto management. the Cardano project searches for an official form of management. The goal is to clearly identify the management structure. rights and obligations of the group. the ability to decide changes in management. AI should be a group member. Social contract includes expectations such as transparency. ability to respond. It is important to note that the source code (software) constantly changes. People may change the code. but mainly ensure that customers (containing changes) become dominated in the network. have great power to the project (so also for digital scarcity). In addition to the development group. important stakeholders (Stake people. operators) and block producers (Pool operators. authentic people. ) are also important agents. anyone in the world can Fun source and create an alternative workstation application (there may be different rules). Convincing people to install this version on their computer is much harder. A group cannot arbitrarily change rules without receiving the approval of the majority of communities. The nodes of block manufacturers and large parties are especially important because they decide the longest chain. Cardano and Bitcoin use Nakamoto consensus mechanisms so the longest chain is the appropriate string. Creating the longest chain requires the most multi -resource (Copper ADA. the hash ratio). social contracts are a reflection of the culture of the community and the project guidance values. It plays an important role in the ability to survive and develop for a long time. as it directly affects the level of participation and support of the community. The scarcity of digital money also largely depends on the decentralization and management of the project.',\n",
       " ' digital scarcity is a characteristic of many factors. Blockchain network is very powerful and can resist changes. it is technology with all the good and bad aspects that come with it. Digital scarcity is affected by needs in the same way as traditional scarcity. When a digital asset has high demand but the supply is limited. its value tends to increase. This is based on the economic principle of scarcity. which clearly states that the rarer or harder the product. the more valuable the product is. If a specific type of crypto is hunted a lot but has a limit to its total supply. the price of that type of crypto may increase when many people compete to get it. This is because the perception value of digital assets increases due to scarcity and high demand for it. the limited number of coins is not necessarily the reason for the increasing demand. the scarcity of digital money is easy to recur. There are thousands of crypto types with different characteristics. People may have different interests and interests when choosing to buy crypto. Although the maximum supply of money is fixed and monetary policy (gradually reducing the amount of money issued in circulation) is unchanged. the demand is very volatile. Demand can fluctuate due to the trend. financial market conditions. enhancing applications. important partnerships. used in the real world. speculation. expectations. high competition between projects. competition between communities. Is the digital scarcity useful?. This is a very complex question and it can depend on what can be done with tokens or tokens and how many people will use certain utilities. This topic refers to the central bank. copyright protection. complete calculation. comprehensive and access to financial services. The potential is huge but the ability to use is still low. If more and more people believe that digital money can keep the value. their value will increase because the demand will increase. the opposite is also true. When the application (demand) decreases. the market price of tokens will decrease. Token in the form of money or means of storage value will only be helpful if their value is stable or slightly increased over time. And stability is prescribed by regular needs. It is important to mention that although the potential of digital scarcity is huge. the more widely used depends on the level of technology maturity of blockchain projects. digital scarcity depends on other utilities such as fast verification. fast transfer. easy to install wallet and protect from loss of coins and tokens. The utility of tokens and tokens increases significantly thanks to the programming capabilities (smart contracts). This industry is still in the early stage. The increasing utility of the increasing protocols and network effects will most likely be reflected in the demand for tokens. Utilities will develop with technological innovation. the scarcity of digital money is not the guarantee of value stability. This can change in the future with higher application levels. The digital scarcity of tokens and coins. along with the ability to easily verify ownership.',\n",
       " ' send value and prevent the creation of copies and fake goods. is a technology with potential to significantly improve the ability of the Internet. The Internet has disturbed social. Blockchain is a breakthrough technology with similar potential. The success of this technology depends on the application. more precisely the ability to learn how to use the wallet to manage and take advantage of all financial and social applications may promote them to use Blockchain. At the present time. it can be said that digital scarcity is a major innovation that we have not been able to take full advantage of society (although the use is gradually increasing). Cardano uses a variant of Nakamoto consensus called Ouroboros. It is the consensus mechanism (POS) using the basic principles invented by Satoshi Nakamoto to Bitcoin. Ouroboros is designed to provide security guarantee similar to Proof-of-Work (POW) and more energy-saving. we will explain the basic principles of the Nakamoto consensus mechanism and highlight the difference between POW and POS. The focus will be the basic principles and mechanisms. Nakamoto consensus was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. anonymous who created Bitcoin. This is a solution to the Mathematics of the Maths of Byzantine. the question can reach a consensus in a decentralized network of many independent nodes. Ouroboros is designed to provide security assurance similar to Bitcoin while saving more energy. Cardanos POW POW shares the general principles of the Nakamoto consensus mechanism. despite the difference in their mechanism and implementation. The main difference between POW and POS lies in the way they follow these principles. POW requires the exploitation of complicated password puzzles by calculating power to add new blocks to Blockchain. POS selects the block manufacturer (Pool) to cast new blocks based on the number of ADAs they own or have been authorized for them. The basic difference is in the expensive resource that the consent mechanism POW and POS use. POW needs a large amount of hash speed (calculated power) to operate. This consumes a lot of energy. Electricity is an expensive resource and can be regenerated. The number is unlimited. POS is more energy -saving because digital money is used as resources. A small amount of electricity is consumed to operate the nodes. Token ADA is an expensive. unable to regenerate and scarce resource. The use of different expensive resources has affected the implementation of the principles of the Nakamoto consensus mechanism. Both the consensus mechanisms of POW and POS use different mechanisms to achieve block production time. random. comprehensive. average philosophy. POW and POS are different in individual elements. but both have a very similar consensus mechanism in terms of the principles of Nakamoto consensus. We will not mention all the elements in the article. We mainly focus on explaining how to achieve the consensus mechanism. Before going into the problem. explain the theory necessary. The purpose of the consensus mechanism in decentralized network is to ensure that all nodes participate. can spread on different positions. agree on a single state of the network despite lack of central agencies.',\n",
       " ' This agreement allows the network to maintain the consistent and reliable state of the ledger. The network must reach regular agreements. allowing the status of the ledger. In the blockchain network. the state will change whenever adds a new block. User transactions are inserted into blocks. In the case of cardano. the certificate can also be inserted into blocks. What do we mean when it comes to consensus mechanism?. The consensus mechanism may mention a set of rules that allow the decentralized nodes to reach a general agreement (through mutual information exchange and make autonomy decisions). These rules are encrypted in the source code of the network protocol. A basic protocol is a design and workstation is the software that implements this design. By installing workstations on their computer. users will become nodes contributing to the operation of decentralized (decentralized) network. The consensus mechanism may also specify the implementation of this agreement process. such as through POW or POS mechanisms. And the consensus mechanism may be the ability of the network to reach an agreement but it is also a specific way of deployment. The same term can refer to a possibility and a tool at the same time. you can see that the workstations use the Ouroboros POS consensus mechanism that allows them to reach a general agreement on the change of the status of the ledger. Note that the ledger is part of each workstation. Change the state is happening on all nodes. Before starting to explain the Nakamoto consensus mechanism. it is necessary to explain some important aspects applied to all types of network consensus for decentralized networks. The consensus mechanism must ensure that the network works exactly even if the nodes are defective or toxic. Toxic people who want to break the ability to achieve a consensus mechanism and thus damage the network can participate in the network at any time. Some nodes in the network can offline at the same time for many reasons. anyone who owns an expensive resource (the ratio of hash with Bitcoin or token in Cardano) can win a part of power (i. participating in the agreement). The reliability and security of the network is based on the assumption that the participants honestly hold a part of expensive resources greater than the toxic agents needed to break the consensus mechanism. Another assumption is that if many nodes suddenly offline. they can still achieve a consensus mechanism. Not all consensus can provide this. The network must handle errors and errors. both in the network and nodes involved without affecting the overall function of the system. The network must be able to bear the loads that arise. All the last nodes must eventually agree to the same state of the ledger. ensuring consistency and integrity across the entire system. The network must not fall into a situation where the state is divided into two different status pools (blockchain can be separated into two competitive chains) without solving this situation. You can see in the figure that the network maintains the uniform state of the ledger until the N+3 block.',\n",
       " ' the state is not clear. There is a pair of blocks with the same height N+4 and N+5. At a certain time. it is impossible to determine which ledger status is valid. The protocol rules must be prepared for all situations and ensure the consistency of the state. In the case of branching (FORK) state. the network must be able to detect incidents and decide clearly which status is correct (longer chain rule). you can see that the network has removed the blocks lower than N+4 and N+5 (orphans). New blocks N+6 and N+7 have been added behind the N+5 above. This chain has won and shows the current state (agreed) of the ledger. All the final processes must be made to make a decision. ensuring the final consensus protocol will end. the network is not allowed to fall into a situation where there is no way to achieve consensus. Continuing must be guaranteed. If the network stops after adding a pair of N+5 blocks and cannot add other blocks in the way that determines which status is true. a centralized pool (for example. a growing pool or the head) will have to intervene. This is unwanted (non -decentralized). Safety and continuity are two important attributes to ensure accurate and safe networking. The consensus mechanism of the networks of the network must balance these characteristics. They have to decide which one they prefer. Please describe these characteristics. Safe refers to the guarantee that the network will not encounter the wrong consensus. it ensures that any transaction is considered to be completed by a right -working node that will eventually be considered to be completed by all the properly operating nodes. It also means that no two transactions will be considered to be authentic because the two nodes are active in two different ways. In the case of extremes. this can be understood as the network that likes to stop the consensus mechanism rather than resolving incorrect transactions. In a more secure priority network. it is important to avoid Fork because Fork implies that there is a disagreement about the status of the ledger. which can lead to safety violations. Removing transactions is unwanted for such a network because it can weaken the reliability and reliability of the system. Users expect their transactions to be final and cannot be changed after they are put into a block and added to Blockchain. You can see this unwanted situation in the picture. The network has created two N+4 blocks and has different transactions in each block (small and blue box). The network must remove one of the N+4 blocks including transactions. These are requirements that are different from networks that prefer continuous than safety. The continuity is the guarantee that the network will continue to grow and not delay. This means that as long as there are not yet completed transactions. the collection of completed transactions will continue to increase. It ensures that all completed transactions will be solved by all honest nodes.',\n",
       " ' A more priority network rather than security will not stop when fork. it allows two temporary chains to exist and rely on network participants to continue building on-chain that they believe is right. the inconsistent state of the ledger will be temporarily accepted. you see a similar situation as above. Network rules allow this situation. The N+4 block below is removed (including red transactions). Block N+5 is added to insert red transactions. Both completed transactions are in the blockchain. I hope you know which property prefers the Nakamoto consensus mechanism. Cardano and Bitcoin both prioritize continuity rather than safety. This design option is clearly shown in the way of dealing with blockchain branches. In Nakamotos consensus mechanism. the nodes are guided to follow the longest series when FORK occurs. This rule ensures that the network continues to make progress and expand blockchain. even if there are temporary disagreements or fork. this approach can lead to temporary safety violations. such as when two miners exploit a block of the same magnitude at the same time. leading to branching. there may be two slot leaders can be voted at the same time. the network will converge to one of these blocks (string) as part of the longest chain rule. but until then. there may be contradictory states in trading history. The ultimate safety attribute will be restored when the consensus mechanism continues to be added to new blocks. A string becomes significantly longer than other chains. making it widely accepted. Although Nakamotos consensus mechanism aims to provide both safety and continuity. it is designed to ensure that the network still exists and can handle transactions even when encountering temporary disagreements or network problems. Safety is achieved when the Blockchain expands and the ability to organize again does not matter. Safety and continuity properties are associated with the completion of the probability of the Nakamoto consensus mechanism. Completion according to the probability refers to the concept that the completion of a transaction is not absolute at the time it is inserted into a new block. The completion of a transaction is becoming more and more clear when there are more blocks added above the transaction. Safety and continuity related to the complete probability in the following way:. Safety means that when a transaction has been put into a block and some blocks have been added above it (deepening its slot in the chain). that transaction ability is reversed (reconstitious) becomes very low. it is not not happening. There is always a small probability that a longer competition sequence may appear. although the probability decreases exponentially with each additional block. The vulgarity ensures that the completed transactions will be authenticated and added to the blockchain. As long as the pool (block manufacturer) continues to expand the blockchain by adding new blocks. the network will show continuity. Unsecured transactions will be included in the next block. but they will eventually be put in as long as they are valid and the network continues to operate.',\n",
       " ' Compared to the consensus mechanism of other networks more of safety than continuity. Nakamotos consensus mechanism may be slower. Users must wait for the network to add some more blocks on the block where his trading is inserted. Trading is not reversible after adding more blocks. All new blocks are added (above the users transaction block) shows the consensus mechanism with the status of the ledger. We will find out the following details. The image shows that the transaction of Alice (small blue box) has been inserted into the N+3 block. The completion of the transaction is 0 because no block has been added. With each additional addition. the completion of the transaction (and the N+3 block) will increase. When the N+4 block is added. the last number is 1. If Alice needs 3 blocks. there is enough authentication (3 other manufacturers of blocks agree to block N+3). she can consider the transaction that has been completed (irreversible) in the N+6 block. Note: The completion of the transaction can be viewed in the form of binary value. So whether the transaction is completed (permanently recorded in the blockchain) or not (not yet). That is why we often refer to the concept of the number of authentication. Each block is added after the block with your transaction showing one more authentication. In the N+6 block. the transaction has 3 authentication. If Alice considers this to be a sufficient amount of a transaction with a smaller amount. she can consider the transaction that has been completed. The reorganization of Blockchain can still occur. but with lower probability. Priority networks are more secure than the continuity that can collect the consent mechanism of the state faster. not through adding blocks. but through some forms of voting before or immediately after adding blocks. This type of consensus often requires a large number of nodes to actively participate in the vote on each block. The completion of transactions can only be achieved quickly if it is possible to receive a new status (block) approval from the majority of nodes in a short time. We have said that the consensus mechanism is a consensus between nodes about changing the status of the ledger. Nakamotos consensus mechanism can be described simply as follows. choose a random node in the network with the right to create a new block. This block will be released on the network. If another random node agrees with this block. it will connect its new block on this (latest) block. If it disagrees. it will add a new block to the previous block (i. the new block is added but not after the nearest block before). Please describe the following picture. Alice added N+2 block. This block will be received by other nodes in the network. So Bob and Carol will also receive it. Bob is randomly elected as the next block manufacturer. He connects the N+3 block (green) after the N+2 block. Carol received the N+3 block produced by Bob. She was randomly elected to be the next block manufacturer.',\n",
       " ' Carol has two options. She can connect block N+4 after the existing N+3 block. This is the expected scenario (because there will be no consistency in the ledger). But she doesnt like Bobs N+3 block. she decided to connect the N+3 block (red) after the N+2 block. This will create a FORK in the blockchain (the status of the ledger is not consistent). Another randomly selected mass manufacturer may decide to have a new block after a red or green block N+3. Two functions are the key to adding blocks. Determine when a new block will be added to anyone will produce it. And it is necessary to have random functions node and the protocol time. Agreement between nodes only occurs after the new status is proposed. Other nodes agree with the change with the length of the length by attaching a new block after the previous block. The agreement cannot be achieved from all nodes at the same time. but from only one node - the node will be selected as the next block manufacturer. Agreement is a gradual process. Node disagrees with each other about changing the state before it is expected to occur. a randomly selected node will propose a competent change and think that other nodes will agree. Other nodes will probably agree if the block is valid. The block manufacturer is encouraged to propose a valid block because this is the only way to receive the reward. there is a proposal and many people approved. Node in the network accepts a valid block because they have no reason to eliminate it. if the node removes valid blocks. all blocks created by Alice. the branches will arise in the network (and therefore there will be inconsistent in the ledger). This is unwanted. The process of adding a new block includes the following steps:. This process is the same for both Cardano and Bitcoin. Although each project uses different consensus mechanisms. they are basically no different. Describe the difference. The difference lies in the time of the protocol and the random choice of block manufacturers. Bitcoin is designed to create a new block every 10 minutes. The network adjusts the difficulty exploitation every two weeks (Block 2016) to maintain this block time. This adjustment ensures that the time needed to create a block is still stable. even when the hash speed of the network (the total calculated capacity is used for exploitation) changes. The random vote is based on the settlement of a mathematical task that requires high calculation (cryptography riddles). Node want to exploit a new pool (pool) will start solving tasks as soon as they receive a new block. All nodes start almost at the same time (network latency). The first node will immediately create a new block and play it online. Note that all pools solve the same mission. but only one pool can succeed. As soon as the Pool gets a new valid block. it will stop working with the current mission and start solving a new task (exploiting a new block).',\n",
       " ' Sometimes it occurs a task to solve two pools at the same time. a branch of Blockchain will occur and this will be resolved according to the mechanism described above. In Bitcoin. the process of adding a new block includes the following steps:. Cardano divides the time into a second (slot) and uses modern passwords. namely random functions that can be verified (VRF). for random selection. Instead of all nodes that solve a mathematical use of multiple computers. the so -called slot leader is determined by math and random input. Each node verification in each slot to see if it becomes slot leader or not. it will create a new block. There is no central agency to control the vote. The nodes register voting through certificates stored in the blockchain. The nodes can verify that they have become a completely autonomous slot leader. Each node needs its threshold. It originates from the size of the share. Shares include the operators ADA (pledge) and all the stake. The larger the stake amount. the more the pool can produce the more blocks in a certain epoch. This is the same principle that we observe in Bitcoin. The more the hash speed is authorized for a pool. the more the pool will exploit the more blocks. Every second. each pool uses the VRF algorithm to get the VRF output. VRF output is compared to the threshold. If the VRF output is smaller than the threshold. the pool will become a slot leader and have the right to cast a new block. the process of adding new blocks includes the following steps:. this process is similar to the case of Bitcoin. Similar to Bitcoin. a few slot leaders may also be voted for 20 seconds (Cardano blocking time). Maybe 2 slots will be elected to the same slot. the longer chain rule is used to solve the Fork of Blockchain. The output of the VRF vote is a series that decides the series to come in the case of Fork Blockchain. One of the other differences is the incentive model. The Bitcoin reward is paid to the pool (miner) in each new block. Cardano rewards all Spos and Stake people every 5 days (Epoch). We will find many similar small differences. when authenticating a block. evidence that mathematical tasks have been resolved will be verified. evidence suggests that the block from Node is chosen as a slot leader that has been verified (other things verified. such as KES signature). ensuring that the status of the ledger is not arbitrarily changed by a fraud node. a fraud node will have to consume a huge calculation power to create a new fraud. a fraud node will have to break the password. which also requires huge calculation power. Both methods have similar security. Through the password. Cardano can randomly vote for slots more effectively for a certain period of time and make sure that no one other than the elected slot leader can add a new block to the blockchain.',\n",
       " ' Bitcoin needs to consume a huge energy for the same purpose. Nakamotos consensus mechanism has a slow but very strong transaction time. If a large number of offline nodes. the network can still create blocks (although at a slower speed). Cardano and Bitcoin differ in many aspects such as decentralization. security budget. balance method. Nakamotos consensus mechanism cannot directly affect the quality of a decentralized process. In the current Bitcoin network. more than 50% of the blocks are created by only two pools. while on Cardano network. there are more than 1. This is due to different reward mechanisms (the concept of pool saturation is very important). Bitcoin is not interested in having a single block manufacturer or 1000. Cardano protocol knows its decentralization and can encourage its economic development. A decentralization is a major feature of the Blockchain network. The main objective of the network consensus is to allow an agreement between a large number of block manufacturers (they can be in order from hundreds to thousands). The quality of the individual attributes of the network is determined by a combination of many different factors and details. Nakamotos consensus mechanism is one of the main factors for both Bitcoin and Cardano. but there are other factors. Reward mechanism. comprehensive and balanced method affect decentralization. This is the point that POW and POS are basically different. Unlike mining. Stake has a smaller accession barrier. less risk and everyone in the world can access. This is one of many differences.December 5. It is difficult for users to use their own management wallet because it requires the least knowledge of the basic principles of the password. they must know the processes that take place in Blockchain and Crypto wallets. we will explain the basic principles of password lock and transaction. To make it easier to understand. we deliberately simplify the explanation of some processes and ignore some details. The article is mainly for new people. allows you to own property monopoly. This means that only you and no one else in the world has the right to control property. The exclusive ownership means that only you can create valid transactions to transfer assets from your blockchain address to the recipients address. And only you can spend assets. This feature depends on the ability to create and maintain your secret code. Ownership and transfer of assets in the Blockchain network based on public key codes (also known as asymmetric codes). the code provides tools that allow mutual communication between remote participants in a secret and reliable manner. But only with the secret code is not revealed. Anyone who wants to own property must first create a secret code. This secret is called seed or password. Some certain words are randomly selected from the list of predefined words (for example: bip-39). it may be 24 words. but you may also encounter less words in the password. It may be 15 words. Each cardano wallet will create a password for you after you install it.',\n",
       " ' Self -management wallet can never work without a secret code. If you install it only works with your secret. Can use existing passwords and the so -called wallet restoration. You can even use multiple wallets with the same secret secret. make sure that only you can see a randomly created password. It is a secret secret that will allow you to own exclusive property. make sure you are using the verified wallet and you downloaded (or installed it) from a reliable source. You must remember exactly the password cluster displayed in the wallet. You must be able to collect the same list of words in the same order if necessary. This cannot be done without writing it on paper or using some other methods for safety storage (for example: engraving words into metal). Never store a password in the form of digital. ie in the file or by taking photos on mobile phones. You may need a password again if you lose a lightweight wallet on your computer. all your computer or smartphone or hardware wallet. Remember that if you know the password. you still own your property. You may even intentionally delete your wallet but you need to know the password to restore it. The ownership of assets does not depend on the existence of the wallet and the ability to create valid transactions. maintain the secret code. the password cluster. Now you have a secret code in physical form and a wallet that has been installed. The next step is to take digital secret from the password cluster. It is the creation of password locks. Many separate and general courses are decentralized according to the password cluster. This process is called a hierarchical determination (HD). Good news is that you dont have to worry about that. Your wallet will do everything for you. You just need to know what is happening in the background mode and the processes are happening there. The user interface of the wallet helps you avoid the complexity related to the code. you can see the main derivative structure begins with seeds. pairs of seed locks (passwords). The main key is the highest level of a decentralized determination of a wallet. It is often said. stating not holding your key. not your money. What is the lock? It can be said that the lock is part of the secret code. especially the separate course. You can imagine the lock as a string of many disturbing characters. almost fits on a line. That is the combination of multiple numbers 0 and 1 digital. Two related locks are used. Private key (or signed) is created first. It is marked red in the picture. As the name implies. this course must be kept secret. The transaction is signed by this key. The key signature is a certain encryption activity that can be verified by the second general key. The general key (or also the verification key) is taken on this separate keyword. It is marked with green in the picture.',\n",
       " ' this lock can be public. a pair of main locks was created. The main key can be used to get multiple cardano accounts. each account has a set of address and key. The account is also a pair of locks representing your shares in Cardano and allows you to authorize that money for a group. Stake is not the topic of this article. remember that Stake also works through password. We will focus on sending transactions from one address to another. requesting the payment lock. Blockchain address is used to keep money (UTXO). Utxo can be received on them and then send UTXO from them. Public key (from a pair of payment locks) is used to create addresses. while private locks are used to sign transactions and thus prove the ownership of the amount. The following text will be simplified for easier to understand. We will not handle the blockchain addresses. The owner of the property is the one who proves it and the Cardano network is the verification. In the process of sending assets through transactions. a pair of related locks should be used. The content is associated with an address taken for the general keyword. The sender signed an electronic signing. providing evidence of property ownership at a certain address. Private locks are used to sign transactions. You can imagine the digital signature of a trading as the usual signature of a pen. An expert will be able to verify the signature clearly and indicate whether you will sign the document. Cardano (Blockchain network) must verify the signature through the general course. It will be verified that the individual key corresponds to the address where the property is used. Cardano must have a part of public code secret and a privacy part in the form of digital signatures available for authentication. By signing a transaction. separate locks will not be disclosed. This means that the address may still contain UTXO due to exclusive ownership transactions. In the process of authentication. it is also verified that the address contains sufficient amounts of assets for the owner to spend. Transactions contain the address of the recipient. This address is taken for the general keyword of the recipient. The recipient holds the individual lock so it can be sent (spending) of the property from this address. you can see the simplification process described above. Alice sent UTXO to BOB. Utxo is located on the Blockchain address belonging to Alice. Alices wallet creates a transaction and gives that head utxo. The additional transaction parameters are specified. the value of spending from UTXO (for simplicity. the entire UTXO is sent to Bob. So Alice does not receive anything). A output UTXO will be made from input UTXO in which the BOB Blockchain address will be specified (the common bob course has been used). In order for the property to be transferred. Alice must sign a transaction with its own key through his wallet. Digital signatures will be verified by Cardano network. not drawn in the picture.',\n",
       " ' Choose UTXO to insert into transactions. It also selected separate courses required for the signature. Most. users only need to enter the spending password or confirm the sending of the transaction by pressing the node in the hardware wallet. It is important to carefully check the address of the recipient and the amount to be sent. The transactions are not refunded. When a transaction is put into a block. it cannot be completed. If UTXO is sent to the wrong address (not existing or of others). this record will be permanently stored in the Blockchain. Mistakes cannot be corrected. What is self -management of property? What do the property owners need to note?. Blockchain network is basically a decentralized ledger to keep the proposal of property ownership. Blockchain address is used instead of the owners name. A record in the ledger can only be changed through password. In order to change the property owner. the current owner of that property must prove his ownership by signing a transaction through a private course. Self -management can be considered as the exclusive use of property. If the owner loses both a separate key (wallet) and a password (the physical form of the secret code secret). the record in the ledger will be recorded forever. Property will exist but cannot be used. when losing the secret code. the owner also lost all the property permanently. If someone tries to steal or disclose your secret secret. they will have the same control of your property like you. You are responsible for the exclusive ownership of your property. If you fail and someone transfers the property to another blockchain address. there is no way to change it. It is not possible to prove whether a certain transaction is signed by you or the person who stole your secret code (a password or a separate lock). Property is controlled by anyone holding a separate key (or password) of certain blockchain addresses. That is thought to be the only one. Many people may know the secret code. The consensus mechanism of the network does not know about the context of transactions and property owners. It only confirms the transactions. verify the digital signature. If the transactions are valid. the items in the ledger will be changed. The property will be transferred from the senders address to the recipients address. The transactions will be stored in the blockchain (ledger) forever. There is no other way to change the property owner in addition to using a private key. This gives owners full control of property. they are completely responsible for the secret code and must be aware of all the risks. Next time we will explain the details we have simplified in this article. We will talk about which type of code used. the way and the reason for the blockchain address is chopped. the digital signature is active. the way the locks are specified origin. The objective of this article is to clarify the basic concepts related to the use of self -depository.',\n",
       " ' It will be very beneficial for users to know the basic knowledge of cryptography and know which processes that take place during the transfer of property. In the first part. we explained the greatest benefits of decentralization. we will discuss the reason why the application of blockchain technology is lower than expected and whether the benefits described are beneficial to normal people. In the same order. we will take a look at all the benefits we have listed in the previous article. The success of any blockchain depends on whether people learn how to use their own management wallets. Blockchain technology only makes sense if people do not rely on centralized depository wallet. We will explain the reason below. If people are not interested in self -management. it can be understood that they are not interested in blockchain and therefore DEFI services. people are afraid of self -management of property. It is too much responsibility for them. It is easy to make mistakes and lose property forever. There is no way to fix and restore property. Using Blockchain wallet is very complicated. Copying blockchain addresses is risk. When people want to send larger money. they often send a smaller amount in advance. a larger amount. Not only new people but even experienced users need to do this way. The BTC value is kept over 44 million blockchain addresses. People hold the organizers in their wallets often use many addresses. the address of the exchanges and other services is also included so there are very few people holding the right to self -governing. It is estimated that it will reach millions. corresponding to the number of HW wallets sold (many users deposit themselves with many HW wallets). The popular Metamask wallet. used for DEFI services not only on the Ethereum platform. has been downloaded by more than 22 million users (data reported in August 2023). DEFI users may have an equivalent amount or just a little larger than the holder holder. Crypto is estimated to be held by about 550 million people on the planet. Only about 2-5% of these people hold property in the form of self-management. If there is no self -management right. it is impossible to interact on peer -to -peer network (P2P) among users. People who hold property on centralized exchanges do not use blockchain. as well as Lightning Network or DEFI services. If the number of users does not increase. the network effect will not increase. The attractive thing for newcomers is the ability to interact with others. Successful social networks thanks to network effects. It was a little problem about the chicken and the egg. Blockchain and all other services are built on it need users to have more users. How to attract users on Blockchain?. Blockchains biggest utility is self -management. but it is difficult to apply due to risks and shortcomings mentioned. What many people consider to be the biggest benefit of Blockchain is not attractive to the majority of people. the property owners do not want to lose it because of a stupid mistake.',\n",
       " ' The argument of BTC will never be confiscated by a third party will not convince everyone to use Bitcoin if they are afraid that they can lose money due to their fault. If people do not even hold BTC. do not expect the efforts to encrypt assets in the real world will succeed. Those who try to do this face the same problem. people are afraid of using new technology. The exception is that the dollar is taken. the currency that people in developing countries are forced to use. they can use centralized exchanges. The trading floors. as well as traditional companies like Paypal. see the potential and are trying to integrate the tokens on Blockchain into their centralized solutions. The depository wallet will be a suitable solution for a part of the people. The question is what does this mean for the application of DEFI services as well as the sustainability and long -term economic security of the blockchain. Need to improve the user interface if we want everyone to use their own management wallet. We need to replace the blockchain address with something simply like the name or phone number. We need to find a way to prevent people from making stupid mistakes or how to restore the property sent to the wrong/non -existent address. I know these seem like issues that cannot be overcome at this time. Crypto is expected to return power to people. The biggest argument for Bitcoins existence is that we will create non -state money. In Cardanos case. it is said that we will build replacement financial services. Now we know that people dont care about that. Or at least not now. Taking power into our hands means stopping using money or financial services we are used to using. Network effects as well as reliability and user friendliness of existing services are high. Talking too much. it can be said that the right to self -management is the only thing that works perfectly on Blockchain (temporarily skip the user interface). Blockchain network is currently not good. Slow and expensive payment. Local bank transfer on working day happened immediately. reliable and free in many countries. Blockchain can compete in the case of cross -border transactions. most people dont need it. If people believe in the institutions of a certain country. they do not need to leave them or look for alternative options. You need to recognize that. Most people do not see the difference between autonomy and money kept in bank accounts. If you make money in a normal way as an employee. you do not participate in a shady business and you buy normal things in the store. you can almost be sure that you will have no problem when you spend your money. This is applied to the majority of the population in developed countries. The replacement of identifier with crypto is another powerful argument of the Crypto community. Most people are confusing. The volatility itself is a problem that makes most people satisfied when using Fiat currencies relatively stable.',\n",
       " ' There are many other questions related to the replacement of the central bank that experts do not have answers. what will happen if you cant print money when the crisis happens? Some Bitcoin operators give some answers to capitalist capitalism. This is unacceptable for most people on the planet. We see that Blockchain will be used mainly in places where there is no reliable financial infrastructure or even in places where states do not perform their work well. That is in developing countries. I wrote that Blockchain gives everyone privacy. ensuring fairness. transparency and ensuring the immutability of rules. And similar things people expect from the current system. If they feel the system works as they expect. they have no reason to find alternatives. People associate the use of an alternative system built on new technology with risks. People will not take risks unless they feel threatened or deceived. The application of Blockchain does not necessarily occur by suddenly replacing this system by another. It will most likely be a process that slowly lasts several decades. People will gradually integrate blockchain into existing infrastructure in reasonable places. In terms of application. the Crypto community may go ahead of the main trend in some cases. I believe that handing over power into the hands of the people is possible. but I dont expect it to be as easy as replacing the fiat currency with Bitcoin. Most people do not want such a change. they are afraid of it. we are not technically ready for it and a serious debate about economic impacts has not yet started. If the concept of decentralization is successful. so is the smart contract platform. if everyone is familiar with the self -management wallet. the next step is to use Layer 2 and DEFI networks. It takes the first step to be able to take the second step. From the above. it is clear that we have not done the first step. Do not expect DEFI to be more successful than Hodl. Money is about financial services. Financial services are about mutual interaction between users. the blockchain industry is not about Hodl but in terms of financial interaction. I think Defi is a very righteous reason for self -management. If you hold the property on a centralized trading floor. you cannot use their value to get more profits (although it is possible to stay POS money). The large number of Metamask wallets are downloaded corresponding to the number of people holding BTC that the DEFI sector is working well. DEFI services need to be more integrated with traditional finance. There must be more capital in it. This may happen. Banks are discovering DEFI services and caring for tokens. Sooner or later. some large banks will encrypt not only identifying but also stocks and other financial assets. and DEX will be used for transactions. Sometimes people ask Blockchain that has solved the real problem. I think the answer to this question will come from the second grade and DEFI.',\n",
       " ' Self -management is a feature that it is not directly useful for the masses. Interaction is useful. What DEFI must bring is reliability and useful financial services instead of meaningless farming. This will only be achieved through user and capital growth. DEFI will only succeed if the blockchain loan has some advantages compared to conventional bank loans. The advantage is not (only) autonomy. fairness and things that the masses do not appreciate. Benefits must be economically. which is more favorable conditions. This can be done through higher efficiency of automatic services. This takes us to the sequel to the article. Blockchain does not care who its user is and does not choose them. It does not distinguish ethnicity. This is a huge advantage. the opening of branches for the poor in developing countries is disadvantage (meaning expensive and risky). DEFI service or second layer on Blockchain does not care. Blockchain can connect the world. Dollar tokenization or dex on Cardano can be used by the poor and the rich. Payment across the border may be cheap. fast and reliable. With the development of decentralized identity. Oracles and other services. there will be a unified global infrastructure operated mainly by richer people in the West but can be used by the poor in developing countries. Financial services. especially micro loans. can be provided to people in developing countries. who have never had such a chance before. Global popularity is a utility that people understand and can be promoted self -management wallet. it should be realized that in developing countries with lower education. the ability to access the internet is worse. people have fewer capital. often without identification cards. Even in places where Blockchain is most meaningful. the application will not occur overnight. Many problems need to be solved. Motivation is important. Westerners do not need to change anything if satisfied with the service they can use. People in developing countries are not well -off and for them. Blockchain is mainly hope for better changes. Blockchain will succeed if it streamlines existing processes. Successful Internet is also for the same reason. It streamlines information access. accelerates some processes and makes some services cheaper. cross -border transactions take place slowly. expensive and prone to errors. This is because the transaction is processed by some organizations. Cardano will send any money from China to Africa or America for a few seconds and a tenth of dollars. The start of using blockchain for this service is economic significance. Do not encrypt money but basically encrypt all financial assets. This reason can be continued. Is it possible to rationalize financial activities and replace old paperwork through the performance of smart contracts? Of course. It is possible to reduce the delay and eliminate friction in the system. The process of automatically increases reliability and less errors occur. Paying for calculations is often cheaper than human labor costs. If something is more effective. it may be cheaper for end users. This is the reason to use DEFI and also an opportunity to be applied.',\n",
       " ' To build on Blockchain and exploit its potential. technology improvement should be continued. The biggest obstacle for application is the ability to expand low and the technological immatureness of layer 2. Although the potential seems to be great. without the expansion of the first classes. this technology is almost impossible to use for the masses. the Crypto communitys expectations far beyond the readiness of technology. People want to see higher applicability and solutions for practical problems but do not realize that it is still too early for everyone and businesses to start using blockchain daily. The fluctuating fee and the blockage network prevent the actual use. Although decentralized is the most important thing we should talk about. but from the realistic point of view. it is the ability to expand. If Blockchain is poorly decentralized and without good scale. it is no longer interesting for businesses. If it is decentralized well but does not have good scale. it can be attractive to the community but cannot be used for the masses. The blockchains that their group preferred to expand rather than decentralized will be most ready to be applied. Solana and Avalanche. It is reasonable for businesses to build on these blockchains because they dont care about decentralization. They are mostly interested in utilities. They think that future users will not care about decentralization so they can also ignore it. They may be right. we will have a decentralized blockchain and at the same time can expand well. Those who are aware of the importance of self -management rights and third -party disadvantages will be satisfied with such a network. and it will allow widely applied in this decade. reality is different. It will take at least 5-10 years for such a network to exist. we can argue about what quality decentralization looks like. this is not the topic of the article. My personal belief is a decentralization of Alpha and Omega of this industry. The concentration always leads to problems that this industry wants to solve and improve. we see that even the Bitcoin community is not interested in improving decentralization (with the belief that Bitcoin is the most decentralized and safest blockchain and nothing better than possible). The main concern of most owners is the ETF approval. Will a decentralized topic get attention in the future and will there be a serious debate on this topic? We dont know. we wrote that blockchain technology can change the function of belief in the relationship between people and in the relationship between people and organizations. This will only happen if people believe in blockchain technology and learn how to use it. This is a big challenge. I cannot imagine what is more difficult than changing the way of working in society. Those who invest in crypto assets and keep them in the monitoring wallet do not use blockchain. They can believe that this technology has the potential because they stake their destiny into it. they do not understand this technology or do not trust enough to use self -management wallets.',\n",
       " ' success will never come without Blockchain users. If people only speculate. we will only see a part. Crypto will attract technology enthusiasts. people who comply with the law and some organizations will rationalize some processes. Belief in Blockchain technology is a complex issue. Application of a Crypto project means choosing a network or multiple networks. a specific service. an economic model or can become a member of a community (or multiple communities). Belief in Blockchain is impaired due to toxicity among communities. localism. theft. hack DEFI. lies. Thien Vi media. unclear and difficult regulations in navigating complex topics. One can talk about any topic for hours. With the use of the Internet. it is easy because. from the user; The point of view. only one network. The only problem is that the data download speed is slow but gradually improves. Gradually. new services were created to find users. The blockchain industry can be described as a battle of small groups. Personal communities (bigger or smaller) are trying to promote the blockchain they have chosen and think that their blockchain will be the chosen and become the backbone of the world. Like 10 dwarfs fighting and millions of others are watching or not interested at all. Even experts do not have the opportunity to orient themselves in the industry very diverse and towards this future as well as predict future developments. What a chance new?. In the early days. no one could estimate the impact of the Internet on society. the use of it in the future. the number of services or the number of industries will be interrupted. Does anyone think they can do that in the case of blockchain?. I can imagine dozens of different situations and I will not be able to choose a script for Stake. The technological advances that the Blockchain industry achieved every year was amazing. This is positive. because at present. both projects are not ready for the common trend and will not be long. Cardano has the opportunity to succeed because the IOG group is one of the largest and most experienced groups in the industry. The community cares about decentralization. There is a plan for expansion. The second class is being built. Defi is booming. this is not enough to succeed. Cardano is not the Internet. There is a huge competition in the industry. It is impossible to say the current characteristics or circumstances or future will determine the fate of any project. In all ecosystems. we can observe the development of interesting technologies and efforts to succeed. Continuing to build and meet the needs of the market or users is probably the best advice for the community. See more article part I here.December 4. This article will help new people understand the basic principles of decentralized blockchain. We will explain that decentralization is a process of scale and fluctuations. that the only two errors can become one and ensuring security is also an important aspect. We will focus on block production.',\n",
       " ' not administrators. the principles are often the same. A decentralization is not a binary value that can turn on and off. A decentralization is the scale. The lower limit is known. If there is only one dominant agent in the network with absolute control of the production of blocks. the network is concentrated. The above limit is more difficult to determine. everyone participating in the system must have the same right to make decisions. this ideal is not achieved. especially in the case of Blockchain. Economic and technical aspects that prevent it. A decentralization is often based on an expensive resource. The wealth in our society is not evenly distributed. Rich people can buy more expensive multi -resources in cash. So they may have more control of their lives. The power in the Blockchain network can be purchased with money. Everyone participating in the network cannot create blocks. The ability to achieve the consensus mechanism will decrease as the number of participants increases. due to the increased cost of computer resources and the complexity of communication. In the following text. we want to talk about participants actively participating in the production of blocks. And mainly the manufacturer of blocks. but also authorized expensive resources (hash ratio. token). A decentralization is a process of fluctuating and constantly changing over time. People respond to events and make decisions that have a direct or indirect impact on the quality of a decentralized process. And decentralization may increase or decrease. Many positions with different tasks can be determined to produce blocks or administrators. the operator of the pool. the operator. the full node operator and the holder of the BTC participated in the block production. It is similar to Cardano. Participants are Pool operators. Stake people. fully node operators and ADA owners (for some reason not Stake Ada). If we want to quantify decentralized. we need to describe the roles. determine their impact on the entire infrastructure and then assess the number of individual agents in the context of their corresponding scale. Comparing the two blockchain networks with each other may be a challenge for these reasons. in most blockchains. the role is very similar. Most of the nodes produce power blocks and authorities (miners. stakes). There are always big. medium and small players in the ecosystem. The old participants left and newcomers. some participants can gradually win the dominant position. Old people can win a solid position that new people can hardly participate. The exclusive exclusive exclusive is an undesirable condition but it occurs in the market and in politics. there is always a power competition. If one or more successful participants in this struggle. the centralization process begins. A decentralization is like democracy. It is necessary to regularly pay attention to decentralization. attracting attention to issues and solving them. Without this process. sooner or later someone can take over too much power. A decentralization must be stable. the most ideal is that it will grow (at least a little) along with the number of new users.',\n",
       " ' expand the scale when applied. It is meaningless when the network is controlled by the number of participants in consensus is smaller while the number of users is increasing. And it can be said that the stagnation itself has shown a risk (or at least a warning signal) if we expect a higher level of acceptance. A decentralized network must not have any errors. This means that no weaknesses can be exploited to attack or weaken the network. In these centralized networks. this weakness is the server that the workstations are connected. The server is the master and workstation is SLAVER. The workstations cannot communicate with each other without a server. If the server stops working. all workstations will stop working at the same time. A workstation cannot become a server. the server is a single error point. if your bank server stops working. no customers can make bank transfer. Someone needs to repair and restart the server so that everything will return to normal. servers are almost always backed up. If one machine fails. another machine will take over. A server serves workstations and if it is faulty. the second backup server will immediately undertake all tasks. this is not like a decentralization. A decentralization is not taking over the work in case of failure but the common responsibility of all nodes in the network for the same task. the nodes have similar location and importance in the context of participating in the main processes in the system. If suddenly an offline node. affecting the processes in the network will be at a minimum. If the two nodes offline at the same time. the impact will be a bit higher. but it is likely that users will not even notice. The goal of the network is to maximize the maximum diversification. whether in terms of the number of nodes (or their owners). geographic navigation. using Cloud services. If the two dominant groups are creating blocks and one group suddenly offline. there may be a short -term problem that users will notice. If there are 1.000 block manufacturers in the network and the level of high diversification. the stopping of one of them (even 100 of them) is negligible. If there are two dominant block manufacturers in the network. they are two only failures. It is important to note that two such points can easily become one. They may agree to cooperate. Someone can try to attack these two points at the same time. targeting a DDOS attack on two dominant manufacturers. Attacking less targets is always easier than large quantities. Development of decentralized development with higher number of participants and diversification. If participants do not know each other and many of them. the possibility of them may agree on something very low. the network is protected from external and inside attacks. An external attack was carried out by a person who wanted to destroy the network and did not have a positive relationship with it. The attacker can attack DDOS or attack 51%.',\n",
       " ' An internal attack can be performed by a person with a positive relationship with the network but wants to abuse his strength. two dominant Pool operators may agree on an attack. Participants are not necessarily voluntarily initiating the attack. They may accidentally or accidentally be taken advantage of to attack or directly forced to attack. This is an important insight in the context of the sequel. A decentralization should not be based on the assumption that the occasional cyber attackers will be economic disadvantage. but based on the certainty that they cannot attack the network due to high decentralization. Assuming that the more additional participating entities. the better because they do not need to know each other and the few can cooperate in an attack (or will be taken advantage of or forced to do so). This assumption means a technical feasibility attack (relatively). but there are major economic reasons to not implement it. We can make another assumption. No one wants to commit crimes by attacking the bodies of participants. or no one will write down the law that prescribes the behavior of the participants. The exploitation (authorized person) will authorize other places if the group operates dishonestly (for example. trading transactions). We can make so many theoretical assumptions. but the reality may be different from the unpleasant consequences for decentralization. Show it with an example. if the network is dominated by a single block manufacturer. this entity can censors the blocks of smaller manufacturers and thus destroy them economically. We can still assume that the dominant manufacturer will not carry out this attack because it will be economic benefits if they act honestly and maintain profitable business activities. This attack will basically destroy not only the dominant manufacturer but also the reputation of the entire network (if there is no mechanism to reduce the power of participants). We can continue this thought and increase the number of manufacturers. We can assume the same in case 2 manufacturers dominate. 3 manufacturers. If only one of the two dominant manufacturers participated in the attack. the network would still be reliable and somewhat decentralized (ignoring the influence of other minority manufacturers). From certain manufacturers. assumptions become more certain that the attack is not feasible. the chance of success decreases as the number of participants increases. There is no exact figure. we should approach maximum decentralized limits from the technical feasibility perspective. So the certainty will never be 100%. the level of certainty may increase. The larger number of participants has been a good preventive measure before the attacks. If a participant has a minority power (perhaps only 10%) and thinks that other similar participants (9 other participants. each person with 10%) will behave honestly. then the dishonest behavior will not make any sense. If the participants have economic motives to behave honestly and do not know each others strategies. the high probability that the attack will not occur. Any attack has little chance of success. As the concentration increases. the risk also increases.',\n",
       " ' How to achieve high decentralization? It is a combination of economic encouragement. comprehensiveness and the ability to adjust the protocol if there is a problem that appears. which is management issue. The society is confusing and using decentralized systems because since ancient times we have lived in a hierarchical society. In many countries. we try to maintain democracy. This experience can be helpful for us. with Blockchain. everything will be more complicated because it is not possible to create a system that 1 person = 1 vote. The power in the network can be purchased with money. Wanted or not. Blockchain will tend to focus. As the number of users increases. the economic and social importance of blockchain for society will necessarily increase. The pressure to gain control of them will increase. We will have to make a lot of effort to get appropriate rules and incentives as well as keep the network as decentralized as possible. Certainly it is impossible to say that we have solved all decentralized issues. because of the low level of acceptance corresponding to the desire to dominate the network. An important test is in front of us.December 1. The application of blockchain technology is much slower than expected. In everyones efforts to provide more attractive services to users. the most important thing is often forgotten. Many projects even sacrificed decentralized to have higher TPS. It is important to remind people of the importance of decentralization and know what characteristics help distinguish blockchain from traditional financial services. This article will explain the characteristics of decentralized and its benefits for new people. We will focus on the most important things. The article will be divided into two parts. In the second part. we will consider whether people are interested in the benefits described or not and why the application is slow. The right to self -management and the ability to interact with each other in peer -to -peer network (P2P) is definitely one of the biggest benefits of decentralized decent. Blockchain users may exclusively own value without third parties and freely decide that value without being limited by anyone. P2P interaction allows participants to exchange value without intermediaries. which is basically direct. A similarity or transferring an object (such as an apple) from one hand to hand. It is important to emphasize that there is an intermediary between participants. namely a decentralized network or the application (Smart contract) originated from third parties. this is not an individual (who may fail or have control over the control). but a group of independent participants participating in the operation of a decentralized network. Blockchain must be considered a service without a single owner who has the right to control the processes performed by the network. Users based on the fact that most network operators will be honest and will behave according to the protocol rules or some types of social contracts based on decentralized principles. Against the censorship of transactions based on the assumption that if a participant consensuses the network (block producer) in the group deciding to censor a specific blockchain address.',\n",
       " ' other participants will not censor this address. A fraudulent participant can only partially limit the decentralized principles. Anyone can access the network and do not need to ask anyone permission. There is no contract between user and network operators (Pool operators. operators. What value do you can own and transfer?. In the case of the first generation blockchain like Bitcoin. this value is the original token. For example: BTC money. Users participate in a group of other participants. who share the meaning and importance of the Bitcoin network and these tokens are valid for them. these will be Ada tokens. The next generation of blockchain networks can do the same thing. what they can often do is create custom tokens and deploy applications (smart contracts). The value is not only limited to the local. Token can represent anything. such as the fiat currency. Application increases the interaction between users. Bitcoin is a transaction network that can send BTC unconditionally. P2P interaction is limited to sending money from address A to address B. The transfer of values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bbetween participants can be conditional. Smart contract platform (Smart Contract) will allow interaction between participants who do not know and trust each other. The most common interaction between participants is to exchange something for something. If both values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bare digital (two types of tokens) or the value can be encrypted (encoded assets as identified or stocks). the smart contract platform can ensure the interaction in which no party can deceive the other side. P2P self -management and interaction rights help people regain their asset. data and identity control. This will allow them to make decisions freely and less dependent on the surrounding environment. ie bank. status and other entities. Can use private services (Monero. Midnight) and thus hide your activities with the outside world. The surrounding world has almost no chance to learn about what you do with your property. most blockchain networks are transparent. All activities can be openly searched and can be detailed. This feature. along with decentralized properties to ensure the fairness of the system. All users (most) are equal and an individual cannot easily achieve significant advantages compared to other users. it is possible to prioritize your transactions for a higher fee (for blockchains with a charging market). but all network participants have this opportunity. It is almost impossible to get a more profitable or stealthy space in a way that others do not notice. Everyone has the same opportunity to use all the benefits of the Blockchain network. All users are similar to the Internet and can interact with each other. The ability to exchange non -intermediaries (no bank) is very important. This allows people to become a generation of chemicals. Anyone can create and deploy a new service (application) and become an entrepreneur. Everyone has the same chance of success. It is not necessary to ask someone permission to do business. Although this may vary according to the regulations. but now. the truth is that DEFI is not limited in any form (there is an exception.',\n",
       " ' the developer Tornado Cash is in prison). decentralized applications (smart contracts are deployed) expanding the ability to interact with P2P mutuals among participants. This group may also include the second layer. which may be less centralized but may expand. This will allow participants to interact more often. faster and cheaper. Concentration may have many hidden forms. Capital accumulation on a single node or smart contract is one of these forms. A decentralized system should not have a single error point. to achieve higher efficiency. it is necessary to have certain compromises. On decentralized exchanges (DEX). large capital is kept in liquidity pools. This may be a potential weakness of decentralization (ie a single failure). If someone tries to hack smart contracts (or some other types of errors). many users will be more harmful. The second layer has similar problems with lower decentralized levels. New concepts are appearing in the Cardano ecosystem that allows creating dex without having to accumulate capital in one place. This will significantly increase the security of the system because hackers suddenly have no weaknesses for them to attack. We will talk more about this in the second part. The transaction network basically only allows pushing the value from one address to another. The application allows developers to easily create decentralized depository services with pre -programmed behaviors. This helps to create a reliable autonomous value supervision. This supervisor may evaluate pre -programmed conditions and perform defined actions. A value can be kept and sent to a conditional address. these two seemingly small functions will significantly expand decentralized ability. it can be replicated with many financial services. An important aspect is the immutability of the defined rules. This is especially applied to the functions of the Blockchain network. self -management. monetary policy of the project and transferring value via the original code implemented in full nodes. In most cases. this also applies to applications. but it is necessary to pay attention to the details. it is impossible to change the function of smart contracts. Blockchain network is everywhere like the Internet. This means that it connects everyone on the planet with access to the Internet. Banks or services operating in markets in developed countries may not be interested in operating in developing countries. Blockchain does not make a difference. DEFI service on Blockchain is available everywhere in the world. Anyone can start using coded dollars. saving by BTC. Stake Ada. borrowing money. transactions on DEX. Blockchain is a decentralized network. It includes many nodes operated by people around the world (usually nodes are operated from developed countries). Blockchain network can fight off attacks and hacks very high. Most blockchain networks can easily resist DDOS attacks. High durability is due to the decentralization of the network. Blockchain service is available 24/7/365. The risk of failure exists but very low. There is a global market available from anywhere in the world and can participate in freedom (not limited) in any form as a user or businessman is one of the significant benefits of this technology.',\n",
       " ' In the next section of the article. we will focus on solvency and potential in financial services. A huge advantage of the Blockchain network is that the payment takes place quickly regardless of the national border. It will not matter if you send a value to a friend living next to them or if they are in another continent. The fee and settlement time will be the same. This advantage is seriously limited by the ability to expand blockchain. The theme of the article is the benefit. We will resolve shortcomings in the second part. The replacement of human labor. especially bank employees. by automation processes can be another great advantage. Token on Blockchain and smart contracts can replace old paperwork. This brings many benefits including removing conflicts and delays. rationalizing services and reducing partnerships. Automatic processes can be more effective and reliable than humans. These advantages can be used for transactions. clearing and global payments. consumer banks and loans. This can also be used outside the financial sector. Not only ordinary users but also large banks can benefit from the available systems globally. The blockchain industry is still very young. the automation of financial processes on decentralized blockchain is used by retailers in the field called DEFI (decentralized financial). A decentralization is considered an important feature related to faith. whether in the relationship between people or in the relationship between people and the organization. Blockchain is sometimes called a reliable machine. It is a new class of the Internet for trust. The trust of the people has been abused many times in the past and so far. Control people also have more power and often have more options. Blockchain technology has great potential to change the activity of society correctly because it changes the rules of play about what is essential to society. belief. The ability to generate non -state money is unique. Can take another step. Can build decentralized financial services or even a better new version of state organizations. this is an ambitious goal and may not be achieved. the idea of \\\\u200b\\\\u200bsuccess is very attractive. no one knows when Blockchain technology will change society and how much this change may be. It is most likely a gradual change similar to the application of the Internet. The faster application is hindered by some technological shortcomings. the law is missing or unclear and some things. We will talk about it next time. I discussed the most important benefits of blockchain technology. We will speak more closely in the details in the next section. We will explain why. at first sight. this wonderful technology is not applied more. We will focus on the limitations and shortcomings of Blockchain as well as the things that some people criticize. See more article part II here. Managers are trying to divide different Crypto projects into goods and securities. All Crypto is a digital property recorded in the blockchain. no crypto type can become a commodity. as digital assets cannot exist without protocols.',\n",
       " ' It is meaningless when BTC is labeled as a commodity but another coin like ADA is labeled as securities. Bitcoin is sometimes called digital gold. This is to evoke the impression that it has the same characteristics as gold. Can BTC money are goods in the sense that people often see the goods?. Considering BTC as a commodity with some shortcomings. Crypto is not a material like gold or coal. The creation of gold along with other heavy elements is an event in the industry. Crypto has a very short history. Basically it is technology. more specifically the protocols. That is the result of human ingenuity. You can touch gold and put it in your pocket. Digital money is virtual. It is basically a number written on the Internet. Goods always exist independently of the surrounding environment. It could not suddenly disappear from the world. The existence of BTC and ADA money is currently dependent on protocols. ie pools. people. electricity. computers and the Internet. The difference can be understood in the context of long -term economic sustainability of the Blockchain network. Goods have that. Gold may be in the ground in the form of raw or in the form of a gold brick in the bank. Regardless of what happens. the status of the goods will not change. Digital currency exists only when there are specific conditions. A decentralized network must create new blocks to verify the existence of money and do something specific to them. people want to spend them. send them to another blockchain address. The production of blocks depends on electricity and internet. people receive economic encouragement to run adequate nodes and produce blocks as well as groups to maintain protocols. You have a gold ring on your finger. Imagine what the situation will be if you have to pay forever to miners to exploit your ring for your ring. what happened 20 years ago. A item does not work that way. After the exploitation of gold exploits and sells it. the goods will be independent of the operator. Miners can go bankrupt. If you exploit less gold. the value of the goods on the market will increase as it will become rarer. Your ring does not depend on the economic situation of the miner. They can even go bankrupt. BTC token works completely opposite. Your wealth forever depends on the network to create blocks. The operator must consume electricity and receive a large enough reward from the Bitcoin protocol. The Internet must operate. The management agency cannot be forced to block the Bitcoin protocol at the cyber level. The group must not miss a serious vulnerability in the source code or introduce a new hole. In the case of holding BTC and ADA coins. you cannot get a peaceful sleep. You have to worry about security. long -term economic sustainability. quality of the team. These concerns do not exist in the case of gold. Miners or other cases may permanently limit your ability to spend money for many reasons.',\n",
       " ' The fee may be high. The regulator can put your blockchain address on the black list. You can keep the so -called dirty BTC. If the blockchain stops producing blocks for any reason for a long time. the token may lose relatively quickly. It can be said that virtual currencies will basically disappear from the world. You may hope that the incident will be overcome and blockchain will start producing blocks. such incidents may have a negative impact on the market price of tokens. The gold ring will always be approximately each other over time and similar incidents can never occur. If someone steals your gold ring. that will not affect the value of any other ring. if you protect your gold ring. it will always be valuable. It is impossible to guarantee long -term and independent existence of Cryptos environment. And I believe that Crypto cannot be considered a commodity. The existing dependence of digital money on the protocol causes significant risks that we cannot observe for ordinary goods. I believe ADA and BTC are basically the same digital assets. They are all new assets. Try asking how American dollar is different from Euro or Yen? They are all the Fiat currency. They exist in the form of material (tokens and paper money). but today is mainly in the form of digital. They are the numbers on the server. It is completely meaningless to say that USD is a commodity and EUR is securities. I feel that in the case of Crypto. the management agencies as well as some crypto fans are trying to find the difference they cannot find. Crypto is mainly a technology for finance. They differ mainly in the following characteristics:. Bitcoin is a trading network with limited options to execute the instructions. I do not think that flexibility and higher possibility is the basic difference that allows a project to be considered a commodity and the other project is stock. What Cardano can do in the first class today. Bitcoin can do on the second or even the first class in the future. Bitcoin has an optional token (including NFT) on the first layer and they can easily become the encrypted Fiat currency. From the outside point of view. finding the difference is meaningless. Sometimes it is said that BTC is a commodity because the exploitation requires a huge energy. Energy demand is determined by the consensus characteristics of POW. electricity and other resources are consumed by all blockchain networks. Electricity is necessary to run a full node. Cardano (including tokens) will not exist without energy consumption. The difference only lies in energy consumption. Cardano saves more than 99% energy than Bitcoin. Is the higher efficiency is the reason for BTC to be considered a commodity and ADA is securities? Should we determine the consumption threshold to exceed so that a token becomes a commodity? There is no meaning. Energy consumption is an important aspect in the context of long -term economic sustainability of the project.',\n",
       " ' The existence of tokens depends on whether the protocol can ensure security or not. Ideally forever. this cannot be guaranteed without the potential changes to the projects monetary protocol or monetary policy!. The existence of tokens is prescribed by the security of the protocol. in case Bitcoin is prescribed by the ability to pay reward. the reward will be reduced half every 4 years. The security of Bitcoin is not stable but it may increase or decrease. Someday it can decrease so low that someone can successfully attack the protocol or people will lose faith. As I wrote in the first paragraph. the uncertainty of the development of future security (or the phenomenon called the privacy budget) is not what we think of a commodity. By the way. Cardano has a certain advantage in this way. because the lower energy consumption is a good prerequisite to extend life. like any other blockchain. will only exist if it can ensure economic sustainability. This can only be done if the protocol will develop prosperous economically. it will have revenue (user fee). The biggest difference lies in the original distribution at the beginning. This topic is a very thin layer of ice. Temporarily forget the states and regulates. I think any project can be implemented in any way as long as the community accepts it. There is no key or instructions that are suitable for everyone about the only way that can be done. It is impossible to argue that Bitcoin is the only thing to do right. They said that Ada must be a stock because the group is selling tokens. Please ignore the details that the Cardano community certainly knows. The development of a complex project like Cardano must be sponsored from something. It is fair to get a reward when making a project like Cardano. All BTC tokens must be exploited. But Satoshi and his friends from the beginning have exploited a huge amount of BTC. There are rumors that Satoshi has not sold BTC. but we dont know for sure. We dont even know who else has exploited valuable tokens from the beginning. It can be said that even Satoshi has received a worthy reward when delivering Bitcoin. What will happen if Satoshi sells BTC? And he earns a lot of money from it as other members in the group (potential) or friends. But the basic question is whether this event has changed the view of Bitcoin from a legal perspective?. The question is how to exploit BTC right after the launch of Bitcoin can be compared to the sale of ADA before launching Cardano?. that is possible. I see the same principle: low buying and selling high. ADA can be purchased directly (via vouchers and only in Asia). while to exploit BTC. it is necessary to have hardware (initially just a laptop) and cover energy costs. the principle is still the same. everyone is interested in profits. How is the operation of the miners from the activity of the first money buyers?.',\n",
       " ' All blockchain projects have a team and leaders. Do not be deceived that Satoshi left Bitcoin and had no lead. Satoshi handed over the project management right to Gavin Andresen. who gave it to Pieter Wuille again. Gavin Andresen founded the Bitcoin fund and even had a debate between the Fund and the US regulators more than 10 years ago. If you still believe that Bitcoin does not have an address. believe that it has been there for a long time. Bitcoin has many developers working for companies sponsored by VC Fund or by donations from crypto companies or enrichers thanks to BTC. these companies have CEOs. For example: Adam Back is the CEO of BlockStream. It is not fair to say that Cardano has a group led by Charles Hoskinson and Bitcoin has no group because Satoshi has left the project. This is a terrible and meaningless act of fake ethics because without the Bitcind team will not exist here. Bitcoin has some serious errors that have been fixed in the past. They were found by white hats and revealed to the development group through private channels. The IOG group is responsible for the cardano protocol. A small group of core developers responsible for Bitcoin. The argument that `` Satoshi left was meaningless. because his role was naturally undertaken by others. Whoever says the opposite is not knowing what the command line is and what the source code is. We can talk about the transparency of the project or the degree of frequency and the way the communication group is. this does not change the fact that behind each protocol always has a group and someone (a small group) makes a decision. If the decision on what is the goods depends on the existence of a group. then believe that all blockchain projects have a group. the Bitcoin community has changed a lot since Satoshi left the project. Almost nothing left of the initial ideals. Bitcoin worshipers are friends of status representatives and advise regulators (thought to be bribes) on how they should adjust crypto. we could observe the efforts to enforce a law. which clearly stated that POW was a permitted consensus mechanism and POS should be banned. This is an example. I am not a lawyer. I clearly see that different regulatory agencies and organizations can label digital assets as goods or securities. based on how it fits their box. I feel positive when crypto experts and project representatives are contacting the legislators and explaining complicated concepts for them. Crypto is a new type of asset and needs to prepare a new box for them. But I dont understand why OG Crypto and Bitcoin devourers only try to promote Bitcoin and try to ban everything else. A better and more free world cannot be built on the basis of banning competition. Such a world will not be free. Freedom is the choice and the ability to participate at any time. but can also leave. The new world order is built on blockchain technology that cannot be built through competitive and legal ban on a project.',\n",
       " ' There have been such efforts in history and it has never been well. The basic principles are gradually disappearing from the crypto industry. If we lose them. the whole industry will lose its existence. Despite the fact that the new traitors of Cyberpunk appeared. it is necessary to persevere in decentralized principles. If you look at Crypto in the usual way. you cannot call any of the money of them. Digital assets on Blockchain are very similar and different in small technology details. the continuous innovation is made. So what the application today can be completely different tomorrow. The law from the last century was written by people who did not know anything about the Internet could not be used to manage crypto. Crypto is also not securities. It can be claimed that a project responds to definitions based on some facts or events. For me. the division of crypto into many different types of assets seems to be an innocent effort as if you want to do the same with the Fiat or fruit currency. With all respect for Satoshi. cultivators should realize that Bitcoin is basically no exception. It is simply a technology that others imitate and improve. It is the path to freedom. Limiting free choice is a dictatorial regime.November 28. DDOS attacks are a significant threat to online services. The main goal of the attacks is to make a service unable to use. Cardano can be considered as an online service. It provides a platform to perform smart contracts. money transfer and other functions via the Internet. Like any online service. theoretically. it can become the target of a DDOS attack. due to the decentralized nature and the security measures are applied. it can better recover from such attacks compared to traditional online services. Read about Cardanos ability to fight DDOS attacks. The attack on decentralized service (DDOS) is a toxic effort to break the normal activity of networks. services or servers by overwhelming it with a large amount of internet traffic. This is also known as sending garbage transactions online. The attackers (or even garbage transactions) try to create similar traffic (e. transactions) looks similar to the usual traffic from users. This means that spam transactions are mixed with user transactions. the terms of garbage transactions are used for attackers transactions. This is not an email spam. These attacks operate by using multiple computer systems (botnets) invaded as an attack source. Machines may include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices. When the victims server is targeted by the botnets. each BOT will send a large amount to the targets IP address. which can cause the server to be overloaded and lead to the refusal of the service for normal traffic. The server is usually sized for a certain amount of flow. The garbage trading volume will increase significantly and suddenly traffic. The main goal of DDOS attacks is to make a service (temporary) not available. This is often achieved by depleting server resources that are targeted.',\n",
       " ' forcing it to restart or overload the communication channel to isolate the server. Trac traces traffic consumes resources similar to normal traffic. the server may not have resources. DDOS attacks can cause serious decline for online services. When an attack is going on. users cannot use the service normally. The most obvious symptom of the DDOS attack is the site or service that suddenly becomes slow or not available. This can lead to significant financial losses and reputation for businesses. The need to protect from DDOS attacks is the most important thing in todays digital era. The main mechanisms to protect against DDOS attacks include:. If a successful DDOS attack occurs. it can often be stopped after a few hours (day) so that the service can work again. Cardano has taken some measures to minimize the risks of DDOS attacks. They include transaction fees to prevent sending garbage transactions into the network in large quantities of transactions. protocols on demand to control data speed to each node and transition authentication to check transactions before transferring them. The decentralization of the network (mainly the number of nodes) is also an important factor. Cardano can resist DDOS attacks for the following reasons:. Explain some basic defense mechanisms. In a DDOS attack. the attacker often overwhelms a target with a large amount of internet traffic. Cardano is a decentralized network consisting of a large number of nodes. Cardano has no failure. The attacker will need to significantly overwhelm the nodes by spam transactions to break the network. The best way to prevent DDOS attacks is decentralized. Cardano has about 3k pool and each pool has 2-3 relay nodes. Pool are blocks that are hidden behind the relay nodes. Cardano attack is a challenge because it is necessary to attack about 10k node. Pool Stake (SPO) operators can configure their nodes to interact directly with each other. This means that blocks that can be connected to both their own reliability relays and other relay nodes are operated by other spo. SPO determines which network nodes will communicate. Network configuration can be changed at any time. Attacking a block producing block basically the attack of some relay nodes. the block production node is not a public display node (meaning even for attackers). blocks and transactions are decentralized by P2P method. New transactions are included in Mem-Pool. this is a type of waiting room where they wait to be inserted into one of the next blocks. Each node manages its own mem-pool. The content of memes in the network changes when transactions spread from a node in a specific position to other nodes in the network. Slot Leader is randomly elected by the scale. Slot Leaders receive transactions from their mem-pool and create a new block. The attacker who does not know the next new block will be created in the network. The attacker cannot simply issue many transactions to a selected node (as in a regular DDOS attack). Transactions cannot be pushed to node. The nodes pull transactions from their peer -to -peer network nodes.',\n",
       " ' This fact. combined with the Pool operators determine which peer -to -peer network nodes are connected. showing a powerful protection mechanism. Only valid transactions are popular in the network. When users send a transaction from their wallet. that transaction is always processed by a node. This is not necessarily a node that produces blocks (pool). Valid transactions are inserted into mem-pool. The invalid transactions will be removed immediately and they are no longer distributed. If a node sends an invalid transaction or continuously sends the same transaction. connecting to that node will be closed. Before transactions are transferred. the title/content will be tested according to the rule. This mechanism helps prevent a node from flooding the network in large quantities of transactions. If the attacker wants to spam network. he must first fill in his own mem-pool. it can fill the Nodes mem-pool that is connected to the wallet. From this node. transactions can be decentralized to other nodes. If they are valid. the node will put them in mem-pool. Node can detect spam node and disconnect with that node. It can be said that the nodes use the same strategy as the server. ie speed limit. nodes are responsible for the speed of trading. Cardano protocols are designed in style. The protocol parameters limit the amount of network resources that Node can consume. For each node and each peer -to -peer node is connected to that node. that node will control the incoming data speed. the ability to process simultaneously and the amount of data remains. If the Node operator changes the protocol parallel parameter to allow the speed of the transaction rate to be higher than the speed determined by the protocol parallel. the network will consider it as a garbage transaction. This prevents an equivalent opponent from conducting a resource -consuming attack. If a peer -to -peer network follows the protocols. its ability to consume resources at its node will be limited. If it violates they will be disconnected. peer -to -peer network nodes will disconnect with this fraud node. If the attacker wants to spam network from a position. colleagues will stop taking transactions from there. It is clear that the decentralized network cannot be attacked from a single position. The next point I will describe is very important. Need to attack multiple nodes at the same time. If the attacker wants to slow down the network significantly or cause a more serious incident. it is necessary to attack almost all nodes at the same time. The nodes take transactions from all peer-to-peer-to-peer network nodes. so they insert common user transactions as well as spam transactions (valid) into mem-pool. User transactions and spam transactions will start competing to gain a position in mem-pool (2 times larger than block size). Mem-Pool of attacked nodes will contain spam transactions. but non-attacked nodes will contain user transactions. Depending on who becomes the next slot leader. there will be more spam transactions or user transactions in the block. If the attacker does not attack all nodes at the same time.',\n",
       " ' he will not have the opportunity to prevent user transactions from accessing any mem-pool in the network. Mem-Pool that the attacker must spam with transactions is not the size of a mem-pool. but basically the memory size of all memes in the network combined. Mem-Pool can contain about 11 transactions. each transaction size 16k byte. It will cost at least 0. 86 ADA to send such a transaction. It will cost at least 10 ADA to fill Mem-Pool. Cardano consists of 10k node and each node has a 2-block mem-pool. Filling all memes with unique transactions at the same time will ask to create 110k transactions. The attacker will pay 95k ADA. If the attacker manages to connect fake nodes to all nodes (honestly) in the network and fill the mem-pool with spam transactions. the users transactions will have difficulty entering Mem-Pool. I dare to say that in reality it is unrealistic. I repeat that 110k transactions are the maximum number. users can observe the network is slow if the attacker fills some memes with spam transactions. The more mem-pool is attacked. the slower the network will be. The attacker can easily send more garbage transactions just a part of the nodes and hope that garbage transactions will be diffused to some memes. He could gradually send back to another series of trash transactions. Network (all nodes) will delete the authentic transactions in mem-pool whenever a new block is created. each mem-pool may contain different transactions. It is important that the number of transactions in Mem-Pool will tend to decrease if the attacker does not create new spam transactions. The nodes do not distinguish between spam transactions and user transactions. As long as they are valid (including paid fees). they will be processed. The transactions that are authenticated in the new block will be deleted from the mem-pool. If transactions are not unique. the new block will activate the cleaning of transactions in Mem-Pool on multiple nodes (only half the size of mem-pool will be released by a single block). Garbage transactions are not unique to the less effective attack. It is necessary to add additional transactions to Mem-Pool more often. In order for the attacker to enhance the impact of the attack. he will have to arrange some way for his transactions to be included in Mem-Pool before the users transactions (that is. to give them priority). this is not an easy task at all. the attacker will have to stay close to the nodes he is attacking geographically as possible (due to network latency). There are also cases. node operators can resist an attack. Pool operators can easily detect the attack and they can easily make Mem-Pool drums. they will increase the chance of user transactions into Mem-Pool. The attacker will have to send back garbage transactions. this will only cause the network to lose connection with spam nodes. Pool operators can automatically decide to disconnect from garbage nodes or viagic transactions. The removal of spam node is relatively simple and only maintains connection with reliable nodes.',\n",
       " ' In order for the attack to successfully trade garbage. the attacker needs to have access to all memes of the network in an equal and immediately. This is difficult to achieve in reality. I can imagine that the attacker can slow the network. it can try to turn off the specific nodes that users often use. The slowdown of the network can be annoying if users need their transactions to be completed quickly because they are at risk of liquidating their position for example. Cardano network had been under a lot of pressure. due to the creation of NFT or testing the ability to resist DDOS attacks. The largest download I heard is 44 times higher than the network capacity (downloading about 250k new transactions in an hour). Most users dont even notice this delay. If it is easy to perform a DDOS attack on Cardano or another blockchain. we will see these daily attacks. It does not happen. Believe me. preparing and making such an attack is not easy at all.November 27. Many hacks on the Ethereum platform have used flash loans (fast loans). The attacker can borrow a huge amount of money without mortgage. use that money to make a profit and then repay the loan in the same transaction. we will explain why we dont see this type of attack in Cardanos DEFI. You will understand one of the advantages of the UTXO model. Quick loan is a loan and is repaid in the same transaction. It is a way to make a significant profit without having to risk your own money. Most of us are familiar with the usual loans. The lender lendes the borrower so that it will eventually be fully returned. A loan usually has to be paid regularly for a few months or years. the lender requires the borrower to mortgage the property to secure that if the borrower cannot pay the loan. the lender can still get their money back. This is a guaranteed loan. Flash loans are not guaranteed because there is no need for collateral. The lack of mortgage property does not mean that the lender will not get the money back. Instead of giving collateral. borrowers need to pay back immediately. This can be guaranteed with a smart contract. A fast loan is immediately. By taking advantage of the automatic transactions on Ethereum. fast loans allow users to perform many actions in a transaction. as the time of transaction time does not exceed the block time. This automatic concept is very important for the operation of fast loans. Smart contracts for fast loans usually include loans. a number of activities (such as price difference or liquidation) and then repaying the loan. all in just one transaction. If the loan is not refunded at the end of the transaction. the entire transaction will be reversed and considered an unprecedented loan. This ensures that the lender does not lose money. even when the loan is not mortgaged. automatically ensures all the properties of all or nothing of the transaction.',\n",
       " ' It is best to explain with an example. Suppose we have three parties: Loan protocol (a). borrowers (B) and the target protocol C. Three actions take place in a single transaction: borrowing. action and repayment. At the end of the transaction. it seems that the money has not been borrowed. Smart contracts on Ethereum may be complex autonomous programs that can perform many activities and interact with other contracts. This allows to perform complex interactions between many smart contracts in a single transaction. this is the main requirement to make fast loans. Also note that in fast loan transactions. there are many relevant balances. Each balance can be debit and recorded many times in a transaction. Many of these concepts are basically different from the simplicity of the Plutus and UTXO models. This is why there is no Loan Loan attack on Cardano. The purpose and function of the authentication sets on Cardano and smart contracts on Ethereum are different and this affects the implementation of fast loans. The authentication instructions on Cardano are used to determine whether UTXO spending can be spent. They do this by checking whether certain conditions are responded. If the conditions are not met. the transaction will not be authenticated and the UTXO has not been used. One of the other reasons for Cardano to be more secure than the UTXO model. Each UTXO is a separate object. independent of the surrounding environment. The UTXO model has no concept of balance. like an account -based model used by Ethereum. One or more UTXO can be the input of a transaction they can only be used once and completely. New output UTXOs will be created from input UTXOs. Cardano transactions can be considered as a simple function to consume the first UTXO to produce output UTXO. Utxo participating in the transaction is immutable and can ensure monopoly access. In transactions. ensure that the value of all input UTXO is similar to the value of all output UTXOs (this is also the condition of the smart contract to perform fast loans). transactions have a state. they can change the status of the system. This is a prerequisite for complex interactions between many smart contracts in a transaction. The UTXO model has no status. During the transaction authentication process. the instruction set only has access to the input UTXO. the transaction context. Datum and Redemer. the instruction set can not interact with other UTXOs in the system. The main difference between Cardano and Ethereum is that UTXO can not move many times to different addresses during the Plutus command verification process. Cardano supports a series of smart contracts in a transaction. They can be string in a range of transactions. Cardano processes simultaneously operations in a transaction. A single cardano transaction shows an activity that occurs simultaneously rather than chain. This means that the traditional concept of fast loans on Ethereum. where the money is borrowed and refunded in a transaction. does not transfer directly to Cardano due to these limitations.',\n",
       " ' Can not create fast loans on Cardano because it is necessary to use many transactions to borrow money. use money and refund money activities. By design. Cardano does not allow users to create flash loans. Can somehow create a fast loan on Cardano?. The logic of the authentication command will have to be as follows: Allowing this UTXO to be used on the condition that it is re -used with the same set of commands. this does not make sense. UTXO cannot be temporarily borrowed in a transaction. Partners will not be able to use UTXO. we talk about flash loans negatively because they are often used to attack. fast loans are a powerful tool for traders with necessary technical skills and knowledge. The same thing can be told to Ethereum. For some cases of use. the advantage is that developers can string smart contracts in a transaction. The smart contract platform is a tool and they can be used to build useful financial services or be exploited by hackers. The goal of the whole industry is to create such a platform to create safe and reliable services. Cardano is safely designed. but some things are more effort and more complicated when done compared to Ethereum. This is always looking for the right balance. Bitcoin uses UTXO accounting model. For the IOG group. this model is not enough for the cardano mission. so they expanded it. Cardano uses extended utxo. we will explain the meaning of the extended word. Bitcoin network is designed for payment. Bitcoins UTXO model may express limited programming. Cardano is a smart contract platform that allows developers to carry out more valuable activities. working with UTXO. The extension of the UTXO model is related to the following properties:. Bitcoin cannot provide these characteristics or only a very limited level. Bitcoin is designed as a basic transaction network that only authenticates key to verifying spending conditions. Bitcoin is not consistent with more complex financial activities. to perform smart contracts. an address is created by the general chopper. This process is called public lock. When someone sends BTC to an address. basically they are locking it by the common key linked to that address. In order to spend the BTC locked at a specific address. the owner of that address must be unlocked by providing electronic signatures. This signature is created by a separate key associated with the general key of the address. The act of signing transactions by separate key will unlock BTC effectively. allowing spending. an address can be linked to a set of instructions but in a specific way. Bitcoin has a few different instructions. of which Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) is the most popular. Bitcoin commands (small code/program code) are embedded in the output of the transaction. When you create a transaction. basically you are writing a set of commands (the code indicates the spending conditions). To deploy the instructions. you will combine that instruction into Bitcoin transaction. You will often encounter these scripts:. And although the Bitcoin address can be linked to the instructions.',\n",
       " ' they are often locked with a specific general key and does not contain customized logic in the form of a set of (smart). The instructions are mainly used to authenticate the key. The instructions are not stored separately on the Blockchain for reuse. each transaction includes its own instructions. And although you can definitely use the same command in many transactions. each version of the instructions will be stored separately as part of the corresponding transaction. There is no one -time command storage mechanism on Blockchain and then refer to that instruction in many transactions. Bitcoin script has no concept of state. All necessary information is in the locking and unlocking sets. This means that the instructions have no status and do not store any information between execution. The instructions are almost only used to lock and unlock BTC. UTXO is used to store and trade BTC value. Each UTXO represents a certain amount of BTC that has been sent to a specific address. It is impossible to create a new (exclusive) new (monopoly) UTXO for customized tokens with its own value. You may have heard that Bitcoin may have tokens in the first class. The first time is called the color token. It is about linking specific satoshi with custom tokens. This turns them into tokens effectively. which can be used to represent anything. It should be noted that this is not the token in the true sense of this word. There may be a UTXO with 1000 satoshi. of which 10 satoshi is colored as X. This concept was not feasible. The concept of Ordinals is somewhat similar to the concept of color tokens but there are some main differences. The order number is Satoshi has been arranged and recorded with a part of information. such as text or images. This information makes the SAT unique and turns it into an irreplaceable token (NFT) in reality. Bitcoin can be described simply as a single asset ledger. Bitcoin instructions are not state and are mainly used to authenticate signatures (locks). The instructions are transferred in transactions and cannot be stored in the blockchain and reuse. In the expanded UTXO model. the concept of address is generalized. Instead of limiting lock for general and locked locks for signatures. addresses in the EUTXO model can (indirectly) contain customized logic in the form of a set of instructions. This means that instead of the hash version of the general key. the addresses in Cardano can be linked to the instructions through the command hash function in the address. This allows for more complex transactions and interactions. such as the necessary transactions for smart contracts. An address that can contain the hash function of the command is used to determine the instructions that have been stored in the blockchain. And in Cardano. a transaction may contain and refer to the instructions. Bitcoin cannot refer to the instructions. And the instructions must always be transacted. Cardano can refer to the instructions. These reference instructions are attached to the output and may be used to meet the requirements of the instructions during the authentication process.',\n",
       " ' This means that transactions that use the common instructions may be much smaller. Trading using the command will not need to provide that instruction. as long as it refers to the output containing the instructions. The concept of the reference command is related to the continuous aspect of the expanded UTXO model of Cardano. The continuity of the contract ensures that the same contract code can be used for a chain of transactions. The Plutus platform allows developers to write apps (instructions) interacting with Blockchain Cardano. Plutus programming language developed from Haskell. Plutus instructions are the code that performs pure or wrong output functions. They are used to confirm the action. the authentication command is transmitted three arguments:. Cardanos Eutxo model allows developers to write status instructions through the use of these primitive. Datum can be used to monitor the status of the command. Datum plays an important role in the use of output UTXO from the command address and sends it to the set of instructions. you can link a status to the set by using Datum. The expression and programming ability of the Plutus instruction set allows developers to deploy many types of logic. a simple verification command can check if a specific key is signed with spending transactions (this is similar to the bitcoin command). with a little carefully expanding. developers can use the instructions to express more complicated logic. The use of Datum and Redeemer further enhances the ability of these instructions. allowing them to carry the status and accept the input from the spending. The instructions may take the values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bof datum and Redemer. perform calculations or comparisons. then export a boolean value (determine spending ability). Cardano ledger is designed to support many assets. It is called a multi -property ledger. It allows cardano to perform accounting or trading with a variety of assets (original ada copper). When the token is cast. the new UTXO will be created. When users create tokens. they are basically creating new UTXOs containing these tokens. These UTXOs can then be used in transactions. like UTXO with ADA. Plutus instructions can work with the identical token as with ADA. Cardano can be described simply as a multi -property ledger. Casting token is a new UTXO with the same characteristics as ADA. Plutus instructions have status. Commands operate with the context of Datum. Redemer and transactions. allowing developers to create more complicated logic (in addition to the lock verification). The instructions can be stored in the ledger and are referenced many times. The UTXO model also has another important meaning that has not been mentioned in the article. the ability to expand is higher. Utxo is basically independent of the surrounding environment. Transactions with UTXO can be verified regardless of other UTXOs (ie basically regardless of other user transactions). another feature that the UTXO model supports is parallel. This feature will be used by an improvement called the Input Endorser. Perhaps the biggest difference between Bitcoin UTXO and Cardano UTXO is the ability to add datum.',\n",
       " ' custom data. Although many differences are described in a somewhat related to UTXO. they differ mainly due to different philosophy and designs of the two projects. If the data can be added to Bitcoin UTXO. it is necessary to expand Bitcoin Script. The stored data will be more helpful if it can be compared to something. ideally some of the Redemer. The ability to cast UTXO is a feature that Bitcoin has no intentional. Such considerations may be further. Blockchain consists of many components with attributes that form a whole. Utxo is one of these components. The use of the potential of the accounting model depends on other components. The potential of Extended Utxo is related to the plutus platform. ledger.November 24. Midnight resolves a long -term challenge of data security in blockchain by providing developers with the necessary tools to create safe smart contracts and comply with regulations without having to sacrifice blockchain technology is all about transparency and decentralization. It is about the distribution of information on a network of peer -to -peer network nodes. which helps the system to speak against opposing behaviors. But there is an interesting tough question here. Although transparency is one of the design principles of blockchain. how to maintain the security of data when information. can be visible to hundreds. even thousands of nodes? This issue is especially related to smart contracts. often processing sensitive data and creating super data can also be correlated to reveal other sensitive details. developers have some optional options to use. often related to coding. to support data security in their smart contracts. Although some of these techniques meet some definitions of data integrity. they may require excessive dependence on the assumptions of reliability. which may limit the decentralized level that can be achieved. leading to unwanted trade -offs. To solve this challenge. Midnight introduces smart contracts that allow the maintenance of user and organization data security without having to sacrifice decentralized. Midnight smart contracts also provide developer developers with programming security so they can comply with the regulations. This blog discovers smart contracts on Midnight. providing a senior overview of the protocol. Midnight smart contract provides data security solutions that allow developers to achieve data security functions and smart contract functions for common purposes without having to sacrifice decentralized characteristics. Midnight contract takes advantage of the principles stated in the article Kachina: The foundation of a private smart contract. The reaction status machine and replicated. Solving the tough questions about security in the context of the blockchain and intelligent contract requires a solution to achieve security guarantee while maintaining decentralization and avoiding additional reliable assumptions. Other blockchain networks often implement smart contracts in the form of a copied status machine. which means that the natural model is the model of the status machine itself. This also means that input information is drawn from the transaction ledger and is transferred to this status machine. This implementation has a big drawback from the security perspective. If the behavior of the status is known and input information is recorded in the ledger.',\n",
       " ' the security will not exist. To solve this problem. Midnight modeled smart contracts as a more comprehensive status machine. including the local system. only part of them were copied by sending trading to the Midnight Blockchain in this deployment). Smart contract function simply tracks the identification numbers of the corresponding input. The uniqueness of the Midnight smart contract protocol. Midnight provides a practical protocol to realize infinite data security contracts. using zero-knowledge evidence (zero-knowledge snark). allowing one party to prove that a statement or statement is certain without disclosing sensitive content or data behind that statement. This protocol has four main contributions to the data security system:. The core idea of \\\\u200b\\\\u200bthe protocol is to separate the status of smart contracts into two parts: general state. public (public blockchain) and local state. off-chain. individual for each contract. the status refers to current data or information stored in smart contracts. Status represents the value of variables. storage positions and all other relevant information necessary for the implementation and operation of smart contracts. The status may include the fact that an action has been completed. In Midnight. the contract itself can update both the state of publicity and privacy. The contracting parties use knowledge to create evidence that the change of public status is valid. while maintaining privacy and input for this conversion process. The protocol then posted evidence and converted in the form of transactions. When the user starts a transaction. they intend to give a high level for a smart contract (for example: voting or withdrawing money). After the ledger confirms the transaction. the user will receive information about their command results and all the results are calculated based on the current state of the contract. Midnight enhances the efficiency of smart contracts through simultaneous operation. mention the possibility of many agents performing tasks simultaneously without blocking each other. This supports increasing the clearance and effective transactions as well as handling smart contracts. To activate simultaneous features. Midnight uses a record of the operations performed on the state of the contract and interacts with the queries. By optimizing conflict transactions and allowing rearrangement. Midnight minimizes leakage of information and maximizes simultaneous processing capacity. Experience the excellent development of data security and comply with the regulation are two of the most important design concerns for smart contract people and contracts to implement the contract. Providing developers with a solution to solve and solve these problems is the main difference of Midnight. the use of Midnight to create Dapps and smart contracts means easy to integrate Zero-Knowledge evidence. In a broader context. Midnight provides a creative programming model to help simplify the development process. Using TypeScript library and programming language for Midnights field. developers can develop smart contracts based on the Kachina protocol. a plug-in for Microsoft vs Code allows developers to work seamlessly with Blockchain Midnight. SDK Midnight offers all the necessary tools to build and run software. including compilation and runtimes. as well as simulation nodes. cli wallets and sample projects.',\n",
       " ' Midnight provides a strong environment for developers to create data security contracts easily. providing the necessary tools to build and run software as well as allow seamless integration with Blockchain. Potential use cases. Midnight smart contract model can be applied for many cases. including traditional financial applications (Tradfi) and decentralized financial (DEFI). identity management. supply chain management system. health care applications. Data security is the center of Midnight. Sensitive data security. both individual and commercial. use technology based on blockchain and password. The philosophy of this data security will support an environment that not only security is confidentiality but also the security of three basic freedoms: Association. Trade and Freedom of Speech for developers. companies and individuals. The number of frauds and ingenuity of the scammers in the crypto industry is endless. tens of thousands of people reported financial losses related to Crypto frauds with a total value of over 1 billion USD. In 2022. based on various sources. this figure is about 3 to 12 billion USD. Analysts estimated that by 2023. scammers will steal up to 16 billion USD. It is important to mention that the numbers may not be accurate because many people do not report fraud to the government. Do not be cheated. Reading the goals of fraud. what the scammers use and how to identify the fraud. people who are new to the world of crypto have little knowledge about how to store their assets safely. The desire to invest in a new industry combined with low knowledge about this technology is an appealing to the scammers. Blockchain transactions are irreversible and ignore the traditional financial system. It is convenient for scammers. fraud is one of the reasons why people avoid managing and holding digital assets on centralized trading floors. They do not want to become victims and believe that their property supervisors will not fall into the hands of scammers. All people who are interested in crypto should first get used to the basic principles of blockchain and buy hardware wallets. You should know how the most common types of crypto frauds work. this is an endless battle. because the scammers are very creative and constantly think of new and more sophisticated tricks. They use modern technologies including AI and always take one step ahead. The scammers know very well the characteristics and behaviors of people. They know which forms of attacks work. Scammers often create reasonable stories and characters that are not always able to activate your spam filter. They quickly exploit existing events to benefit. They may find out that you are waiting for the shipment. They will abuse it. such as by calling you and trying to get personal information from you. thinking that it is necessary for packaging delivery. Everyone is greedy. This quality of man can be exploited. The promise of high profits or `` something has no value can be very attractive. This is often found in frauds related to fake investment or lottery. we often see offers like sending your money to Blockchain X and I will send you back twice.',\n",
       " '  This type of fraud has been well known but it can still work effectively for new people. The scammers often create an urgent feeling. putting the pressure on the victim to act quickly before they have time to think or seek advice. If the attacker tries to make you act on your emotions. you will stop thinking properly. This is very dangerous. Emergency may be a sign of a fraud. Many people believe that they are too intelligent or knowledgeable to fall into scams. which can make them not prepare and risk. even the smartest people in us will fall into a trap of fraud. Always be better prepared than surprised (and being robbed). One of the characteristics of fraudulent attacks is to target as many people as possible. They often spam email mail boxes and social networks. They know that 99% of people will realize the fraud and no reaction. for them. success is if 1% of people respond. Please point out a current fraud that all people use the X platform may have seen. The scammers have commented on this fraud under almost every post from popular users (influential people). who have the potential to attract high viewers. The X platform promises to fight against BOT. X lost in this effort. Note that the scammers have some blue check marks (indicating he is a paid users). What does the crook give you? SYNCSWAP provides SYNC tokens. You are invited to check if you are eligible to receive some tokens. What do scammers want to achieve? It is very simple. Let you click on a fake link. Note that scammers are taking advantage of the Airdrop events have been publicly announced. SYNCSWAP is an existing service with SYNC token. The scammers are taking advantage of an existing event and hitting your greed. Miss. Scammers create fake Airdrops (or create a fake copy of the widely known AirDrops) to lure users to ask them. This is often involved in persuading users to connect their wallets to malicious contracts or sharing their private course. If you cant stand this attack. you will probably lose your property. The scammers almost always have a goal. Receive secret. sensitive or personal information from you. Many Crypto scams involved some types of impersonation. along with some carefully staged lies. often adjusted based on the victim they target. As we presented above. scammers can exploit existing events. One of the regular attacks is impersonation. The attackers impersonate the existing accounts on social networks (usually on the X platform) and try to promote some frauds through it. Its easy to create an account that looks similar to an existing account of a celebrity. such as Michael Saylor or Charles Hoskinson. If you are not sure about the message. always check if the account has a blue check sign and check the number of followers. check if that account name is misspelled. The account name must be unique. The attackers are forced to change the account name. at least one character.',\n",
       " ' The same thing is applied to URLs. The attackers like to take advantage of your lack of attention. The most common DEX in the Cardano ecosystem is Minswap. But what is the URL? Many people may not remember that. They access Google and want to find DEX. Google can display them a fake URL on DEX that looks like Minswap. It will be convenient to remember the URL of the services you use or save links. Scammers may not attack indirectly through social networks but also direct attacks. such as by sending you an email with a reasonable story. They can even call or text you. In case of email. people rely on frauds to be automatically filtered out. people tend to interact with email. You can get an email from the trading floor or hazardous wallet you use with the request that your money is at risk and you have to log in to the exchange as soon as possible (the goal of the attack is to get login information) or enter the password cluster (the goal of the attack is to steal your property). The attackers try to create pressure and think that you want to protect your property. You should check the official website or account on the X platform. It is necessary to have all the necessary information if something is uncomfortable. It will always be doubtful if someone contacts you with a request to reveal sensitive information and no reliable information on social networks. Remember that in any case. you never get a password (seed) for a third party or write it on a website. It is always a scam. The password cluster is a secret secret that you and no one else knows. because it is the key to opening your digital property. If you provide login information for a fake website. the attacker will immediately try to use them and steal your money. Never rely on login information and password but always use two factors authentication (2FA). If you promptly realize the attack. change the password immediately and contact the support department (however. they may not respond quickly enough). Dont be greedy and dont believe that someone will give you something free. That is not the way the world operates. If something is too attractive or too unbelievable. it is almost certainly a scam. Remember that the token can be created very cheap. Scammers easily present a project that seems to change the world and you can get rich from it if you buy tokens in the previous sale. Remember the ICO fever at the end of 2017. Most of the projects have disappeared. leaving only valuable tokens. Some groups disappeared right after the sale of tokens and did not even try to pretend that they were doing something. Sometimes tokens may have the same code as the existing code. Always care about how to distinguish real tokens from fake tokens. If someone provides you with BTC for only half of the current value.',\n",
       " ' it is fake tokens. This can also be applied to NFT. If you are interested in a series. make sure you are buying original goods. not fake goods. unlike the Internet. allows you to distinguish genuine and fake goods. you need to know how to do it. such as to be able to find the money cast policy ID. Doubt. restrain the steps you want to do. do not follow your emotions and dont be greedy. Make sure you understand the technologies you use. including DEFI service. Do not be afraid to learn new things and always pay attention to the new tricks that scammers have thought of. It is not easy to protect your digital assets. With the introduction of AI technology. the scammers have a new weapon they will use. It will be easy to write text in any language. imitate the voice or even create a video in which your partner will ask you to send money quickly because they lose their wallets and cannot go home. The fight against fraud will never end and unfortunately. you cannot ignore this reality. In the video Midnight Special. Charles Hoskinson described the role of Cardano in the context of Midnight and partner chains. Midnight has been mentioned many times. but the explanation revolves around the ability to interact. super node. a general set of rules. What is being built is huge. It must be added that it will probably take many years to get such things. This article is based on our understanding of Charles video and may not be entirely accurate. The biggest tangible achievement of Cardano ecosystem is the Cardano Payment and Property (Cardano Asset Settlement and Settlement Layer (CASL). It is the original design class called Cardano settlement class (Cardano Settlement Layer - CSL). CaSl includes Ouroboros POS. Eutxo model. Cardano-original asset (CNA). Plutus in-chain (on-chain part of the application). liquidity Stake. Multiple authorities. on-chain administration. Babel fees (not yet deployed). CaSL will be improved over time. The EUTXO model will be improved. a new standard for security tokens is being developed. Plutus platform will be upgraded and input endorser will improve expansion. This is a pure technology view. economic and social aspects are also very important. because Pool (SPO) operators and investors play an important role to succeed. 1200 pool operations and 1. 3 million Stake people are a solid basis for high decentralization. CASL must be seen not only in the context of technology but also in a decentralized context. you can see something behind Cardanos success. Charles clearly mentioned that leaving this is meaningless. It is better to take advantage of it. It is important to note that in addition to decentralization. Pool operators also provide computer resources for Cardano network. Computing and decentralized resources cannot be exported to other ecosystems. What will happen if you can provide this service as a service for other chains?. Pool operators will have a new source of revenue. and decentralized and security of the whole industry will increase.',\n",
       " ' If it is possible to connect chains seamlessly (interactive ability). more combined and effective services can be built. Charles presented an ambitious plan to achieve this great goal. Cardano Partnerchain infrastructure (CPF) has been discussed at Summit Cardano. This infrastructure will make it easier to build new blockchain. And they can be Cardanos partner series. The basic idea is that CaSL will be surrounded by many service layers (partner chains). CaSL will be a place to maintain a high decentralization. very good scale and where the tokens will exist. The service will be used by CaSL. If the property in the real world is required. CaSL will be the place to create them. Services (partners) will use tokens from CaSL. the partner chain may allow their custom token casting. For cases of using privacy requirements. blockchain is required with protective data (Midnight). The partner chain can be built to focus on specific use cases. It can be decentralized storage. AI service. Oracles. KYC service. security services (such as Midnight). DEX or even centralized service (or decentralized). it is possible to connect not only existing blockchains but also old systems that want to connect more closely to the blockchain. The partners will have their own consensus mechanism. separate tokens. separate management. they will be independent chains that can ensure their security. it is possible to enhance security by borrowing a part from CaSL. which is basically from the Cardano infrastructure (SPO). Security from Cardano can be borrowed through SPOs Quorum sampling. Spo can run super node and can keep a part of the partner series. The partner series will have a class that can be described as a general rule. The partner series will be able to contact Cardano and with each other. How to connect Cardano to Bitcoin and Ethereum? Need to arrange for other ecosystem developers to easily connect to Cardano. A service layer must be created to interact. Developers must easily use a service. Thanks to the homogeneity on a platform. the connection will be done easily and quickly. For example: With this connection. Bitcoin can use DEX from the Cardano ecosystem. bridges that do not need trustless will be created to use recursive proving technology. Consistent evidence provides high levels of assurance for supported chains. Consistent evidence using Zero-Knowledge code. This technology can be used to increase interaction in blockchain because it allows effectively verifying transactions and status on different blockchain networks. a blockchain can provide recursive evidence of its state. which can then be verified by another blockchain. allowing non -reliable interactive interactions. A decentralized service often needs an infrastructure for its operation. this infrastructure can be decentralized more or less. The base layer (CaSL) must be maintained decentralized. but the service may be less centralized. the service will be decentralized (the right to self -management of property will be maintained). A decentralized infrastructure is something completely different from Blockchain. The infrastructure must have a predictable fee. the size of the resources as required. the SLA (Service Level Agreement).',\n",
       " ' Blockchain Cardano is basically a settlement layer (Settlement Layer) with a light programming layer (Plutus). What is super node?. It is the ability to module and contain parts of infrastructure that SPO can run. The partner series will comply with a common standard to be packed in containers (service settings packages). SPO will be able to decide which service (partner series) they want to support and operate on their node. With just one click. they can download the container containing the service and run it. The goal is to make the lighter containers possible. Mithril will be used to create light (or light) nodes of the partner series. Spo does not need to run the full node of all partners. but they can still confirm the blocks reliably. Spo can run node with cheap costs but still reliable and safe. Effective will ensure higher revenue. The concept of super node is an existing technology. Charles mentioned that the group was inspired by Hyperledgers Firefly and it was a good reference. you can see the concept of super node in Cardano ecosystem. SPO (part of the CaSL class) can run multiple light workplace apps of the partner chain (according to their choice) in the form that is contained on their super node. Stakers will see which partner series is run by SPO. Stake people can choose SPO depending on the partner series they support. The IOG group began to build Cardano partnership infrastructure by taking advantage of (possibly branching) Paritys Substrate. Substrate is a blockchain software development tool used by developers to create Parachains to create the Polkadot network. Substrate is SDK that developers can build any blockchain type not necessarily for the Polkadot ecosystem. Hoskinson said that the substrate is the starting point and a lot of changes and amendments have been made to make the framework meet the requirements of the Cardano ecosystem. Many Parity developers have previously been working on it. This may be related to Parity Technologies forced to dismiss 30% of its employees (about 100). In the context of Midnight. Charles talked about the double token model. There must be two tokens. One type will be confidential and exist on Midnight. The second copper will be cast on Cardano. The popular crypto coins now try to accomplish two uncomfortable goals at the same time. The service layer needs a moderate token. which can predict the service fee. That token is said to be a stable utility token. Crypto is also considered an investment. People expect them to increase in the future. The price of growth token is considered to reflect the success of the project. They also serve the decentralized network and administration. in a context. it is necessary to have a stability token. but in another context. tokens need high fluctuations. The goal of the IOG group is to build a system that meets both requirements. more information has not been revealed because the details are still being processed. In terms of positive. there will be a relatively strong connection between Cardano and Midnight.',\n",
       " ' Midnight administration (hope) should be based on tokens that will exist on Cardano. We will see. It must be easy for users. Users apply service payment (ADA or. for example: by Midnight token) and the fee will be automatically allocated to all those who have provided a part of the service. maybe an application on Ethereum (written in solidity) will use a series of partners to store data and KYC and these services may need Cardano (CaSL). part of ETH may be converted to ADA to pay for spo operating storage infrastructure and KYC (through the babel fee fee). Developers in the Cardano ecosystem must build a part-chain part next to the on-chain part of the application. They may consider creating a new series of partners instead of off-chain. The series of partners can provide services to application developers. DEX on Cardano for original assets (ADA and Token) can use KYC services provided by Midnight. A KYC trading floor can be created for self -management. Combined services will appear. this is a better situation than having complete centralized exchanges (CEX) or not only decentralized (with limited options to comply with the regulations). Through partners. developers from all ecosystems. will have access to many different services. Through the connection. you can not only use the services provided by the partner series but also CaSL. If successfully deployed. Cardano can be said to become the center of the blockchain industry. this is a very bold statement and may not be sure to happen. We hope that in the coming years. we will watch the battle between the dominant chains to become a ruling settlement. We dont think it will be Bitcoin because it has no good concept of tokens in the first class. Theoretically it can be Ethereum if it has better scale. The community should pay special attention to decentralization and administration. we must realize that making decisions is not due to reason but greed. What the IOG group is building is huge and must be said to be very ambitious. I even dare to say that it may be greater than Cardano (although Cardano may still be the center of everything - become a reliable anchor). we do not know when the new infrastructure will be available for developers. After the infrastructure is available. it may take a few more years for the first services to be created. What Charles is saying is reasonable. It is a good direction because it will allow the right to maintain the right to manage property and build services on Blockchain by using infrastructure more or less decentralized (if necessary) and supporting interactivity. See more videos of Charles Hoskinson. Midnight Special (voiced by the fimi group).November 21. What does it mean and how is it different from Bitcoin? Bitcoin is mainly considered an invariant monetary system. Cardano is a social and financial operating system. Bitcoin is simple and has immutable orientation. Cardano is a complex technology that needs to be developed. This article will explain to new people what the smart contract foundation allows people to do more than Bitcoin.',\n",
       " ' The basic function of blockchain is a monetary policy to cast money according to fixed rules and the ability to transfer money between users. Blockchain allows people to own and send money without intermediaries. these functions are the same for most blockchains. The difference is usually only in the number of coins issued. the rule of the indigenous casting rate. Bitcoin will have a maximum of 21 million VND BTC. Cardano will have a maximum of 45 billion ADA. At least that is how it is determined in protocol rules. The second clear difference is the qualities related to blockchains money transfer ability. Users are interested in the money that can be transferred quickly and for how the fee is as well as how long it takes to complete the transaction (recorded forever forever inverted in the blockchain). Blockchains expansion and clogged network frequency. It can be said that the two basic functions of any blockchain are monetary policy and trading network. If Alice uses Bitcoin. she can send BTC to Bob. Alice paid the transaction fee of about $ 30. It can take up to 10 minutes for a transaction to be inserted into a new block. A transaction can be considered to be completed within an hour (3-6 blocks). she can send ADA. The fee will be about $ 0. 07. The transaction is put into the block for 20 seconds. The transaction can be considered to be completed within 2 to 10 minutes (users are almost absolutely absolutely after 25 blocks. but usually just wait 5 blocks is sufficient). this platform usually has two basic functions. They are casting custom tokens and programming capabilities (smart contracts). any user in the world can cast their tokens. Users have the right to identify any monetary policy. including the option of burning tokens. Cardano users can not only send ADA to each other but also can send all the cast tokens. The publisher is responsible for the meaning of token. The market determines their value. Cardano protocol processes all tokens like ADA. This means that Cardano works with tokens equally at the ledger level and their transfer rules. Ada and Token have the same security and decentralization. Token Cardano can say against censorship like ADA. The encryption of property in the real world is often mentioned. these platforms are ahead of the management agencies. the most successful asset token so far is the US dollar. Coding dollars are an essential part of DEFI. but also a widely used property in developing countries with unstable Fiat currencies. A major feature of this platform is to allow third -party developers to deploy their source code (smart contract). which is the application. The application runs automatically and becomes part of the ecosystem. All users have access to the application. Applications can be considered as an extension of the basic protocol. The IOG group is responsible for the cardano protocol and its function. The protocol can only be transferred to ADA and tokens unconditionally.',\n",
       " ' Applications allow to work with a conditional value. The value is only transferred if it meets a predetermined condition. The application can act as a smart participant and an independent asset supervisor during the interaction between Alice and BOB. If Alice and Bob do not know each other or do not trust each other. they often need to find a reliable third party that both believe. This tends to be complicated and expensive if Alice and Bob come from different continents and speak different languages. the natural blockchain is everywhere and is considered the reliable layer of the Internet. The expansion of its function so that the basic financial activities are reasonable. If Alice and Bob want to exchange two digital tokens with each other. such as BTC packed to get coded dollars. the cardano platform will allow them to do so. The platform must have an execution tool that can be said to execute the program provided by a third party. To write such a program. the platform must provide developers with some programming languages. documents and a range of tools to support development. The cardano platform can execute Plutus instructions that developers can write. such as in Plutus or Aiken language. The application can work with ADA as well as all cast tokens. Cardano protocol and some of its main features. such as monetary policy. are almost unmistakable. The community will have to agree with the change. ADAs monetary policy is basically unchanged. The IOG group is currently responsible for its protocol and function. This is different from tokens and applications and it is important to understand the difference. The token was released by a third party independent of the IOG group. The same thing is applied to the deployment of applications. The IOG group has no control or responsibility for a third party code or cast token. Bitcoin is very limited in what it allows third party. The Bitcoin command allows you to transfer BTC to Lightning Network and vice versa. more complex functions are difficult to perform. Smart contract platform allows for easy creating dex. loan platform. and mortgage. Third -party groups are responsible for the quality of the application. They do not need to comply with the rigorous development standards like the IOG group. There may be a serious hole in their code. If an application is attacked. it doesnt necessarily mean that there is a hole on the protocol side or the platform. It is most likely an application issue. The IOG groups effort is to provide a protocol and the platform so that it is possible to write reliable and (official) applications to verify their functions. There may be significant differences between the platforms on this issue. Users need to distinguish when they are using the protocol and when they are using third -party applications. A protocol can be considered as the safest code and tested over time. Applications can only have this status after a while when they operate without problems. The task of Cardano and Bitcoin projects is basically different.',\n",
       " ' Although Bitcoin can be perceived mainly through BTC. considered a scarce digital product. Cardanos success is mainly in function. The principal is inseparable from the protocol. the mission of the project identifies functional requirements. This platform must develop like any other programming platform from the traditional world. developers have a new function. more efficient. expandable. Will increase. Smart contract platform. cannot continue rigid. the ability to innovate and improve is an indispensable part of the existence of the platform. BTC is a token for Hodl. No one expects Bitcoin will become the most expanded protocol or Bitcoin will become a smart contract platform. The main characteristic of Bitcoin is that the security and decentralization (tend to decrease). Although these are extremely important features for users. they are not directly related to direct interaction with the protocol. It can even be claimed that Bitcoin can be successful. although most of the BTC will be kept by the monitoring method. A significant part of the community thinks that Bitcoin has been completed and does not need to make significant changes in the base class. Changes can take place on other layers. Money cannot be deposited quickly and cheap will not have the opportunity to succeed. so technology progress is necessarily continued in the case of Bitcoin. it is not necessary to be in the first class. one can say that BTC is expected to replace money while the smart contract platform is expected to replace the bank. The question is which is more realistic. from the functional point of view. the second goal is much more complex. Smart contracts building groups face many technology challenges because their goals are to build an alternative financial system. it must be able to say regenerating current banking services at the same time effective. expandable and most importantly maintain a high level of decentralization. I believe that money is inseparable from financial services. Lending money is an unforgettable concept or stopping. We can ask what the future will be like about this. Does traditional banks keep BTC of everyone and even lend interest? Or can you do the same in a better manner?. Is BTC stable enough to suit loans or will need to create decentralized stablecoins will use scarce digital assets? Even this is unpredictable. The organizers strive to dominate. especially from the narrative point of view. while the smart contract platforms strive to dominate technology. For platforms. success will be determined by the direct network effect and the application of the business. The platforms must develop technologically. in a decentralized context. which means the effort to govern On-chain. This is another challenge that needs to be overcome. The community must say the right decision about the future development of the platform. The platform allows creating a competitive environment that can be similar to startups in many ways. There is continuous development and innovation when third parties try to find some types of competitive advantages. Their efforts depend a lot on the ability of the protocol and the basic platform.',\n",
       " ' forcing the platform groups to constantly improve and innovate. The platform must be attractive to developers. They must create attractive applications for users. This cycle tends to repeat. Users can only use the basic functions of the platform. the transaction network to transfer value. if they want to do more with decentralized value. they must use third -party applications. User activities increase the economic and social value of the platform naturally. The application of the platforms will take place mainly through utilities. Blockchain network is basically a reliable class for the Internet. Better programming ability helps connect people with decentralized services easier and increase the ability to interrupt financial services. Banks do not have to worry about the scarce digital products if they only buy. sell or lend them. If decentralized banks can be built. they will become an alternative to traditional banks. This is something that banks have to worry about.November 17. Cardano Foundation started a annual survey to evaluate the status of Cardano developer ecosystem. Developers have been asked 30 questions. the second round of survey took place with the same question. See how developers answer questions about building on Cardano. you will only find some statistics that attract our attention. 389 developers answered questions. only 174. We cannot assess the cause of the downward decline. Maybe in the first year. developers need to comment more about the state of the ecosystem. It may also be due to the ongoing price market or developers are focusing more on their work and have everything they need. The server results show this. We do not think that the number of developers in the ecosystem in 2023 will be lower than 2022 based on the number of projects currently being implemented. According to the weekly development report given by the IOG group. third -party groups are working on more than 1.300 projects. In all the following images. you will see the results of 2022 on the left and 2023 on the right. If the photos below each other. 2022 will be at the top and 2023 at the bottom. A group of hobby developers and experts are building on Cardano. The number of experts seems to be increasing. the number of developers according to their preferences is still relatively large. When the cardano platform is completed. we expect more experts to participate when the more complex projects arise requires focusing on security. reliability and user interface. the open platform will always be attractive to developers with interests or beginners. Developers built on cardano are very experienced. Most of them have over 10 years of programming experience. This is a very positive trend. This may be one of the many reasons why the cardano platform has not occurred a serious hack. It will be interesting to check the composition of developers on other platforms for comparison. The results can show that the cardano platform is especially suitable for experts and newly developed development. Cardano Foundation assesses this result is necessary to think about training programs.',\n",
       " ' documents and support. a functional programming language. is considered one of the obstacles for potential Cardano developers when the platform launches. many developers in the ecosystem have little experience in functional programming. This changed in 2023 when the number of developers with this experience increased significantly. only 10 developers answered that they had more than 10 years of functional programming experience. there were 43 developers. an increase of more than 4 times. We find the fundamental change in the preferences of developers related to the selection of programming language to write the Plutus (authentication). It was Plutus in 2022. In the second place is Marlowe. Aiken won. pushing Haskell to second place. The community of developers tried to build their programming languages. this language surpassed Haskell and won the first position of the year. We consider this as the most positive information from the survey. It shows the power of the community and the desire to build on Cardano even when paying the price by creating a new programming language. It will also be very satisfied for the Aiken group. Only the first 5 are displayed in the picture. While in 2022. there were only 7 languages \\\\u200b\\\\u200bthat could write a verification set. in 2023 there were 10 languages. The new languages \\\\u200b\\\\u200bare Helios. Opshin and Scalus. Cardano Foundation asked what developers what they consider to be the most difficult point. the introduction and Haskell were mainly difficult. It can be said that in 2023. that was similar. It is the complexity of searching documents and Haskell. A certain change in a better way is noticeable. developers complained about the development of unreliable and bulky main components as well as lack of tools and libraries. this platform was still young. this was a problem that could be overcome (or significantly less). The good news is that the UTXO model. the division of applications into the on-chain and off-chain parts or the need to handle and are not considered a significant obstacle. Developers seem to understand the difference between development on Ethereum and Cardano. What is the largest asset of Cardano ecosystem? According to developers. this is an impressive community. This is true for both 2022 and 2023. For other reasons. developers cited core technology and focused on basic principles. many open source tools and libraries. training resources. Aiken ranked third. This shows that the developer community is very dedicated to this programming language. the survey shows that it is necessary to improve documents. Documents scattered. incomplete. incorrect and often outdated. This is a big obstacle for beginners as well as experienced developers. Good news is that the developers consider themselves to be a knowing of Cardano. Turns out the community is ready to answer questions on the forum and give each other advice. This is at least partially compensating for documents. The process of development on the blockchain platform has certain specific details that developers have to solve. Cardano is significantly different from other platforms. especially in the accounting model (UTXO model).',\n",
       " ' The development of Cardano must be started by researching and understanding certain principles. The cardano platform is still relatively young. It may take several years to launch a new platform including complete documents as well as all necessary tools and libraries. Hardver Alonzo. helping Cardano to speak for a smart contract. taking place at the end of 2021. This means this year this platform will celebrate its second birthday. A lot of time. effort and money have been invested to create this platform. There are a large number of developers built on it. The number of projects is increasing. A lot of things have been done in such a short time. Developers know how to develop on Cardano. The evidence is that the number of applications is relatively large and the TVL is increasing. I am sure that Cardano will affirm its solid position in the crypto industry in the next increase market and stay here for a long time. Blockchain network will act as a decentralized public infrastructure for everyone on the planet. Blockchain must be similar to the Internet. like any technology. requires the ability to change and develop. Mistakes in design must be repaired. Technology advances must be accepted and taken advantage of. the blockchain network is difficult to change because it requires the consent and coordination mechanism of stakeholders when changing. It is necessary to solve the long -term sustainable problem. The cardano protocol must become a public infrastructure without any focus on control. but at the same time. the protocol must develop to meet future needs. It is natural for people to try to gain control of technology if they can earn economic profits from it. Blockchain network is no exception. A decentralization may be an empty word if no mechanism allows it to come true. A decentralization can be observed and evaluated relatively well at the level of block production. We can count the number of nodes in the network. the number of block manufacturers. the number of owners and supply an expensive resource (Stake. the exploitation. People naturally try to get as much power as possible. they want to operate as many groups as possible (become operators of many groups) or hold as many ADA as possible. This is similar in Bitcoin ecosystem. You can observe the two dominant groups (one of China and one of the US) and the concentration of the hash ratio in large exploitation rooms. there is no ecosystem without power competition. The natural thing is that the power competition also takes place at the level of control of the source code of the protocols. for customers (dominating) or project management (administration). Project management includes tasks such as planning. scheduling. coordinating contributions and supervision of the projects general orientation. In the context of open source projects. this role is often implemented by a core collaborator or a project maintenance person. Specific details may vary depending on the scale of the project. the complexity and the participation of the community.',\n",
       " ' Even organizations (for profit) can manage the development of open source projects. For example: Android is an open source project. While Google maintains Android source code and full -time working staff to improve and add new features for Android. other companies and individuals also play an important role in Googles development. An example is even better than the Internet. The Internet is not owned by any single entity. The majority of Internet infrastructure is owned by a few large media companies. The responsibility of improving and deploying errors is a common effort. Technology. government and civil society all play a certain role. The Internet is mostly not controlled and self -adjusted. making adjustments extremely difficult. The Internet is a typical example of where the blockchain project management can go. there is a drawback. In both Android and Internet cases. the management structure is complicated and related to many different entities with different concerns and agenda. This leads to power competitions when different subjects seek to assert their influence and control over the projects direction. The competition for power is always present everywhere. Who is responsible for managing blockchain projects?. The IOG group (formerly IOHK) is an organization for Cardano construction profit according to the roadmap since 2014. Cardano is an open source project. Source code as well as research (nearly 200 articles) are published widely. The group raised funds to develop Cardano through the sale of ADA public. Bitcoin is also an open source project. Bitcoin Core workstation application. the most popular software workstation application. is maintained by a group of global developers. The development of Bitcoin is subsidized by individuals. organizations as well as VC funds. It is important to note that there is also a competition that is taking place in the crypto industry. It does not matter if it displays or hidden. It will not matter if it is publicly mentioned. It doesnt matter who says anything. The competition for power is natural and spread. Groups may have some (good) intentions that may be publicly declared. the management structure is often complicated and including good people and bad people. Pressure for group members may be internal or external. The benefits of each individual may vary. Administration can be considered similar to the production of blocks. It can be said that the more subjects and stakeholders are. Can not focus on administration up to 100%. Specific steps will always be the responsibility of a small group of people. it is possible to try to allocate the right to decide to the parties as much as possible. It is possible to separate the right to make decisions from the right to perform individual tasks or perform changes. It is even possible to limit external influences by making the protocol maintain itself. It may be an uncomfortable experience when most agreed that a specific problem needs to be solved but it cannot be unified for specific steps. The debate about the increase in the size of the Bitcoin block is the biggest manifestation of management in the history of the Blockchain industry.',\n",
       " ' The community is divided into two sides: small blockers and big blockers. Many debateers consider the debate is not about the size of the block but the change of Bitcoins rules is easy or difficult. That is the level that Satoshis tradition needs to be preserved. The battle of block size is a authorized issue. It is much related to the philosophy and management of Bitcoin as well as its specifications. It was the first public power struggle. The result of a block size is a compromise that appears in Segregated Witness (Segwit). a solution that helps to effectively increase block size by changing the storage and verification method of trading data. And the small blocking tools have won because most of the hash rates and the number of network nodes have joined their faction. The consensus mechanism has been shown to be very difficult to achieve and the last disagreements can be decided by stakeholders. It is clear that changing the protocol rules. even a simple parameter will (at least temporarily) solve the existing network problem. is very difficult. if not almost impossible. It opens new questions. Is the construction on infrastructure not adapting to new conditions?\\\\xa0Do users feel comfortable knowing that some problems may not be solved because it is difficult to achieve the majority of consensus mechanism?. We still have no answer to that. The developers activity has moved to Ethereum. The development of Bitcoin has almost stopped (with some exceptions like Lightning Network). There is a slow revival caused by Ordinals. Inscribes. BRC-20. BitVM. Bring. these innovations must be done without support (change) at the protocol level. Some members of the Bitcoin Core group even publicly opposed some innovations. When the Cardano projects platform is being posed. the group clearly sees that it is necessary to solve the topic of administration and the ability to achieve collective consensus mechanism. If there is a concentration of power. it will be difficult to change the ritual regulations. People who feel comfortable with the current situation can resist changes. they may try to force changes without the approval of the majority and have a relatively high level of certainty that they will succeed. Both are not correct from decentralized views. The decision on changing the protocol rules or keeping the current rules will be the result of a collective vote. It is necessary to make efforts for most stakeholders to actively participate in voting. One of the pillars of On-Chain Administration is the introduction of documents. official processes and technical readiness for voting. The roles in the system and their responsibilities need to be clearly described. The structural change may be proposed. It is necessary to clearly describe how the approval process takes place. Can change this process itself. CIP-1694 is the first step to introduce the official management. Not only is the document being prepared but also the technical ingredient - Sanchonetwork. While CIP-1694 describes administrative actions. Sanchonetwork will allow administrative actions. One of the other important pillars of On-Chain Administration is Project Treasury (Project Treasury).',\n",
       " ' maintain and make changes that require funding. The dependence on the VC fund is not optimal. It is a way that third parties can try to gain control of protocol rules by gaining control of each member of the group. A budget project will become independent of external funding and thus can be sustainable. There are more than 1. 4 billion ADA (~ 530 million USD) in the Cardano budget at the time of writing. According to the dollar. the value of the budget may increase as the social and financial importance of Cardano increases. Control of the budget project is one of the administrative actions that will be in the hands of Ada holders. One of the other administrative actions is to start up the inverse network upgrade or change the cardano protocol parameters. The project has a proposal to improve Cardano (CIP) in operation (similar to the BIP process in Bitcoin ecosystem). The CIP process is used to describe an existing problem and propose to change. Each CIP can be argued among experts at a technical level. Commission and Dreps. CIP process. project fund control and voting ability can be considered as an on-chain management facility that allows stakeholders to decide the future direction of the project. along with other units. will not have the right to direct the upgrade of funds and protocols. Voltaire was the last era in the Cardano route. The Byron era (platform). Shelley (decentralized) and Goguen (Smart Contract) have ended. although the subsequent developments are being conducted in the field of shares and smart contracts. The IOG group is studying and implementing the ability to expand (Basho period). Once the Era Voltaire ends. Cardano will be completely in the hands of the community. it is not known how the handover will be and whether it is associated with a specific day or event. I dare to say that in the case of Bitcoin. like many other projects. the same thing has never happened. Groups still have much influence on their protocols and development. many projects can be said to be higher than Cardano and stakeholders involved in voting. Long -term sustainability is associated with the ability to develop. repair errors in design and adapt to new conditions. it is mainly related to the ability to maintain a high decentralization level. If Blockchain technology wants to become a new backbone of the world (reliable class) similar to the Internet. it must keep the main characteristics as a basis for its existence. Mass production must be decentralized as possible. In it. Cardano is the champion. The next step is decentralized management. which will allow the protocol to develop sustainably long -term.November 14. Most blockchains use some forms of fees to calculate transaction fees. When many people want to use blockchain. The fee will become more expensive when the demand for possession of mass space increases. the transaction fee will not be predicted and may change. The fee will be heavily affected by the network congestion.',\n",
       " ' which is not ideal. Cardano does not use this commonly used charging mechanism. Transaction fee on Cardano is fixed and predictable. We will explain to you how to calculate the fee for transactions and plutus instructions. We will also explain how Cardano works when overloaded and improved according to the plan called a valuation by level. The processing of a transaction or executing a smart contract in a decentralized network is very expensive. many computers have to run around the world to provide resources to the network. The node is operating is not free. Those who operate nodes expect compensation from the network as a regular reward. Before a transaction was put into a block. it must be decentralized throughout the network. It consumes the calculation power of the nodes to verify the transaction. Transactions are temporarily stored in Mem-Pool (temporary memory). After being inserted into the block. it will be stored permanently in the Blockchain. This consumes disk space. With each newly added block. the size of the blockchain will increase. Blockchain is a service that users have to pay. There is no third party allowance for network activities and making money from user data or advertising. In all decentralized networks. there must be some mechanisms to return the rewards for block producers. User fee is the source of income for the network. The charge for a normal transaction is very simple. The calculation is based on two parameters and the scale of the transaction. The formula looks like this:. Transaction fee = A + B * SizeC (TX). A and B are the protocol parameters that can be adjusted. Size (TX) is a trading size in byte. Parameters A reflects fixed costs to handle any transaction. regardless of its size or complexity. This plays a protection role against DDOS attacks (refusing decentralized services). The parameter B reflects the change cost when processing a transaction. depending on its size. The bigger the transaction. the more resources need to store and handle it. The protocol parameters A and B are currently placed. 155381 ADA and 0. 000043946 ADA/BYTE. A regular transaction can be 200 -byte size. the calculation looks like this:. Fee = 0. 155381 + 0. 0087892 = 0. 164271 ADA. users always pay exactly 0. Never more or less. The calculation is always the same. If the trading size is 300 bytes. it will be more expensive. The fee will be 0. 1685648 ADA. Only the scale of the transaction affects the fee. In the context of the UTXO model. this means a trading may have many output UTXOs with many output UTXOs. The more UTXO. the greater the size of the byte. The most common transaction has one (or two) UTXO ends of two output UTXOs (one recipient + returns a part of the deposit amount to the sender). Remember that sending tokens and NFT or using super data will increase the size of the transaction and therefore will increase the fee. It is possible that parameters A or B will change in the future or the charging system will change completely.',\n",
       " ' The goal is for users to pay a reasonable fee for the service provided by a decentralized network. It is necessary to realize that the uncertainty is inserted into the fee system because of the fluctuations of tokens and the fee is paid. Although the fee is stable and decisive according to ADA value. they fluctuate according to the dollar value. That is not ideal. It will be most convenient for users if charging in dollar because this will bring the highest stability to the system. users must pay about $ 0. 07 for a regular transaction (0. 17 ADA). if ADAs market price increases 10 times in the market price. the fee will be 10 times higher. ie 0. 70 USD (still 0. If the transaction requires the Plutus command reality. the charge will depend on a number of factors. In addition to the size of the transaction in byte. the number of calculations (CPU) and the number of memory units must be taken into account during calculation. Trading with commands is usually significantly greater because of more data processing. Each CPU step represents 1 pico seconds to perform. Common instructions will consume less than 1.000 CPU units (1 millisecond). The number of memory units indicates the number of bytes that the distribution order set. The usual instructions will consume less than 1.000 memory units (1MB of memory generation). Note: For normal transactions. the number of CPU steps and the number of memory units is not taken into account during the fee. They are placed in 0. The plutus fee estimates can be used to calculate the command verification fee. The estimated tool can be used to charge for command transactions or complete DAPPS before or during development. Primitive Plutus activities are evaluated on reference architecture to offer costs for each original CPU unit and the basic memory it uses. They are divided into ratios based on the number of different primitive quantities that are used instructions and overall costs for the instructions calculated based on the current cost for each CPU and memory unit. plus the scale of the transaction. It includes the size of the instruction. plus any day the instructions need. In the following table. you will find some examples of instructions and charges calculated to verify them. The maximum cost may be available for a copier will be 2. The use of applications may require multiple volumes to authenticate so the total fee may be higher. Cardano network does not prioritize transactions. The transactions are made on the basis of who comes first to be served first. if the network reaches the maximum capacity. transactions will have to put the waiting list in Mem-Pool. Mem-Pool also has limited capacity. If the mem-pool is full. the network will apply the reverse pressure mechanism. the network does not accept the sent transactions. Users must try to return the transaction later. Users cannot pay additional money for their transactions to be processed earlier if the cardano network is clogged.',\n",
       " ' In Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. users can make a higher fee than the current level and therefore basically prioritize transactions. Divine manufacturers choose to trade on high fees. They try to maximize their profits so they choose the highest fee transactions. the market fee is a natural market mechanism to meet the increasing demand for block space. it makes the network unreliable and monopoly (like rich people. high fees). Users whose transactions are overlooked to wait for longer payment (hours or even a few days) or they have to pay more money for the transaction. for some cases of use. it is necessary to prioritize transactions. The IOG group plans to introduce the so -called level -based pricing (also known as the Tiered Pricing Mechanism). You can consider this mechanism as a highway with many lanes. Each lane will have different speeds and different fees. The right lane will be slow and the fee will be cheap while the left lane will be fast but expensive. There may be many lanes between left and right lane lanes. Users can decide which lane to go based on the speed they need to reach the destination and the amount they are willing to pay. The fee is collected in a virtual pot in an era and is distributed through a stake mechanism between transitions between era. 3% of ADA from the reserve will be added to virtual jars. In virtual jar. there is a fee with reserve. 20% of ADA from virtual jars are included in the project budget. The rest is used to stake reward (see more). Blockchain network can handle a large number of cheap transactions. making it comprehensive and useful. Or it can handle a small number of very expensive transactions. making it exclusive and unable to use. the network may have the same fee. It will be ideal if the network is good because there is no need for a fee and all users are satisfied. Cardano has a fixed fee and can be predicted by ADA value and can be said that it treats user fairness. it still lacks priority mechanism. If the network is overloaded. it is impossible to prioritize transactions. which must be resolved according to the specific date and time in the context of financial services. With the market price is approaching. it will be very good if the application of fees by each level.November 10. Cardano has a reserve from which the new ADA tokens are released in each epoch circulation. Money from the reserve. along with the transaction fee. is used to stake the reward and fill the projects budget. This article will focus on the monetary policy of the protocol and the reward mechanism to help the network operate. Monetary policy refers to the protocol rules that govern the creation. distribution and management of ADA in Cardano. It includes aspects such as the total ADA supply. the speed of issuing new money from the reserve warehouse. filling the project budget. collecting charges and stake reward distribution mechanisms.',\n",
       " ' Cardanos monetary policy is aimed at keeping the protocol for a long time. ensuring its decentralization and security. The two main issues are solved: The need to award rewards to the network operators (Pool operators. Stake rewards) and the filling of funds (Catalyst. research and development of protocols). Everyone needs economic encouragement to maintain the network. The protocol regularly returns the reward. called the Stake reward. every 5 days between the conversion between Epochs. In the process of switching between Epochs. the protocol will take a new snapshot to capture the shares of the pool (block manufacturers) including ADA authorized to them. The state distribution status is taken by snapshot used in epoch. This affects the random voting of slots. who have the opportunity to create new blocks (and thus receive rewards for themselves and Stake people). In this epoch. the distribution of shares changes. Snapshot will be a fixed state for a period of time. The transformation between epoch is the time when the state of monetary policy changes. The number of ADA in circulation increases. the supply of circulation increases. because the Cardano protocol returns the Stake reward. the project budget has also been filled. Stake rewards for authorized (Stake) and Spos (SPOs) come from two sources: transaction fees and additional ADA. A certain percentage of the bonus amount is sent to the budget and the rest is used as an Epoch reward. We will talk about this more detail later. Cardanos future improvements will be greatly influenced by its community. which should be encouraged through the reward to participate in Cardanos development. ADA from the project budget will be used for this. The stakeholders will gain control of the Cardano budget in the Voltaire era. Cardano has a reserve source that is gradually exhausted and someday it will be completely exhausted. Cardano will have a stable income through transaction fees. The cost of protocols is a stake reward and activities sponsored by the project fund. Cardanos Genesis block was created on September 23. 2017. Cardano has a limited number of ADA. Only 45. It was decided that Cardano would not have inflation forever. When all ADA tokens from reserves are released in circulation. no new token will be created. ADA is scarce in digital because their quantity is limited. Monetary policy is largely determined by the original ADA distribution. The initial distribution of ADA took place in Asia in four stages from October 2015 to the beginning of January 2017. This distribution. basically a sales event before launch. is the first event in the Crypto industry to set out the principles of your customer and the inspection process has been implemented. Perform during the distribution process. It is worth mentioning that the VC funds have deliberately eliminated from the public offering. During the public sale. 57. 6% of ADA were sold. Cardano Foundation received 1. 4%. IOG 5. 5% and Emurgo 4. 6% ADA. 9% of ADA was put into Cardano reserves. That is 13.888.022.853 (about 14 billion) dong ADA.',\n",
       " ' Cardano has a fair distribution when you find that 88. 5% of the supply includes semi -public and reserve. 3 founding units combined only occupy 11. 5% of the supply. Cardano reserves are gradually exhausting between Epoch conversion. At the time of writing (November 2023). about VND 8. 66 billion ADA reserved. the so -called virtual jar is filled with ada each Epoch. A virtual jar has two streams of income and two spending streams. The income includes the issuance of new money and all the fees that the protocol earns in that epoch. Costs are Stake rewards and project funds. The mechanism is controlled by protocol parameters. New money issuance speed is determined by parameter ρ. It is placed into 0. Each epoch. 3% of ADA is taken from the reserve and put into virtual jar. The collected amount of transaction fee may vary depending on each epoch. The more Cardano network users. the more transaction fees. The T parameter determines the % of the virtual money will be included in the budget and the remaining amount for the prize stake. The T parameter is placed in 20%. And 80% will be left for Stake rewards. you can see the virtual jar filled with ada (blue arrow) and then use tokens (red arrow) to stake rewards and full budget. the supply of circulation is stable. It includes tokens held by stakeholders and tokens in the budget. In the process of conversion between epochs. ADA is being transferred from reserves to circulation. The number of coins in the budget will increase and all Stake (including SPO) will receive Stake rewards. Note that the fee will only be the amount of ada in circulation and does not affect the issuance of new money. The circulation supply does not always increase the exact 0. 3% of the ADA from each Epoch. There are some stake rewards that are not fully paid but depending on the performance of the pool. some conditions to achieve Stake bonus may not be met. so a significant part of ADA is returned to the reserve fund. Cardano assesses the performance of the pools (missed blocks. slot battle. the allocation of stake money. the saturation of the pools. the number of pools and some other things and adjusting the reward scale accordingly. this is indicated by the symbol η. There is something called the potential maximum reward ratio that Cardano can pay for each epoch for block production. If you do not meet certain conditions. only a part of the bonus will be paid. a part of Stake bonus has been received (it increases the supply of circulation) and partly not received (it is returned to the reserve fund). The reserve is falling slower than the initial prediction of the development group. By mid -2023. the group expected to have about 7 billion ADA reserves. The fact is about 9 billion ADA in the reserve. you can see the transition between the two epoch. The reward has no recipient to be missed to simplify.',\n",
       " ' Note that there is a reserve and a budget in the system. The protocol takes ADA from the same reserve and transfers them into the same budget. the number of Stake and Spo people enjoying the Stake reward may vary for each epoch. you can see how Cardano divides the reward (stake rewards have been confirmed) between SPO and Stake. In the process of calculating the reward. the Cardano protocol conducts this way (simplified). the reward for the pools is calculated. It is based on the shares and performance of the pool in that epoch. Pools shares (normal) include the operators ADA and all Stake people. The protocol first calculates the reward for the Pool operator and then the Stake. The operator places their rewards through two parameters to determine the fixed reward and the change (deposit). After deducting the reward for the Pool operator. the protocol will take the remaining reward and calculate the reward for the Stake. There is less ada copper in the reserve after each epoch. The reserves will gradually exhausted. You may wonder what will happen to the reward stake in a few more years when the reserve is significantly lower than today. Stake rewards will depend more on the collected transaction fee. they only account for a small part of the total bonus paid. the more reserves are shallow. the more you need to pay the user. If Cardano or any other blockchain wants to exist for a long time. it must be profitable. there must be enough income to pay for operation. security and maintenance. This will be a big challenge.November 8. After the Summit Cardano and the interview with Eran Barak. CEO of the Midnight project. we have a little more clear idea about what Midnight will be like for Cardano. we will try to answer the question of what a partner (partner chain) means. There is still lack of information. so our opinion may not be accurate. In the legendary document Why Cardano now wrote that the calculation of value should be separated from the story behind the reason why the value is moved. This basically means a value of computation (computation). The two layers were created. The first class of Cardano settlement class (CSL). This is a ledger. This class is responsible for calculating (sending and recording value). The Cardano ledger supports some programming languages \\\\u200b\\\\u200band can operate with the original assets created by users. The second layer is Cardano calculation class (CCl). This class aims to isolate CSL from the burden and complexity related to the performance of smart contracts and allow such many layers to exist. All CCL has the same ledger. CSL. One of the goals of the settlement class is good scale expansion and can serve all CCLs that can handle parallel calculations. Charles Hoskinson recalled this design at Summit Cardano. Cardano payment layer has been renamed the payment class and Cardano (CaSL). The new name of CSL is Cardano service class. This replaces CCL (Cardano calculation class).',\n",
       " ' It is important to note that Charles talked about the importance of interoperability and new framework to build blockchain. The new frame will be called Cardano Partnerchain Framework (CPF). He also refers to the study of the use of multi -consensus mechanisms (such as POW and POS) in a system called Minotaur. He also mentioned Parity Stack to build Blockchain called Substrate. CPF (in the presentation of Charles. they are talking about a framework. not a specific series of partners) is said to use Minotaur technology. the multi -resource consensus mechanism. I understand that the new frame (CPF) uses substrate and minotaur. CSL is said to have a consensus mechanism and their ledger. In the original cardano design. CCL has no consensus and ledger. They are calculations. which means it is an off-chain part of smart contracts (applications). The off-chain logic of applications cannot work without the on-chain. which is basically no solving class (CSL). you can see how the applications on Cardano are currently active. This will change with the new design that Charles has introduced. CSL (Cardano Service Class) will basically be a series of partners. The partner series will have a separate ledger and consensus mechanism. which means that they do not need Cardano to exist. Midnight is a series of partners or new version of Cardano service class. Charles mentioned that existing SPOs. the CSL maintenance (in the future) can provide security for partners. For this. they will be rewarded with the token of the partner series. some potential relationships between Cardano and Midnight have been suggested. Midnight is the fourth generation blockchain focusing on privacy. Midnight will have a consensus mechanism and ledger. It is being built from the beginning. According to CEO Eran Barak. Midnight will be independent of Cardano. The partner series is not a layer solution 2. Cardano is a strategic partner because it has a large number of spo that can be used to start Midnight. This allows Midnight to achieve high decentralization very quickly. Third -party developers can create new use cases through the use of both chains. They will be encouraged financially to do so.000 pools are interested in accessing the development network. it did not come to everyone. Midnight was introduced in Summit as the first series of partners. To understand what Cardano partner series is. it is necessary to know what Paritys basis is. This will also help you understand exactly what a partner series may be. Substrate is the SDK that you can use to build Parachain and Polkadot as a means of security chains and allows them to communicate with each other. Although the substrate can be used to build any blockchain. not only the Parachain Polkadot. the connection with Polkadot brings countless benefits. including integrated security and the ability to interact between chains. Although the substrate and polkadot have a synergistic effect. they do not depend on each other. The chain is made of substrate without having to connect to Polkadot (or Kusama). The substrate -based chain may exist as a single chain on the basis of independence.',\n",
       " ' Although Parachain is part of the Polkadot network and benefits from its security and interaction features. they operate independently and have its own consensus mechanism. Relay Chain in Polkadot plays an important role in coordinating interactions between different parachains and verifying transactions related to communication between different parachains. in that sense. Parachains relies on relay chain for certain functions. Substrate is only mentioned in the context of the newly built framework. not in the context of Midnight. it has not been confirmed that the team uses Substrate to build Midnight. The partner series can be an independent. independent chain with another relay. Midnight will most likely be like that. Charles said at Summit that the partner chain can borrow security from other chains and it may be CaSL or other chains. this only means that Cardano Spo will be used leverage or whether there are some forms of payment at the Cardano ledger (CASL) or not yet unknown at this time. But it is almost certainly not necessary for Midnight. Charles talked about interaction but did not indicate any mechanism that would be used to connect the partner chain (CSL). It will only through CaSL or a new class (relay chain) will be created similar to what the polkadot ecosystem has? That is not known at this time. The current Cardano consensus mechanism is not ready to serve as a relay chain because it has a long time. connecting partners is very important to ensure interaction. To connect string (or applications). it is necessary to use a number of common standards or frameworks. Polkadot has done this. In the case of CPF. it is not clear how it will work and whether the IOG group will work with it. At Summit. Charles described and painted what you see in the picture. The broken lines show that the partner series does not depend on any other series. for interactive purposes. some relationships exist. The partner series will have their consensus mechanism. This means that they also have to have their own monetary policy and token system. In the case of Midnight. we do not know the details. All we know will have 2 tokens. Dust will be a protected token. There will be a second token on a public ledger with Dust. Midnight may focus on business and SLA. I hope it will not have a chain administration like the current shape for Cardano. I do not consider Midnight as a series of people built for humans but a commercial chain of IOG. Some present that Midnight. as the fourth -generation blockchain for businesses. has a higher growth potential than Cardano. Regarding the users operation. it is clear that Midnight may be a competitor to other chains. like every other project in the Blockchain industry. is struggling for developers. users and liquidity. I will be happy to make mistakes and maybe some details will be revealed to convince me that Midnight will be Cardanos partner in the common sense of prosperity.',\n",
       " ' IOG is an organization for profit and obviously they want to use many years of research not only for Cardanos benefit but also for the benefit of the organization. some other companies are not established. but only for open source documents and use them to build Midnight. People from IOG know very well why businesses have not used the Blockchain network on a large scale. With Midnight. they will meet the legal requirements and other requirements that existing projects have a public ledger and fluctuating token can not meet. it is a pity that Cardano does not have a private ledger or it will not use other private smart contracts and other technological progress in the field of Zero-Knowledge coding that IOG (and other groups in the field of crypto) have achieved. Cardano will have the right to manage the chain and those holding ADA will hold the project. They will determine the future of Cardano. DAPPS developers should also implement the same approach. They can use both Cardano and Midnight and create new use cases based on this. It is not useful to make the conclusions that are definitely early because. as I mentioned in the introduction. there is still very little information. We see the opinions of people in the community to understand Midnight different from us. It will benefit the community if the IOG group exchange more about Midnight and the new framework to build Blockchain.November 7. The preparation for on-chain management not only takes place at the level of determining rules and processes via CIP-1694 but also in terms of technical. we will introduce Sancho network. You will find out what you can do on this network today. Sancho Netwest is the gateway for On-Chain Administration. it is still being developed so it runs as a test network on which the ADA tokens of the test network are used. The real ada from the main network is not used. Sanchonet is based on CIP-1694 documents to allow administrative actions. Anyone in the community can participate and participate in the development process of Sanchonet. You can become the owner of ADA (the owner of the ADA test). operate the Pool Stake (SPO) or the authorized representative (DREP). The owner of ADA may send administrative actions. They may authorize their shares to DREP the same way they decide which group will authorize ADA. The Drep role was first introduced in CIP-1694. Dreps acts as a representative of the community. They are spokesperson in the administration process. Dreps actively participate in voting on management activities and support for community interests. Similar to Pool. Dreps may have different voting rights depending on the level of shares authorized for them. Spo is mainly responsible for creating tests on the testing network. Like those who hold ADA. they can vote on administrative actions. In CIP-1694 document. the official Cardano Constitution and the Constitution Committee are described with Dreps. the role of a committee member has not been used in Sanchonet (as I know).',\n",
       " ' you can participate in Sanchonet development as a developer. This role is not described in CIP-1694. This is the help of the development of governance technology. this may be a good experience. Sanchnet is a technology component for developing and testing technologies that will later be used in On-Chain Administration. This ingredient will then be used on the main network as soon as all the necessary off-chain ingredients are distributed. CIP-1694 describes seven types of administrative actions:. The mission of Sanchonet is to encapsulate the administrative actions that the participants will need to perform in common use situations. I found a great description on Sanchnets official website. it was easy to understand and I like it:. Sanchos ability in realistic harmony with the noble ideals reflect the nature of Sanchonet. Like Sancho. Sanchonets mission is to develop a system -based system and are guided by visionary principles. The ultimate goal? To establish a platform in which every voice is meaningful. including comprehensive and pragmatic intelligence in governance. Sanchonet has a roadmap marking 6 important milestones. 4 important milestones have been implemented. The current state is described in the image below. You can register as Dreps on Sanchonet. The owner of ADA may authorize the selected Drep and they may vote. Can update the committee and withdraw ADA from the budget. The group is currently studying the possibility of changing the protocol parameters. The idea that one day these administrative activities will be in the hands of the community is very attractive and basically needed in a decentralized viewpoint. If you choose to collaborate on Sanchonet. please join IOG Discord. In #Start-Here. select Join the Sanchonet Community. If you want to register as a spo or drep. you need to run your test network node and can use the command line (CLI). You need to create a lock for Drep and Drep ID via cli. This allows you to create a registration certificate that then you sign and send to Sanchonet. There is currently no choice but to use the Cli (as I know). I consider this a barrier for those who are not technically gifted but there is something to contribute to the community. I think the interface will be improved in some later development stages. the highest priority of the group is to implement support for management activities. Community tools are also being prepared for management. Cexplorer will have a new tab for administration and you can use it for Sanchonet. The use of CLI is also necessary to authorize the ADA for the selected Drep. only NUFI Wallet has a plan to support management on Sanchonet. Let Cardano enter the voltaire era. documents and technical components must be prepared. Both are being implemented. Feel free to explore Sanchonet. All members of the community are welcome to actively participate in shaping the future of Cardano. At the Cardano Summit 2023 this week. the founder & CEO of IOG Charles Hoskinson sketched a new framework that will provide new ways for developers and the person to take advantage of Cardanos core power - and some interesting new Cardano technologies - to build their own optimized partners.',\n",
       " ' The partner series will revolutionize how to launch and operate new blockchain by combining modular blockchain technology with security. liquidity and reliability proven by Cardano. The partner series will achieve these benefits without being bound by any network or technology. Since the white book Why Cardano and the white table video - now viewed nearly two million times - the ability to interact and expansion is always the core of Cardanos mission. The partner series is the continuation of Cardanos initial vision. Cardano is designed with the separation between the Cardano settlement layer (CSL) from the Cardano calculation layer (CCl). The settlement layer has been shown to be strong and expanded. forming the final cross -chain settlement layer. With partners. networks will be able to say building their own calculations by taking advantage of the existing module and components. but still taking advantage of the settlement layer to solve on the chains. Blockchain focused on protecting IOG data recently. will be the first series of partners to implement this new framework. The presentation of Charles Hoskinson at the Cardano 2023 Summit is the peak of more than 4 years of research and development of scholars and engineers around the world. and also the extensive technical discovery and testing. IOG is based on the substrate stack of Parity Technologies. a proven open source module frame. as a basis. expanding it with a reliable integration with Cardano and contributing a set of substrate components that can be combined (called pallet) to unlock the potential of the partner series. IOG has long shared in common and respected the modular technology that the Substrate group has developed. An illustration. the babe protocol is based on Ouroboros Praos. confirming the common belief in basic research. Application of this module approach to Substrate will allow partners to deploy any consensus protocol. meeting the requirements of Minotaur to allow partners to take advantage of specific resources for their consensus mechanism. the substrate open source has a high supplement to the system of Cardano and consistent with our overall vision of a blockchain world that can interact. IOG is investing heavily in developing a new series of partners. using a team of researchers. engineers and developers around the world and the desire to pursue open source cooperation opportunities on Blockchain space. The partner series solves the main problems of existing modular blockchain solutions: interaction. token economy and locking capacity. With the partner chain. Cardano became the final payment layer and more. Security is provided by SPO of Cardano. while the MINOTAUR multi -resource -consensus protocol will allow the person to verify from other blockchain ecosystems. The babel fee will solve the token problems for new networks and allows SPOs to receive rewards with ADA. The bridges that do not need trust will connect the partners with Cardano and moreover to be able to say interactive is not risky. *The series of partners represents a new approach of interaction and blockchain network. provided by Cardano. Track IOG social channels to always update.',\n",
       " ' We will continue to share details when this framework is developed and further deployed.November 2. Some related reasons threaten the success of the Cardano project. Lets look at them and consider whether they can resolve it. We will focus on the issues:. Crypto is mainly speculative for most holders. More than 95% of Crypto owners hold crypto on centralized exchanges. Only a small percentage of people owning hardware wallets and positive awareness about property self -management. According to experts estimates. hardware wallets are owned by millions of users (at least tens of millions). This is also shown by the number of valuable addresses of different blockchain projects. Cardanos success is mainly based on user and Stake. Everyone must use Cardano. which means they have to use DEFI applications. they must have their own cardano wallet. they must not be afraid to manage their property themselves. Cardano should not be used from centralized trading floors. It is possible to argue that this is not only a problem for Cardano but also for the entire blockchain industry. It seems that people do not care about the main interests of decentralization and only speculate that there will be interest in it in the future. For Bitcoin. this is not a big problem because this is a project for Hodl (held). For the condition that the exchanges focus on honestly and managed (monitored) more closely. Bitcoin can succeed. Although everyone in the Bitcoin ecosystem is trying to call people to keep the BTC in their wallet. most communities expect Bitcoin ETFs approval by placing the finger on the sale button. this is a difficult problem to solve. Blockchain comes with a unique feature that people have not learned to use. The dependence on concentrated infrastructure is a risk. The collapse of FTX causes the value of the entire crypto market sharply. another collapse of the Binance trading floor will adversely affect the reputation of Blockchain. Cardano ecosystem has two options. Try to take over the user of other ecosystems and attract new users who have not used crypto. Both are complicated. People are mostly loyal to the foundation they have enriched. This is especially applicable to early accepting people. They are one of the most influential people in todays crypto field. some people are trying new platforms and is ready to move to another place or use multiple chains. Cardano needs to attract and retain these people. This can be done. attracting new people is difficult because most of them do not start using DEFI and buy crypto and only then start self -study. The road to Defi is long and has many obstacles on the way. Important partnership and the support of current businesses can help. We need more cooperative relationships such as the cooperation between IOG and the Ethiopian government. Not such a cooperative relationship for 3 years but many relationships each year. This is also a big challenge. People must have cardano on their mobile phones and use it. such as to pay by stablecoin or digital identification (DID).',\n",
       " ' This is the only way to apply DEFI in mass. There is a certain thing. Unless people start using their wallets more. the application of DEFI will be very difficult. It has not even happened in Bitcoin ecosystem. We cannot expect that thanks to Cardano or other smart contract platforms. people will start using it in large quantities. if the Crypto holding in a wallet of an economic or useful person will have the motivation to learn it. The yield in DEFI can be that motivation. The biggest obstacle to the higher cardano application is the absence of Stablecoin supported by USD in the ecosystem. We have Indigo. but we need something that people are not afraid to use. These are stablecoins supported in USD. I believe that Emurgo promised to launch a Stablecoin USDA in the first quarter of 2023. but this effort could hardly succeed due to legal barriers. Emurgo is still trying to start the project. but its been a long time since I heard any positive updated information. The Mehen project (USDM) is trying to fill the gap in the market. This project received funding from Catalyst Fund10 and promised to launch this year. at the end of 2023. The IOG group hired two senior experts. Sean Ford and David Markley to form a Stablecoin company. This is definitely a right step. but the question is how long we will take to see the first results from their efforts. I am sure this should have come sooner. Perhaps this is a reaction to the failure of USDA. I believe this step will succeed. I want the new group to try to negotiate with existing projects and receive USDT and USDC on Cardano. We will see if it is in their agenda. Cardano needs a stablecoin supported by USD before the next price increase market and that has started or will start next year (2024). I cannot imagine the success of DEFI on Cardano without Stablecoin. I am a big fan of the DJED project and I think the stablecoin is based on algorithms and are mortgaged beyond the level of currency. This type of project can use crypto easy to fluctuate and create stablecoins without having to trust the supervisor (bank). after the collapse of the Terra Luna project. people no longer believe in this type of stablecoin. I hope time will heal wounds. but I cant estimate when it will happen. Cardano is not the only project that needs more DEFI users. it is quite new with unique architecture. People have learned how to use applications in other ecosystems. especially the Ethereum application. but they are not always motivated to try something new. DEFIs development depends on the quantity and quality of applications. This is affected by the number of developers in the ecosystem. Cardano Foundation has recently conducted research related to developers. The results showed that developers could build on Cardano without big obstacles. That is positive. most developers plan to use Aiken instead of Haskell (however this is the second priority option).',\n",
       " ' Aiken is a community project that has achieved great attraction. According to the Defillama portal. there are 950 applications deployed in the Ethereum ecosystem. 650 applications on BSC. 500 on Arbitrum and Polygon. 350 on Avalanche and 110 on Solana. The number of applications is often correlated with TVL and the number of users. We only find 29 applications on Cardano (however. Defillama does not list all the applications that have been deployed for a number of reasons). Cardano at the same level as Algorand (29). Tron (26). Near (21). EOS (20) and Tezos (17). It can be said that Cardano has surpassed projects such as Waves (9). Ton (10). Bitcoin (10. but Bitcoin is not the foundation). Wanchain (8). Hedera (8). Zilliqa (5). About the number of applications. I dont think the number of applications is important. For example: Tron has a lower number of applications than Cardano. but TVL has the second highest number of applications after Ethereum. this is an exception. The positive thing for Cardano is that many applications are still being built and the groups are improving the applications that have been implemented. The IOG group registered about 1300 projects built on Cardano. If we only need to complete 10% of them. we will have about 200 applications on Cardano. Cardano maintains a reputation as an unprecedented foundation. This is a huge advantage from the actual perspective that the market has not evaluated. Hack will definitely occur at some point in the future. Some third -party groups may make serious mistakes and vulnerabilities that appear in smart contract codes and hackers exploiting that hole. It is important that some projects in the ecosystem have been operating for many years without any hack. DEX has to operate for a few years without any problems before making sure it will be a new Uniswap on Cardano. The same thing is applied to loan platforms. I believe we will see one day. I realize the development of applications positively and I think their number will increase. this is not necessarily guaranteed to have a new number of new users in the next price increase. The number of high applications. low fees. high reliability. high security. expansion ability is resolved. privacy and decentralized identification are all features that can attract users for a period of 5 to 10 years. Unpredictable quantity and whether Cardano is in the top 3 or not. Other projects are trying to do the same thing. Ethereum has the leading advantage among the platforms and that will be difficult to overcome. What can be fixed is the large number of layers 2 in the Ethereum ecosystem. some layers 2 basically can assert themselves and become dominated. base can be successful because Coinbase has a high user. I dare to say that Cardano is being built with a slightly higher goal than attracting the first fans of decentralization and DEFI. Cardano is built with high levels of careful carefulness. The first research approach and the official development method were used.',\n",
       " ' This approach takes time. from the market perspective. this is slow. Some people think that Cardano is late and there is no chance. It was too early to say this at this time. but the fact that people are using what is available. According to IOG. 150 projects have been implemented on Cardano (more than what Defillama declared) and nearly 80.000 token polisies were released. Cardano seems to have a great chance of success. Moreover because the main reception waves are right in front of our eyes (see the first part of the right to manage). Sometimes I think that the projects called the new Ethereum-Killer no longer have a chance because Ethereum will win through the second grade. They said it was too late for new smart contract platforms and this opportunity has existed in the recent price increasing market when Ethereum has a big problem of expansion. This may or may not be the case. Only time can answer. IOG has spent a lot of time making Cardano perfect. Cardano can say the stake is superior. significantly contributing to decentralization. it is a right step. because the blockchain industry has the opportunity to succeed through decentralization. not speculation. The fact is that most Crypto fans do not care much about decentralization. For them. the current utility is more important. ie DEFI. tokens cast or cheap global transmission network. Competition has an advantage in this. Layer2 has solved the problem of Ethereums low expansion. so this ecosystem will keep a significant part of users. I think Layer 1 like Ethereum still needs to expand significantly better when the wave of new users appears. Once again we will see the fees that are unreasonable for both Bitcoin and Ethereum because the network will be blocked. Cardano seems to be a more attractive platform. but only when it is better prepared for this wave. Currently not. If Cardano wants to succeed. it needs to expand its good scale. ideally next year. I dont think IOG can provide endoser input so quickly. Perhaps Hydra can help if groups use this solution and combine it into their application. The Sundaeswap group presented a prototype in which their DEX used Hydra. This may be a good direction for the next price increase. the second layer may be a bit difficult to use. They divide the user and capital into more separate units. It will be ideal if one. two or three layers 2 are reliable connected. There are many layers 2 competing with each other. the old disappears and the new appearance is not good at all. Users are forced to learn new things and constantly switch between them. Some of them may feel tired of it. Cardano has some advantages in that it uses the UTXO model. This makes it a significant different foundation compared to account -based model platforms and copying EVM. The question is whether this is a long -term advantage in parallel viewpoint. or a disadvantage due to the complexity of the development process from the perspective of developers.',\n",
       " ' There is no solid answer to this. I think it is an advantage. Developers have learned the UTXO model. continue to explore it and come up with new concepts. Applications like Axo Dex are being created. in groups. and cannot be created on an account -based model. We know from history that better technology is not certain to be the winner. This does not mean that Cardano with better technology will be better. the development process takes more time (although the IOG group has provided POS 2 years earlier than the Ethereum group) and it is difficult to evaluate whether it is an advantage or disadvantage in the context of the market in the long run. 10 years. If current projects have some problems. whether it is the ability to expand low. hacked or people are increasingly interested in decentralized quality. It could be a certain advantage for Cardano. But first. you cannot rely on that. second. Cardano must be ready to take the dominant position at the time. the market can attach importance to network effects (the number of users) more than the technology quality (this is largely subjective). Sometimes it is better to stay in quick solutions and put beta versions into direct operation. it is better to stake to build high quality technologies and then take over the competitor. Currently no one can predict how it will happen in the blockchain industry. Specific events can change everything quickly. I consider the IOG group. and therefore Cardano. the leader in the Blockchain industry. This is a achievement that attracts attention and is one of the reasons why Cardano has such a huge and loyal community. DEFI users are born from the community. there are still relatively few people in the context of other platforms and layers. It will need to offer some great applications or cases to attract new users. It would be helpful if you go ahead of the opponent in a certain field. Some hope may be Midnight. this will bring privacy to the Cardano ecosystem. Zero-Knowledge projects are also built elsewhere. I believe Cardano will find his user. A project has no chance to take over all users. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are unsuccessful. A competitive environment is healthy and lets be happy for that. People consider the blockchain industry as an investment opportunity rather than hope to change everything around us. As the number increases. it is considered to be successful and overshadow all the debate about important things such as decentralization. I hope there will be a reasonable debate about the future of the Blockchain industry. this may never happen because there will be not enough economic or social motivation for this. the biggest obstacle to cardano application is mostly lack of stablecoin supported in USD. this is a relatively easy problem and is being solved by IOG. We can also hope for the launch of USDM. Everything else is open and difficult to predict. I dare to say that no one can accurately predict the blockchain industry.',\n",
       " ' There are many efforts to manipulate through the media in space and the main motivation leading to the application of greed. The debate about the necessity of self -management is overshadowed by unnecessary topics and drama. On Cardanos POS (POS) protocol - Ouroboros - authorized and Spos (SPO) received a reward when they contributed to network security. Specifications of the cardano ledger outline the formulas to calculate these rewards. Remembering this and part of Cardano Foundations efforts towards the ability to restore the operations of the network. we have opened the source of independent rewards with the node. The project aims to achieve a means of implementation and confirm the calculation of independent rewards with a single deployment. It also seems to provide comprehensive documents related to the fund. reserves and Pool prizes of Cardano. As an open source archive under the MIT license. this initiative also enhances Cardano Foundations commitment towards the maturity of the open source and aims to attract the contribution from the general ecosystem. the calculation can also act as a training tool. such as regarding how the protocol parameter changes can affect the cash flow. it enhances transparency and improves the ability to recover. Blockchain Cardano offers some unique features. carefully studied. The important thing is that Ada Stake is always in the users wallet. The freelance entruster moves to another wallet at any time. Although this function has many benefits. it also poses challenges in the implementation of the reward calculation. This requires the use of Snapshot (the state -shaped picture) to calculate the reward. as stated in the ledger specification. This process starts by calculating new reserves. total rewards and budgets. the Pool reward was determined based on the total number of this reward. Pool rewards are used to calculate the reward of Stake Pool and Stake Pool operator. Due to Snapshot -based calculation requirements. the Stake account may occur may be registered after fast photography. the Stake account cannot receive a reward after the calculation is completed and need custom rules to handle those special situations. These rules are naturally popularized on the basis of the code because the calculation itself is allocated over time. The storage of Cardano books synthesizes most of the business logic along with related documents. You can find some additional ingredients necessary for this process in Node Cardano itself or in the Ouroboros network storage. The code is executed using a position -based schedule. which can make it difficult to read and follow people who are not familiar with the code facility. Although certain optimization has been given to improve calculation performance. these optimization can make the code more difficult to understand. The calculation of open source rewards to resolve these challenges while maintaining the inherent strong features of Cardano network. The Cardano ledger includes many common ADA flow defines at the end of each epoch. Each node will calculate the independent reward for each epoch in a way that disperses with all potential rewards and then is distributed based on the consensus mechanism.',\n",
       " ' no entity completes this calculation and no one can retain the reward. These ADA rewards are calculated from time to time and come from the interaction of two sources: transaction fees and currency expansion. The total number of rewards is then divided into two parts. The first part was put into the budget. while the second part created a reward for Pool Stake. the above reserves initially had about 14 billion ADA and gradually decreased after each epoch. another calculation calculates Stake Pool rewards. using Stake Pool parameters. combined with the clear performance of the pool. determining the individual Stake Pool reward. The results of the results formed the platform to calculate the reward for both the authorized and the operator. It is important that all these calculations depend on protocol parameters. The calculation of rewards is an integral part of the Cardano Blockchaino ecosystem. making peoples training on how its activity becomes important. This knowledge allows people to choose Stake Pool to suit their vision and value. Fund. reserve. reward. deposit and fee-often called ADA-POT-with a maximum total supply of 45 billion ADA. Although anyone can review the ada-pot number on the Explorer Blockchain Cardano and on Cardano DB Sync. these platforms can only provide the final output of calculations without any basic data to authenticate the calculation. Although these calculations exist in the Haskell code of Node and Ledger warehouse. they use a complex. highly dispersed formula. Cardano Foundation starts to pursue the calculation of independent rewards with the node. deploy the formulas stated in the Cardano ledger specifications and act as a material to handle special cases in which the formula is indicated not suitable for reality. in one case. an error in the implementation of the node has led to the owner of the Pool running two different pools but has the same reward address that only receives a reward for a Stake Pool. the correction of errors will lead to additional rewards from the budget to be granted to the Pool owner. Although these manual interventions are completely consistent with the protocol specifications and are transparently recorded through the so-called instanted movement reward certificates (MIR)). the Ada-POTs are calculated for this epoch will not be accurate. if people calculate the budget value with this simple formula for this epoch. then it is clear that it does not match the actual number of ada held. if you do not know about such unusual events. the difference between the formula and the budget value will have difficulty tracking and will have less money in the fund more than the formula. The initial reward calculation is integrated into the Ledgersync. the Java -based data link is developed to provide the new Explorer Cardano of Cardano Foundation data from Blockchain Cardano. Cardano Foundations technical group soon realized that the troubleshooting of many components related to the different aspects of the calculation process will be quite complicated. The diversity of input data. including specifications. forums and self -storage community documents.',\n",
       " ' means collecting necessary information from many different sources to comprehensively understand the ADA stream becomes particularly time -consuming. the open source to calculate the reward can empower the public to check. evaluate and verify the algorithm as well as the code used to determine how to distribute the reward. this approach helps build confidence in Cardano infrastructure by acting as a storage inventory that includes interactive charts to explain the ADA thread at the end of Epoch. along with reports highlighting the difference between formula and actual value. It also acts as a useful way to train people about Cardanos decentralized budget system and contribute to providing insight to the use of transaction fees. As an open source archive. the calculation of rewards will attract the community further. promoting people to contribute as many documents as possible. it also provides a technical support tool because it displays an API that allows users to calculate the values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bcurrently available only to Cardano DB Sync. an IOG Haskell tool to collect Node data and make it access to the Postgresql database. As discussed in the example of the previous edge. the use of the next formula for Epoch to calculate. such as the budget value. sometimes will not bring accurate results. This motivation may arise when transferring money to pay Project Catalyst or. such as when using MIR certificate to compensate for the missed pool reward due to errors. Although transparent recorded on the Cardano blockchaino through the MIR certificate. but such special cases are not always recorded in detail. leading to a lack of historical foundation and thus significantly affecting transparency. which leads to uncertainty and reliability. The appropriate document setting can prevent this. allowing the evaluation and audit in the future as well as improving the document. thus strengthening the reliability and ability to recover Cardanos operation. Cardano Foundations work starts with the implementation of the formula and documents on special cases. but some unknown points still need to be resolved. it is necessary to take into account the first Catalyst or Mir Certificate before Epoch 271 because they do not have the super data attached. Through this source of opening. Cardano Foundation hopes to cooperate with community members to establish an independent solution to the data source. we have Koios data providers and data providers for Jonian files to serve synthetic data. an indexing program scope-can be said based on Yaci-Store. a Cardano data warehouse deployment based on Java-will be helpful in ensuring maximum transparency in the reward calculation. This initiative finally relates to the budget value that Cardano uses to sponsor the decentralized development of the ecosystem. general rewards and transaction fees. it directly affects the aspects that all Cardano users should care about. including the implementation of the rewards in the ecosystem they are members. all contributors. whether sharing code or information. plays an important role in bringing more trust and transparency to the ecosystem. thereby improving the conditions to enhance the Blockchain application. Cardano Foundation creates a report along with all new versions of the archive.',\n",
       " ' We have added absolute average difference between calculation and actual budget value as a measure and with the community. we hope to reduce this value over time. Contribute to this archive is not limited to code; People can add data. documents and detailed information about significant differences observed in some epochs. The storage itself follows a test -based approach. so starting by creating tests. such as tests related to specific pool rewards in specific Epochs. The fund only created a report to the fund but we found the potential to introduce this type of report to other components of ADA-POT as well as detailed reports on the selected Stake Pool and future membership rewards. Most of the time. the average budget value is about 3.500 ADA higher than the formulas prediction. The rule of collecting general deposits cannot be received - for example. when a pool stops working and related shares. has been canceled - returning to the budget. each pool can earn maximum ADA value for each epoch. The budget also directs any difference between the value calculated by the formula and the maximum value. These adjustments to the current implementation will reduce the average absolute difference. Cardano Foundation has achieved some success in resolving the basic principles of the calculation and determining the explanation for some of these differences. it will be very valuable if there is a comprehensive document on all transactions sent from the budget. The next steps are also related to the implementation of Pool Reap rules. as well as adding limited rewards to the budget. combining MIR certificates and transferring unexplained rewards to the reserve warehouse. although currently for each new Epoch. we re -set a known value to prevent relayer errors from previous epochs. but in the future. it will be beneficial if there are consumers in the fee scope. the pool has stopped working. the equity account canceled. update pool. This structure will allow dynamic calculation based on previous calculations. if there is another unknown in calculation. leading to the difference between calculations and actual value. the in-depth inspection of Haskell deployment in Cardano-Node and Cardano-Ledger storage can be completed. This scenario aims to identify changes that cause differences by exploring commitment history and discussing problems. Cardano Foundation intends to use interactive reports and charts from this archive to explain the Token ADA economic system for regulatory agencies. businesses and cardano foundation. In September. we also met Pools from Koios CNTools to introduce them to the archive and collect initial feedback. They welcome this initiative as well as the idea of \\\\u200b\\\\u200bdeploying and recording the calculation of the reward and noting that by other developers to turn this Java reference to additional languages \\\\u200b\\\\u200bwill bring additional value. The open source approach always enriches the ecosystem. bringing common benefits to all parties involved. while promoting transparency and improving the ability to widely apply Blockchain technology. Cardano Foundation plans to continue the open source solutions and storage solutions to promote the maturity of Cardanos open source.',\n",
       " ' With the expertise of Blockchain needed to manage individual cardano components. the start of using the network may be a challenge. This move is especially true when developers want to limit the use of centralized solutions or infrastructure management. For those developers. Cardano Foundation recognizes the value of Demeter and how it can promote the application and develop the ecosystem. Demeter is a software platform built to streamline the development process in the Cardano ecosystem and help build more friendly applications (DApps) to developers. As an all -in -one solution. Demeter allows developers to deploy the testnet and mainnet environment easily and quickly. In a broader sense. Demeter is aimed at eliminating the barriers to joining people who want to launch applications on Cardano. Cardano Foundation provided TXpipe. the company behind Demeter. a lump -sum allowance. This funding will allow a free level to provide limited access to the Demeter platform. this tool will allow access to:. Through this participation. the fund intends to resolve a number of challenges related to the development of applications on Blockchain Cardano - which is to attract new developers. Cardano obeys a minimalist approach when it comes to core components. Example*: Node Cardano is only aimed at doing what is needed to ensure network performance. the node only stores the necessary information to monitor and verify the chain. many responsibilities are pushed into workstation applications. This approach is aimed at maintaining the core components at a reasonable level and allowing the ecosystem to develop in parallel with the necessary modular solutions. for new Cardano users. this motivation can be overworked because the development process requires simultaneous use of many tools. From the chain index. the transaction. the chain followers and the discovery. there are countless existing tools that once they are reasonably coordinated. can solve almost all issues in reality. Some typical tools found in Cardano development environment include:. With the diversity of modules. Demeter platforms become especially useful in helping developers start with Cardano. Demeter makes the coordination and deployment of these ingredients simple. This motivation allows seamless integration. encouraging innovation in the Cardano ecosystem. In addition to the starting process. typical infrastructure components are in Cardano development environment that requires significant resources to operate. such as CPU. memory and disk storage. If we think that. during the development process. the developer may need to connect with some Cardano networks. such as preview. Pre-Product. main network. Then resource requirements may become limited to some developers - even strong machine users. Data must also be synchronized from every network each time. making the environmental setting up become especially bulky. Some standard techniques exist to minimize the problem. for example*: Using the workload packed in the container may be paused during the time of operation. Although valid. these solutions provide partial solutions and often require configuration as well as connect parts manually and individually. The better use of resources will be sharing versions of these infrastructure components between some developers. The relationship between infrastructure and developers must follow the ratio 1: N.',\n",
       " ' with the cost of operating infrastructure divided by some participants. As a cloud -based solution. Demeter allows more participants to share infrastructure costs. which encourages more developers to participate in Cardano ecosystem. This motivation promotes a vibrant and sustainable developer community. promotes innovation and growth while minimizing financial burden on individual developers. Blockchain development includes many areas: Developing user interface. developing auxiliary. developing smart contracts. Although most of the core cardano development process still focuses on Haskell. the trend of introducing different languages \\\\u200b\\\\u200band programming frames has been noticed. many good libraries and ecosystems exist in alternative languages \\\\u200b\\\\u200bsuch as Rust. GO or C#. This trend can also be clearly seen on-chain with the introduction of new programming platforms such as Aiken or Helios. these platforms offer attractive alternatives for Haskell. Demeter provides a unified platform to synthesize resources and tools for those ecosystems. This motivation streamlines the development process. helping developers on many different platforms more accessible and effective. promoting the cohesive and cooperative environment to build on Cardano. The application of a large -scale cardano also requires attracting developers outside the current ecosystem. addressing the most advanced expectations and providing appropriate testing environmental developers. The support of temporary sandbox environment. full of ability to operate in a few minutes will provide developers to test the practical projects. showing the capabilities of their system. Demeter sets the same strategic application goals. providing extensions that support the Sandbox or TestNet environment. allowing developers to tweak and verify their projects without having to bear the burden of infrastructure management. After ready. they can continue to store it on the demeter or set in their settings in the form of Terraform or Kubernetes configuration - the two technologies are widely used to manage infrastructure. Many Cardano ecosystem services provide API -based API to facilitate blockchain interactions at a high abstract level (e. *: Block Frost. Koios. Gomaestro. These services eliminate complexity when interacting with the basic component layer. projects that need to be fine -tuning or projects that require a more flexible working process will also require access to lower levels. Some Blockchain protocol provides services at different levels of abstract. both high -level API abstraction and low -level protocol points. Example*: Solutions that provide node as a service have become popular. Demeter gives developers flexible to work at an abstract level to suit their needs. whether they require simplifying interface or more intensive protocol access. This flexibility can enhance the attractiveness and usability of the Cardano ecosystem. attract more developers and cases of more comprehensive use. Demeter provides cloud environment by Cardano Foundation in clusters. A cluster represents a group of calculating resources and tools that different projects can be used simultaneously in the way that is controlled and measured. The clusters are elastic. meaning that they automatically obtain more resources when needed and narrowed during idle time. The Demeter project is defined as one or more developers interacting with the cluster to build and deploy Cardano Dapps. On each cluster.',\n",
       " ' developers can activate many different extensions to access different useful services. This comprehensive tool supports the Cardano ecosystem by rationalizing the development process in a unified foundation. the Demeter simplifies access to data and blockchain services and allows to create a strong testing environment. In accordance with the support of Cardano Foundation for projects that contribute significantly to the ecosystem. especially projects that may have a great impact in the future. we have decided to collaborate with TXPIPE and grant the ecosystem access to the Demeter level for free. By structure of the funds fund in this way. we want to help TXPIPE reach more objects. expand the attractiveness of Cardano network and promote innovation on the whole ecosystem. Since TXPIPE activated the free cluster in the EU area on June 21. some user indicators have shown significant growth. in August:. in September:. With the free level of participation from September 30. the Fund will now consider its overall impact. in order to determine the effectiveness of the funding. If these findings show that the number of users is increasing. there may be more opportunities to cooperate with TXPIPE in future application initiatives. Sponsored by Cardano Foundation (each user only receives the subsidy for the first project they created).October 30. EDINBURGH decentralized index project (EDI) is for the purpose of measuring decentralized quality of blockchain networks systematically. The group has announced the issuance of a tool that can measure decentralized quality production for some blockchain projects. We collected data on Cardano and Bitcoin. The EDI group has identified 8 criteria that the group plans to measure decentralization. These criteria include hardware. token economy. API workstation application. administration and geography*. you can see that geography and governance are special because they involve all the remaining 6 criteria. Measuring decentralization is a complex task and the group will constantly introduce new methods to measure each individual area. The group presented a tool to measure the decentralization of different blockchain networks. it focuses on block production. There is a free CLI tool on GitHub that can collect data and assign blocks to each entity that has created them. From the data. the mass of mass can be observed by individual block manufacturers for a certain period of time (according to the default monthly). Some data can be applied to data collected so that it is possible to get the final result (CSV file and chart). This tool can be used for the following blockchain: Bitcoin. Zcash. We have used tools for Cardano and Bitcoin to see how many independent entities are producing blocks each month. Use June as a reference month. we only consider the table in the past 3 years. because the POS consensus mechanism allows the public to participate in the block production process that has been implemented by HardFork Shelley. the blocks are created by more than 1.000 entities. The multi -group operator is listed on a line in the table with data. we consider data for the past 6 years.',\n",
       " ' We can see that block manufacturers have dropped below 20 times in 2022 and exceeded 30 times in 2019. Lets take a look at the top 25 manufacturers for Cardano and Bitcoin. The result was in June 2023. 136.076 blocks were cast in Cardano network during this period. 4313 blocks in Bitcoin network. we see all blocks exploited in a table because there are less than 25 pools. 24 pools have cast more than 1.000 blocks. 279 Pool exploits more than 100 blocks per month. 785 pool exploits less than 100 blocks per month. 80 pool creates 1 block per month (ie 1 block for 6 epoch). The largest 50 pool cast more than 50% of the blocks per month. the 2 largest pools exploit more than 50% of the blocks per month (MAV is 2). Only 6 pools exploit more than 100 blocks. the largest pool is 3. 7 times larger than the fifth pool. this ratio is 3. the largest pool is 23. 9 times larger than the tenth pool. the largest pool has a relatively strong position compared to other pools. Bitcoin has a small number of block manufacturers (pool) and the first 5 pools with significant power positions compared to other pools. Cardano has a large number of block manufacturers. but the first 24 pools dominate (in terms of casting blocks). Modeling is only one input to measure decentralization. but it is likely that it will be one of the more important inputs. The mass production depends on holding an expensive resource. We hope to see the extended utility providing power authorization data in the near future. Download the tool and try to see the decentralization of your favorite blockchain.October 26. A friendly data protection blockchain and easy -to -use platform to develop and run decentralized applications being released to the world. Blockchain has been decentralized and programmed since 2015. but concerns about the public properties of technology have limited more widely application. Midnight resolves those issues and empower developers to build applications to protect sensitive data of individuals and organizations. Because Midnight is in the development stage. some features are still being discovered. Some features described here may not be accessible in Pre-Product releases. The first issue Midnight sought to solve data concerns about data protection. Financial. insurance and e -commerce applications need a lot of data. most of that data should not be provided on the public ledger. Midnight provides developers to build DAPPS to control which data is public and which data is located in private mode. thus allowing selective disclosure. Midnight also protects super data - data on data. the super data of phone calls can be used to reveal the identities of both parties. the time and the call amount are made. Blockchain often reveals transactions for people with appropriate applications. including good and bad people. Midnight provides features such as protected tokens that allow interactions to occur without leaks of super data (for example. wallet addresses and transaction details are kept safely).',\n",
       " ' Dapps can provide sensitive super data to the same level as other secret data. if not all industries are affected by data -related regulations. The role of application builders is to ensure that their solutions comply with appropriate regulations. depending on factors such as the nature of the activity. the legal area they operate and their objects. The flexibility of Midnight in drafting DApps can operate anywhere on a scope from completely public to completely private. giving developers free to build data protection applications. and comply with legal obligations. Midnights data protection further enhances DAPPSs privacy law and meets customers expectations for keeping their data safely. Midnight is designed to make the developers journey as easily as possible. The developers are familiar with TypeScript will comfortably write Dapps at Midnight. Most of the professional logic and user interface code are written in this famous language and important contract components written in language specifically for specially designed fields to integrate seamlessly with TypeScript. There is even plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio Code so that everyone can work with the familiar IDE. When Dapps is running. they will use Midnight data protection features to balance safety and compliance. Zero-Knowledge (ZK) is a technology that allows data protection and allows others to access that data. ZK allows one person (the proof) to make a statement that others (verification) can know that it is right without the provider that must share any other information. ZK evidence can be used to make comments such as:. In cases like this. affirmation may be proven without disclosing basic information. Midnight provides tools to build DAPPS to comply with regulations. use these improved features to achieve its goals:. But Midnight not only has technology. The creators are gathering leaders in the industry. content creators and organizations that want to promote responsible data management worldwide. The group of these innovations will arouse ideas. create content. contribute code and organize events that everyone can participate. encourage training. inspiration and promote changes in different fields and locations. We welcome you to join this journey with Midnight. Follow us on Twitter/x #MIDNIGHTNETWORK or on LinkedIn. From the viewpoint of application developers. the UTXO model is basically different from the account -based model. The account -based model is very simple and gives the developer highly flexible. especially if it is necessary to determine complicated enforcement logic. excessive flexibility will pay the price by ensuring the performance. leading to security holes and system attacks. Working with the UTXO model is more complex but it gives developers (and is therefore a user) a number of advantages. which is Determinism. Please explain it more in detail. determination (Determinism) related to a blockchain system must implement the rules and regulations in a homogeneous and predictable manner. the determination* in the blockchain can refer to the following aspects:. Test of transaction*: All transactions in the Blockchain must be done in a similar and predictable way. This ensures that transactions will not have unforeseen changes. and all changes in the state of blockchain can be predicted based on previous transactions.',\n",
       " ' The results of the results*: All buttons on the Blockchain network. after processing a chain of transactions. must reach the same final state. This ensures the consensus in the network and prevents the divergence in the state of the blockchain. Estimation of encryption*: The algorithms and hash functions in the blockchain must also be done in all nodes on all buttons. ensuring the consensus of encryption. This is especially important in verifying digital signatures and the integrity of data on Blockchain. The determination is an important factor to ensure the consensus and reliability in the Blockchain network. It helps ensure that all members of the network can check and verify transactions and state independently and achieve the same result. helping to prevent problems such as fraud and intrusion. a transaction can be considered as an agent using one or more head utxo to produce one or more output UTXOs. UTXOs participating in the transaction are unmistakable and as we will present later. from the users perspective. can ensure exclusive access. it is necessary to ensure that the value of the input UTXO is equal to the value of all output UTXOs. At the level of authentication of all transactions in the block. it is possible to ensure the ability to protect from a double spending attack. because each input UTXO can only be used once and completely. Each new block is added to the ledger determining the status change related to UTXO ownership. Local verification can be verified that input UTXOs can be used by a transaction (ie used). Local predictions can be affected by on-chain state. the off-chain logic (user or application) can ensure that the transaction will not fail if sent online. A transaction almost certainly will never fail if the user (or agent) has the exclusive UTXO input spending. This is the case of Alice sending coins or tokens to Bob from her own wallet. Utxo input cannot be used by anyone else. Consider the only possibility when trading may fail. this is limited to many factors that can be used with the same UTXO. As we will present later. this can happen to the liquidity pool. you can see how two factors are trying to build a transaction. Both agents have the latest status of the ledger exactly. Unconsciously coinciding. they chose the same UTXO input. The local off-chain authentication will be successful. both agents sent transactions online and said that the authentication of on-chain transactions will also succeed. each UTXO can only be used once. only one transaction will be successful and the remaining transaction will fail. you can see that in the back block. only 1 transaction is recorded in the ledger. Transaction 2 failed. As we have explained. this status can only occur if users use the application in which UTXO is shared together. Now lets imagine a decentralized trading floor (DEX) usually using some liquidity pools. Each liquidity pool can be considered as a collection containing some UTXO with different values. Users send transactions to perform swap basically want to receive a part of liquidity (tokens) in the liquidity pool.',\n",
       " ' they want to receive one or more UTXO from the liquidity pool. users can send swap transactions (almost) in parallel and compete for liquidity. The key point is the selection of input UTXO for transactions. The agents must synchronize with each other if the transaction fails. Cardano can build such an application to ensure that users transactions never fail. Off-chain application logic must synchronize with each other. it is possible to pre -order a specific UTXO from the general liquidity pool before sending the transaction. local off-chain authentication can ensure that the transaction is almost certainly not failed. you can see that there is an off-chain synchronization between the agents before the local transaction authentication. Each reserve agent of a different UTXO. so both transactions sent can be said to exceed the on-chain authentication. it will only work if UTXO reserves can be reserved. It may also happen that there is no appropriate UTXO when users try to send transactions. you can wait (and do not send transactions) or take risks and wait if the appropriate UTXO does not appear later. The details depend on the implementation of DEX and the specific user interface. The EUTXO model contributes to improving the security and determination of Cardano. transactions do not depend on the account or user balance as in the case of an account -based model but only depends on the UTXO related to the transaction. This means that for a certain transaction. only related UTXOs are important. not a global user account. In the UTXO model. the balance of a specific account is basically only a general figure of the list of UTXOs at addresses belonging to a owner. The blockchain has an account -based ledger model that is not determined because the influence of transactions on the ledger is unpredictable. The reason is that the user account balance can be changed. In the account -based blockchain. a transaction can be considered as a function to change the account balance. Each transaction involves the transfer of tokens or tokens from one account to another will change the balance of those accounts. The authentication of transactions depends on their account and their balance. This can lead to unintentional behavior. as the result of the transaction depends on the state of the blockchain at the exact time that they are put into a block. Accounts can be considered as a shared resource (shared) in the system. This is because all transactions are processed by the entire network and every single transaction that can affect the status of any account in the system. The common nature of these accounts is one of the reasons why Ethereum and Blockchain use other account ledger model is considered as a state blockchain. Transactions in Ethereum can be considered as a state. The complete state of Ethereum describes the current state of all accounts and balances. as well as the common memory of all smart contracts deployed and runs in EVM. The current state of accounts may be changed by single transactions.',\n",
       " ' Please return to our example in which two users (agents) are trying to send swap transactions to receive a part of liquidity (tokens) from the liquidity pool. Can not reserve a specific balance for a transaction the same way you can store UTXO in Cardano. If the transaction may reserve a part of the balance from the liquidity pool and then it is not included in the blockchain for a long time (may be due to low fees). then they will block the implementation of the next swap transactions. In a way. individual applications also depend on each other because the operation of the network affects gas costs. Gas costs affect the selection of transactions and their order in the block. This leads to unmistakable behavior. In the AMM model. the liquidity pool is basically a reserve of two or more tokens locked in smart contracts. Users deal with these smart contracts. not together and exchange rates based on mathematical formulas. users compete to gain balance or liquidity in a certain liquidity pool. When users send parallel transactions. the Ethereum network will prioritize transactions based on gas fees. The higher the gas fee that users are willing to pay. the higher the level of their transactions. This means that higher charges will be processed first and have the opportunity to use the first liquidity. The competition of this liquidity can lead to the so -called gas wars (GAS). in which users constantly pay higher prices than each others gas fees to try to handle their transactions as quickly as possible. This is one of the reasons why trading fees on Ethereum can sometimes rise. you can see the two agents want to use the same balance. Both agents found that the balance was sufficient for their transactions and thus sending the transaction at the same time. The first agent set a higher fee than the second agent. The sent transactions are not guaranteed to be successful. but basically. users must take risks and try to send if they want to perform swap. A low -fee transaction may be delayed and other transactions with higher fees may be prioritized. Transactions at low fees may fail. The fee will be counted regardless of the final state. users pay for swap efforts without guarantee that swap will take place. You can see that in the picture. only one transaction is successful due to the higher fee. Transaction 1 has drained a large amount of liquidity from the group to the level of transaction 2 cannot be done. The second agent still has to pay for the 2nd transaction. 😢 😢. As described. factors cannot synchronize and reserve a part of the balance in the liquidity pool. The agent only responds to a valid state at the time they try to send the transaction. From a fairly equal perspective. the lack of determination is also detrimental because it creates opportunities for the opposite agents to abuse network gaps. Many of the previous attacks (front-running attacks) have been known.',\n",
       " ' in which the BOT scans transactions in the memory group and search for suitable opportunities so they can make profits. If they find such transactions. they only need to send a similar transaction at a higher fee. In our case. this means that the transaction of both agents will fail. because the attacker will be able to withdraw all liquidity from the pool for himself first. a similar attack (Front-Running attack) will fail if there is an off-chain pre-reserved system in which the agents can pre-order a specific UTXO for themselves. Application developers often prefer account -based models because it is simple and easy to work. Basic applications only work with balance. the disadvantage is that transactions do not work in a definite and may fail. This is due to the fact that the user sent transactions until it was executed. the general state of the system. ie the balance on the account. may change. The more complicated UTXO model to understand and the choice of input UTXO seems a bit bulky. Deducting a amount from an account and recorded in another account will be easier to choose more UTXO and create new output utxo from them (including the utxo returns a part of the original address value). Developers are forced to think about parallel applications. They must ensure the synchronization between agents so that the dispute does not occur. from the perspective of the user. it can create such applications that will operate in a definite manner. If the local off-chain authentication process successfully. the on-chain authentication process will also succeed. And of course. users will not have to pay for failures just because the system lacks the determination of blockchain using the account ledger model. 👍 👍 👍.October 25. Midnight is still in the stage where developers can try on Dev-Net. The community is curious about what the relationship between Midnight and Cardano will be like. We do not have enough information right now. but some things can be predicted. Midnight will be said to be a sidechain with a separate consensus mechanism based on POS+POW. it will be independent of Cardano because it can provide its own security. Midnight may not need to use Cardano and Adas POS consensus mechanism. At the end of the article we will return to the question about the position of Sidechain. Midnight will have token dust. Currently we do not know if there will be only one token for both POS and POW. The question is whether the existing Spo Cardano is involved. Our understanding is that it will be possible. SPOs may run Midnight workstation app and receive rewards as tokens dust. The POW consensus will mainly provide the immutability of the ledger. Regarding the initial distribution of Token Dust. we did not know for sure. it was speculated that some Dust tokens could be given to those who were holding ADA. Perhaps it was mentioned at a certain conference. If the development group uses this option. about 1. 3 million Stake Ada people can now receive Dust tokens.',\n",
       " ' Although this seems to be a good idea. it is not sure that it will happen. in the context of POW. it would be more beneficial if all the Dust tokens were gradually exploited. for the POS network. it is necessary to bring money to the largest number of Stake people possible in a short period of time. Midnight project group will have to think carefully about the economic model and fair token distribution. It is important to be secure. Midnight will most likely be closed and completely independent of Cardano with its own economic model. Midnight focuses on privacy using Zero-Knowledge code. This means that the ledger will not be public. more precisely to read very little information in it. Is transferring tokens from Cardano to Midnight and vice versa?. Midnight can bring privacy to Cardano users. We assume that we can transfer ADA. tokens (NFT. ) from Cardano to Midnight and use private services such as payment. swap. loan. The tokens will be cast at Sidechain Midnight will not make any sense when switching to the Cardano ecosystem because their privacy will be partially violated. we still do not know if Midnight can cast and burn tokens. It is expected that Midnight will be able to do this because all the tokens are cast on Cardano basically losing a privacy. It can be said that Midnight will not be able to cast tokens and will only use the tokens transferred from cardano and other chains. this will make sense for stablecoin supported by USD will only be cast and burned on cardano. but using them in a private way will be able to be done in Midnight. This will always help you easily know how many tokens are cast. there will be a very strong link between Cardano and Midnight. It can be said that the existence of Midnight will depend a lot on cardano. some information may be read from the Midnight ledger and the number of casted tokens or currently may be one of them. According to the latest comment of Charles Hoskinson. it seems that Midnight will have a private ledger and a public ledger. A decentralized identification solution (DID) requires a public blockchain. we can imagine the integration between Cardano. Atala Prism (identity management solution) and Midnight is probably the best. DID must exist in Cardano (although Midnight can also publish this information) and Midnight will allow more powerful personal information to protect. The Zero-Knowledge evidence helps the verificationer can convince the truth without having to reveal the nature of the information. See more articles about the combination of DID and ZK here. Alice can convince Bob that she has an ID granted by the government and she is over 18 years old. Bob can verify this information without knowing Alices real age. But again. Midnight may have a DID solution without using Cardano. all that it needs is to integrate with Atala Prism. The present cannot be said for sure. It will depend on how Cardano and Midnight will be connected to the economy.',\n",
       " ' at infrastructure level and function. Midnight will provide privacy for Cardano users. Midnight will be an ally. We think that in some cases of use. Midnight can operate without cardano completely. It will not mean anything if part of the information is made in the Cardano ledger and a part of private information on Midnight. Some businesses. banks or financial institutions will require 100%privacy. It will not mean anything if the tokens are cast on Cardano and switch to Midnight or use decentralized applications on Cardano from Midnight applications. Many users require privacy for all financial transactions. From the viewpoint of current financial services. this is the standard. because the public does not have the opportunity to learn about the loan between you and the bank. such as from some public documents. the cashier cannot see your wallet status or account after you pay the goods for her. We can imagine that in some cases of use. Midnight may be a competitor to Cardano. Most people ask for privacy. That is the case of privacy of the business. Or cases with high privacy requirements. If a DEX is launched on the Midnight platform (and this is entirely possible). it can suck liquidity and appropriate users from the DEX on Cardano. Midnight may also be able to speak better and therefore lower fees. Midnight may be a sought -after solution even for those who hold the organizers who want to pay via BTC. Lightning Network will never be a 100% private solution due to online transactions to open and close Lightning Network channels. If the owner transfers some BTC to Midnight. they can use them there for a relatively long time. They can completely spend BTC until Midnight and do not need to make any other payment transactions after spending. It would be great if Cardano was used to encrypt BTC and then the tokens (WBTC) were transferred to Midnight. but we could imagine that Midnight would have its own encryption solution. According to the latest statements. it seems that Midnight will be able to do this in a self -control and independent manner. It is important to mention that any conclusions at this time are not necessary because there is very little information published widely. We can imagine an integration that will benefit Cardano users and the owner of ADA. but it is also a large integration without Cardano and only use Cardano Spo. Stake Ada people can receive Dust prizes if the Pool operators will definitely run the Midnight workstation app. Stakers will almost certainly have to hold not only ADA but also Dust. Anyone who is interested will most likely be able to run the Midnight workstation application without having to run the cardano workstation app. so Midnight may have its own infrastructure. The question is why Midnight is really marketed in the form of Sidechain when it seems it will be a separate network that is largely independent of Cardano. On his official website. Midnight describes himself as a blockchain.',\n",
       " ' not sidechain. Cardano is not mentioned. This is similar on the X (Twitter) platform. It is difficult to predict the future of any project in the blockchain industry. it seems that Midnight will be the fourth generation blockchain and can do what most of the current blockchain cannot do. Midnight may expand the scale. protect the privacy of users selectively and have private smart contracts. Cardano users will be able to use Midnight. but it is likely that they will be able to convert it completely to it. Perhaps the Cardano community will decide to have some features of Midnight in Cardano and will request (through the On-Chain management mechanisms) IOG group deployed them. Midnight must be a completely open source. This may be a conclusion too early at this time. Please wait for more information.October 24. The combination of technologies can lead to new use cases. Cardano has Atala Prism project. a decentralized identity management system (abbreviated as DID - Decentralized Identity). Midnight project will soon be launched. this project will be able to use Zero-Knowledge (ZK) evidence. Think about what can be achieved by combining these projects. A decentralized identity is a way to use Blockchain technology to create and manage digital identities (DID) that is portable. reliable and autonomous. DID is the only identification number created in general keywords and can be published on public blockchain like Cardano. Anyone in the world can create their own DID without the permission of a third party. And an entity can even create many DIDs. DID himself is mainly used to prove that you are the owner of that DID. That is the only identification code you control and can be used to verify yourself in digital space. DID himself does not provide information about identity in your real world. That is when the verification information can be verified (VC - Verifiable Credentials) appears. can be linked to your DID and provides authentication of identity in your real world. The verification information can be verified as the main component of a decentralized identification system. They are digital information of physical verification information such as passports. drivers license or member card. VC is linked to DID. A competent authority (VC publisher). such as the Government. organized training or other reliable organizations. can create VC and assign it to a specific DID. VC may be any confirmation made by the issuing organization for the person holding DID. This may include confirmation of identity. capabilities. achievements or any other object attributes. the Government may issue VC confirmed that a person who is a citizen of a certain country or a university can grant VC confirmed that a person has received a certain degree. the Ministry of Education and Training in Ethiopia is deploying Atala Prism for this purpose. The interaction between the proof (the person holding the DID) and the verification (the identity of the identity or the statement of the proof) usually includes the following steps:. The accuracy of VC is guaranteed through the use of encryption techniques.',\n",
       " ' When the publisher created VC. they signed it with their own key. This creates a digital signature that can be used to verify that VC is actually from the publisher who is confirmed ownership and is not fake. The publishers public key. can be used to verify the digital signature. often published on the Blockchain with their DID. The verification process uses data from both blockchain and proofs to verify VC. the verification takes place quickly and is always available by using Blockchain. The interaction between the proof and the verification person can be encrypted to protect the data during the transmission through the Internet. This is usually done using safe communication protocols like HTTPS. After the data reaches the verification person. the verification person can decode and view that data. This is necessary for VC testers and evidence provided by the proof. Digital signature plays an important role in this process. They are used to ensure that VC is not fake and it actually comes from the publisher who is confirmed ownership. The proof also uses digital signatures to prove that they are the legal owner of VC. although data protection encryption during transmission. it does not hide data from the verification person. Thats when technologies like Zero-Knowledge Proofs appear. allowing users to prove everything about their identity without disclosing basic data. Evidence ZK (Zero-Knowledge) can be used as an additional layer to hide data even for verification. This is a powerful tool to protect privacy in decentralized identification systems and other applications that need sensitive data protection. Consider an example in which users want to prove their nationality. age and income on a certain threshold without revealing actual data to the verification. Call him Bob. the verification process may be CEX or DEX. according to the law. it must ensure that citizens from certain countries or terrorists do not trade on it. only adults have a certain income to trade on it. The exchange does not want to retain user data (for security reasons) but want to comply with the requirements of the management agency. Assuming that the management agency does not require the trading floor to collect personal information about the transaction house. BOB (DID holder) has necessary VCs from the competent authorities (government and employer) and wants to trade on a trading floor that needs verification of identity. age and income. Bob uses VC to create evidence ZK proves that he is a citizen of a certain country (does not disclose his accurate nationality). that he is over 18 years old (does not disclose his accurate age) and his income is higher than a certain threshold (not disclosing his accurate income). Bob sent DID including evidence of ownership (digital signatures) and all ZK evidence to the verification. The verificationer checks the ZK evidence by using the common lock linked to the users DID. Some challenges-regression rounds will take place so that the verification person can be sure of ZK evidence. If the verification process is successful.',\n",
       " ' the verification will accept Bobs requirements without knowing the nationality. age or actual income of users. The positive thing is that technology will be able to allow users to control their privacy and choose which data will provide for third parties. Some governments and organizations are discovering these technologies because their potential is to improve their privacy and security. These technologies can improve their privacy but also set new challenges. The authorities need to balance the privacy benefits of these technologies with other considerations such as security. regulations and compliance. although the authorities may allow the use of DID and ZK evidence. it can also be said that they still want to maintain some levels of control and monitoring. This may be related to the establishment of standards on how to use these technologies or require certain types of disclosure or tests in specific contexts.October 18. The first generation of network consensus followed the sequential principle. because the blockchain has a linear structure. Sequating processing is often a sign of all new technologies. Low efficiency often hinder mass application or use wider technology. you can find many technologies including parallel. which leads to more applicability or higher efficiency. We will give a few examples. Today we can see examples of parallel chemistry in the blockchain industry. Cardano has some advantages. In computer technology. the sequential system is the system in which the activities are carried out in turn in a specific order. Tasks or instructions are done in turn in the order they are received or programmed. Self -sequential systems usually have a single processor. only executing one command at a time. This means that with the same input. they will always create the same output. This is because the order is fixed and does not change. Synchronization is essential because each operation must be completed before the next operation may begin. There is no need to have clear synchronization mechanisms such as locks or semantics required in parallel systems to prevent racing. it can be said that the sequential systems will be easy to understand. design and deploy more simply. They are determined (deterministic0 and there is no problem with synchronization. Improving performance in the sequential system is often associated with speeding up the processor or optimizing codes to reduce the number of commands. Sequence may not be well expanded when the workload is increasing because many tasks may be handled at the same time. The resources may not be used properly with the sequential system. A decentralized network with a simple network consensus that Cardano has. there are both sequential and parallel aspects. projects may vary in some details. Blockchain has a unique structure of linear. a new block is always added after the previous block. The current version of Ouroboros POS has a sequential property. because a new block is created regularly. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the same in this respect. The difference between these networks is only the length of the blocking period. There are many nodes (CPUs) in the dispersed network.',\n",
       " ' but due to the time of producing blocks. a new block is created by a node at a time. Each node in the network may have similar transactions in Mem-Pool (but transactions can come in different order). but only transactions from a new mem-pool are used in the production process. the diffusion of blocks in the network takes place in parallel. The parallel system refers to a system in which many tasks or operations are performed simultaneously. ie at the same time. These systems often require the participation of many multi -core processors. which can be performed simultaneously. Parallel systems will support simultaneously. in which some tasks seem to run at the same time. Synchronous mechanisms such as locking or semantic are often used to prevent competition and ensure that the streams simultaneously run mutual exclusion activities correctly. Parallel systems can take advantage of the ability of a multi -core processor or dispersed computer resource. It improves performance and expansion. this also brings some technology challenges. Parallel systems are often more complicated in designing and deploying compared to the free weekly circulating systems with simultaneous tasks and communications. Synchronization and communication can cause significant costs and can reduce performance. The current Ethereum POS is related to a parallel form in which many people authenticate a proposed block. A new block was approved by many people before it was added to the blockchain. this approval process does not mean that the block has been completed. Ethereums consensus mechanism can be more effective and significantly reduces the transaction time. Finality refers to the time when transactions in a block are considered irreversible. Both Bitcoin and Cardano use probabilistic finality. which means that the completion of the probability and probability transactions increases when each new block is added. The completion of sequentially achieved because each new block is added to the string will increase the completion of previous transactions. This can be considered a slow and ineffective process (however. it has other advantages. such as sustainability). the completion is clearer and can be achieved faster. A block is considered to be completed when it is put into the string and there is enough verification to verify its validity. This process can be performed in parallel because different authentication processes can be certified for different blocks at the same time. This is an example of parallel chemicals that can make the consensus more effective. I believe one of the reasons for the current low blockchain network application is due to its ability to expand and effectively. Global decentralized trading network or even decentralized applications (mainly DEFI) is a reasonable concept that can break through many industries and push the ability of the Internet to a new level. The deployment of other parallel factors will allow higher greater blockchain network applications within one (or two) decades. Lets look back at the history of some sequential technologies from the beginning and that parallel has helped to accept and use more. Do you know what the first connection between computers looks like? It takes place sequentially.',\n",
       " ' A single path is used to transfer data between two points. Data (byte) is sent sequentially from point A to point B. If the Internet is like that. it will never take off. Modern networks use multi -road routing techniques to transmit data simultaneously through multiple paths. It can increase bandwidth by creating multiple waiting lists. It also provides a great degree of error. In the traditional hard drive. the data is read sequentially from the rotating disk. The disks with a reader (and record) must be placed in the place of data. The data is mainly stored sequentially to be able to read in one time. with the introduction of Raid technology (independent backup array). data can be distributed on many drives and read or write in parallel. significantly improving performance. The traditional CPU is single core. meaning they can only handle one operation at a time. When needing to work in parallel with many tasks. the CPU must quickly switch between individual tasks (mainly UI and some other tasks). Modern CPUs have many cores. which means they can handle multiple activity by dividing the workload by multiple cores. Thanks to that. you can listen to a song. download data from the internet. write messages and run anti-virus software in the background mode. A traditional database system handles queries in a sequential way. This means that when a query is executed. the database system will access or update the data a record at a time. if you are running a query to find data from a table with millions of records. the database system will scan each record until you find the record matching with the query criteria. as the amount of data increases. this sequential approach becomes less effective. In parallel database. when a query is executed. the database system will divide the data into sub -sets and handle each set of children. Multiplexing is a method that combines many similar signals or numbers into one signal on a shared means. The goal is to share a scarce resource - a physical transmission. in telecommunications. many phone calls can be done by a line. The transplanting signal is transmitted through communication channels as cable. The combination channel divides the capacity of the communication channel into multiple logical channels. a channel for each message or data stream transmitted. An opposite process. called a channel separation. extracted the original channels at the receiver. There are many similar examples and parallel factors that can be found in almost all modern technologies. especially in the computer and network world. Achieving the consensus of the network in a decentralized network is very inefficient. The inefficiency increased with the number of nodes in the middle of that consensus because there was a need for mutual communication. This sequential handling can become a bottle -necked button when the network is processing a large trading volume. The sequential nature of block production may limit the speed of transactions confirmed and added to the blockchain. Consider the parallel forms possible in the blockchain industry.',\n",
       " ' There are more options to achieve higher parallel in the blockchain industry. Class architecture seems to be a simpler solution. Class architecture is a method of organizing systems into separate layers. in which each layer provides services for the upper layer and uses services from the layer below it. A more complicated solution is the effort to achieve the parallelization of the first class. which is in Blockchains network consensus. Classification architecture allows parallel handling of transactions. improving expansion and efficiency. the second class (still early for the third grade) still depends heavily on the expansion of Blockchain. The transfer of property between classes often requires on-chain transactions. The handling of transactions in the second class does not depend on the network consensus of the first class (Blockchain). Different second layers may have different attributes. The higher expansion ability often achieves a decentralized and lower trade -off way. The parallel process in Hydra or Lightning Network occurs by creating communication channels between users. Transactions in channels are only verified by users related to transactions. Lightning Network will allow opening a channel between two participants. Hydra will allow users to open multiple channels for less participants. many parallel transactions in different channels can take place at the same time. Because the channels are independent of each other. the nodes do not interfere with each other in verifying the transaction. Sidechains and Rollups are other solutions that allow paralleling transactions and executing smart contracts. The handling is done off-chain. but there is still dependence on on-chain transactions. Each second layer has some advantages and disadvantages. it is difficult to predict which type will be most popular in the future. communication between classes is still a hidden bottle. If the Blockchain network consensus is not good. users may be difficult to take advantage of the second layer. the second layer may not be the final solution and the groups must achieve higher parallel level at the level of network consensus. Technologies such as Endoser or Sharding input to allow higher parallel network consensus. Input endoser is allowed to separate the selection and authentication before the transactions from the block production process. there are several types of blocks that nodes can operate in parallel. Each type has a different purpose. There are some dependence between all types of blocks and only one type used to maintain linear calculation. Computer resources are used better in the network and Input Endoser increases transactions. Sharding is a technique in which the network is divided into smaller parts (or segments). each part can handle smart transactions and contracts independently. This allows to achieve parallel levels because transactions in different segments can be handled simultaneously. the segments still depend on each other and therefore the communication between segments occurs. It is necessary to maintain the unified overall state throughout the system. ie on segments. Cardano has a certain advantage because the development team has decided to use the UTXO accounting model. With this model. the achievement of higher parallel network consensus is relatively easy.',\n",
       " ' The authentication of transactions and smart contracts is mostly independent of each other. The UTXO model makes it easy to design the Endoser Input. this model is a challenge for application developers. they should consider the design of applications that are aware of parallel. It may take some time before we see the applications that make the most of the potential in parallel. Ethereum handled better. Building an application is relatively easy and groups do not have to solve problems simultaneously. it is difficult to achieve a higher parallel parallel (affecting the size of the scale). The parallelization has had a profound impact on the world. Without parallel. many technological advances that we see today will not be able to do it. The ability to perform multiple tasks at the same time is very important in processing increasing data volume created in our digital era. Parallel calculations have allowed the development of high -performance computers and servers that can handle large amounts of data and perform complex calculations quickly. It is the foundation for training complicated AI models. the network has significantly improved the speed. reliability and efficiency of data transmission and processing. many groups. including IOG. use parallel techniques to improve the expansion and efficiency of the Blockchain network. This will allow more widely use of this technology and break down many industries. basically the same way as the computer or the Internet has succeeded in the past.October 16. When people show the Blockchain attack. 51% attacks are most often mentioned. It is often said that the attacker must gain the right to dominate the resources used in the consensus of a certain network. That will be expensive. the attacker does not always have to buy direct resources. What happens if resources can be given through social techniques. for example or by hacking some computers?. Blockchain network is vulnerable. Their security is based on the assumption that the attack is extremely expensive. the attacker will not be ready to spend more resources for the attack than the honest participants. Achieving the dominance in holding an expensive resource. ADA in the case of Cardano or the hash ratio in the case of Bitcoin. is completely feasible. But this attack is really extremely expensive. Achieving the dominant position in owning resources allows the attacker to be superior to the rest of the network in block production. This opens the ability for an attacker to abuse his dominant position. The minimum cost for a 51% attack on Cardano will currently be about $ 3 billion. We only calculate the nominal market price of Token ADA that the attacker needs to own. But in fact. as increasing demand will increase the market price of tokens also increased without being included in the above calculation. the actual attack on Cardano network may be even more expensive. but we dont know exactly what that number is. We can only wish for that amount. The cost of a 51% attack on Bitcoin is about 2 times higher.',\n",
       " ' The market value of all ASIS used to exploit BTC is about 6 billion USD. Currently (in the market price down). energy costs for a one -month attack will be about 1 billion USD. To compare. the US defense budget for 2023 was 816 billion USD. In terms of money. the US may need about 1% of defense budget and have enough money to attack any blockchain network. Suppose that no one is willing to risk losing billions of dollars for the Blockchain network attacks. there are many cheaper ways to carry out a 51% attack without having to own resources. The attacker has other options to get resources. an attacker may try to convince those authorized to authorize their pool. The owner of the resource may authorize ADA or the ratio of hash for a group of attackers without doubt that the authorized power will be abused for a attack at some time in the future. Or the attacker may also try to convince the operating operators of the attack in the attack. But this type of attack requires a large number of mobilization and may not be completely free. The attacker must set up a pool (or some pool) and somehow persuade the authorized people to authorize him. In order to increase the attractiveness of his illicit business. the attacker must give some additional rewards to the authorized person. the attacker will have to award higher rewards than what the protocol offers. They will have to provide Stake + some tokens or other stablecoins. The attacker will have to bribe the authorized people and hope to have the necessary number of stakes. The second option is no charge. This will not help the attacker in the case of Cardano. because there have been pools with a deposit fee of zero (however. operators receive a fixed fee. currently 340 ada each Epoch). the staker authorizes these pools because they want to support a specific pool operator for his work to the community. In Bitcoin ecosystem. miners are forced to reduce costs. The existence of no pools will be very attractive. And such pools exist. Two groups of dominance in the Bitcoin Blockchain network are now Foundry USA (accounting for 39% of the hash rates) and Antpool (accounting for 24% of the hash rates). The Minner wants to authorize these pools because it increases their profits. The attacker can try to compete with these large groups by providing extra miners to something. such as a reward for regular loyalty. this may be expensive and there is still a risk of an attacker who will not receive all the authorized hash rates. This type of attack can be done but there is a big drawback. The owner of the resource may change authority at any time. thus weakening the attacker. the authorization change is reflected almost immediately. With Cardano. the change will be effective with the latency (Cardano accepts changes in shares through SnapShot every 5 days). so the damage causes can be higher.',\n",
       " ' the attacker may try to censors the authorization change transactions. I think this attack is only theoretical and it is difficult to do in the real world. The diversity of relatively high staker and many of them will be cautious or doubtful before the offer is too attractive. The attacker can receive 10%. maybe 20%. but after that many members of the community will be alert and start warning the risk staker. The attacker can perform a Sybil attack. which is running multiple pools (or having multiple MPOs - Da Pool in Cardano). This attack will be more complicated but still difficult because new pool operators are hard to get stakes. So what to do to persuade the operators to work in attacking?. Pool operations have an economic engine to run a fair business. but the attacker may try to bribe them to cooperate in an attack. It is difficult to estimate the amount of money bribes and each person has a different threshold they are ready to betray the ecosystem. Suppose that a hundred times the annual bribe (profit gained from the Pool operation) will convince a significant number of pool operators. the attacker will have to convince dozens of different pool operators (depending on their stake). Suppose is 50 pool. He may have to give each person 5 million USD. The attacker will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on such an attack. less than the attack by buying ADA. The question is whether it is possible to find and contact all the operations of the exploitation pool and make sure they do not disclose the offer to the public or not. The more people need to contact. the more complicated attacks. High decentralization is a good way to prevent this type of attack. the attacker will have at least one Pool operator who dominates themselves or both (they work together to have more than 62% of the hash ratio). Their groups have no waste. so we dont know why they are doing business and their true profits. Will the Pool operate dominated in the Bitcoin network with cheap bribes like pool operators in Cardano network when they have such a large market share? We dont know. but maybe they will ask for a higher bribe. If you cant deceive people through social techniques. what about stealing their resources?. This may be the cheapest attack plan for the attacker. it is very difficult. ADA may be stolen from centralized exchanges. it is possible to bribe the CEO of the trading floor to allow theft. the attacker can get a few percent (can be up to several dozen percent) ADA from the total circulation. For a trading floor. a big hack always means losing its reputation. so the amount of bribes will have to be very high. Hacking a trading floor is a cheap choice but it requires a hacker or internal trading floor. You may try to steal ADA from the Stakes wallet and the Pool operator. but if they use the hardware wallet (a necessary security measure for the pool operator).',\n",
       " ' it is almost impossible. a hacker must attack a large number of individuals. Can 10% of ADA steal this way? It seems to me. Can the ratio of hash (hash rate) be stolen? Temporarily may be there. but cannot be stolen forever like Ada. A hacker can break into the computer of the company exploiting and redirect the hash rate to another group. the companys employees may soon avoid the attack thanks to the direct intervention of their system. it can be imagined that such an attack will be done simultaneously in a number of mining companies and may temporarily collect larger amounts of hash from the attacker. the current weakness is that there are 2 major exploitation groups dominated. If it is possible to penetrate their activities (eliminating in a short time or abuse of work to miners). the attacker will be able to temporarily gain control of the network. The operator may not react to an immediate attack and may take some time to find out what is actually happening. Can ASIC exploitation machines be confiscated or stolen? It is almost impossible to steal a large number of ASIC operating machines in such quantities to gain significant control of the network. confiscation is possible. In the history of Bitcoin. the Government has confiscated a large number of ASIC mining machines. the government does not use them to attack Bitcoin or to do business but let them be destroyed. Miners may be political attack. by high taxpayer for electricity consumption to exploit BTC. Such tax proposal has been considered in the US. Because POW uses physical resources and the exploitation is largely concentrated. it is easy to find the places where exploitation is taking place. Mining companies are mostly registered with that countrys government. Large miners can easily be traced. unlike the stake people can be anonymous. If the attacker wants to use force to gain control of his life. he can start destroying large exploitation rooms. doing so is a crime and I dont think anyone can do it. The anonymous of Stake and the fact that money is just a virtual currency is an advantage from this point of view. For bribes to cooperate (or forced to cooperate by blackmailing). the attacker easily finds the right candidate among the miners. If the attacker stole ADA. he would win the amount of Stake in Cardano network forever. The ratio of hash is harder to steal (and almost impossible). but may temporarily change its direction or cut the exploitation tool from the pool. finding Stake (as well as Spo) may be difficult compared to finding a miner. The attacker can easily monitor miners. The best way to defend against the attack vectors is described? The answer is almost always a high decentralization and there is no resource accumulation in one place. A decentralization is not having any error in the network. concentration often happens and this will become bile jars for attackers. The complexity of the attack increases as the number of factors must be deceived or persuaded to increase cooperation.',\n",
       " ' the gradual concentration occurs with most blockchains will weaken the security of that network itself. All current blockchain networks have weaknesses. The attacker has time. can combine many different forms of attacks and wait for the appropriate opportunity to attack. at the bottom of the market price. when the market capitalization of the projects is generally the lowest and the attacks are often cheaper. I dont think we will see these types of attacks in reality at a scale that makes the network risk. Blockchains economic and social importance is still not high enough for someone to carry out an attack with a large enough capital. Governments do not need to attack Blockchain through an expensive resource that (with cheap) through the people involved in operating the network. I am optimistic and think that governments will accept the existence of blockchain technology and will not attack it.October 13. Cardano has a natural liquidity stake attribute. Ouroboros POS does not require a token lock for a certain period of time and does not allow the confiscation of the token (Slashed) for the act behavior of the Stake who does not suit the needs of the protocol (such as Ethereum). we will explain how this can be done. We will also talk about the benefits of slashing and whether it makes Ethereum safer or. This means that ADA has a high liquidity during Stake so they can be spent at any time. Cardano adds another important feature for the liquidity stake. which does not require any minimum number of tokens to stake. The Cardano protocol does not lock the ADA. does not fined (Slash) for dishonest acts and does not require any minimum amount of money to start Stake. The goal of these attributes is to adjust the benefits of users in accordance with the benefits of the protocol. The decentralization and security of the cardano protocol based on the ADA distribution between users and their market prices. Cardano has a very simple way of Stake. which can be said to have almost no obstacles. because this increases its decentralization. What do users want? In a decentralized context. they want to control their property (do without a third party) and the ability to spend property at any time (liquidity). The reason why Cardano does not need a punishment (a mechanism used by some blockchain networks to punish malicious people) is the scientific work behind its attitude of Stake Ouroboros evidence. The team was inspired by the theory of Nash balance and combined it into the reward mechanism. The protocol encourages the reasonable behavior of the participants but of course it cannot completely prevent wrongdoing. a non -pure participant will need to hold more than 50% of ADA to get the dominance in the consensus of the network. Some POS projects. have a token lock mechanism to punish wrongdoing. the act of going against the protocol requirements. Ethereum authentication needs to lock 32 ETH on Blockchain to become an authentic person. This ETH Stake represents their stake in the network and is used as collateral to ensure they act honestly.',\n",
       " ' Locked ETH may be at risk of fines. this is a penalty that is enforced at a protocol level related to network errors or authentication. Slashing is designed to prevent the behavior of bad guys on the blockchain. ETH may be confiscated if the authentic person has the act of proposing a conflict. two -block authentication with the same goal in the same epoch. the Ethereum group has set the networks request too far from the needs of users. over time. it is clear that decentralization will be affected. Users who do not have enough 32 ETH will be forced to use third -party services. they abandoned their original ETH to get other derivative tokens only the market price is nearly the same. But those who have enough ETH to run the authentic process are not interested or technical skills needed to be able to adventure their own authentication. For any decentralized network. it is generally true that when decreasing decreases. the security also decreases. With the increasing number of single -point errors. the risk of abuse of power or errors affects a large amount of stake money. Accumulating large amounts of stake in some places can cause security risks. Cardano has its own mechanism (at the protocol level) to authorize any ADA number for the pool. This is divided into stakeholders into people who want to run pool (block production nodes) and those who just want to authorize ADA. It is important that the authorized people can always have ADA in their own wallets and are continuous positive agents. In the Ethereum network. the liquidity stake is performed through third parties like Lido. Lido will allow people to exchange ETH for the Steth Derigo token. Lido will then use the original ETH to stake. Lido Dao is responsible for selecting node operators. Steth are liquidity tokens that can be used at any time or used in DEFI. The problem is that the previous owners of ETH (most) are passive people in consensus and not holding the network in hand as the case of Cardano. Stake Ada may change the authorization for another pool at any time. thereby actively participating in the quality of block production. Stake people receive regular rewards directly from the protocol (no need for any three -side side). The original liquidity Stake has the advantage of eliminating third parties and leaving control of the ADA owner. Cardano could not prevent bad behavior because it did not have the mechanism to punish that behavior by confiscating tokens. So the question is whether the punishment mechanism is necessary or not?. Nash balance is an important concept in the game theory to provide solutions for non -cooperative games with the participation of at least two or more players. In the context of Cardanos reward plan and consensus. the Nash equilibrium state is used to analyze the behavior of the parties involved in the network. In the Nash equilibrium state. each player is considered to know the strategy of all other players and no players achieve anything if they only change their own strategy.',\n",
       " ' If there is a strategic set with characteristics that no player can benefit by changing their strategy while other players keep their strategy. then that strategy collection and the corresponding result will form a Nash equilibrium state. Nash balance theory is applied to Cardanos reward diagram. It can be said that the system reaches the Nash equilibrium state when all parties have decided their strategy. This means that all pool operations and delegates chose the best strategy for them to participate in the consensus of the network and have no motivation to go away from that strategy. Note that a large number of independent parties involved in equilibrium. It helps ensure that the system is fair and encourages reasonable behavior. there are a large number of stake people with different number of ada. Despite its high diversity. it can be assumed that most will choose a very similar strategy. Consider the two related parties can choose their Stake Ada or not. The reward for Stake will be higher than not Stake. assuming all the factors are acting honestly. If both sides involved their Stake Ada. both of them receive rewards. If a stake has no stake. the Stake will receive a reward while the other person does not receive anything. If not stake. then do not receive the reward. The Nash equilibrium state here is for both sides involved in their Stake Ada. This is because Stake is more profitable than not Stake. so no participants can gain benefits by unilaterally changing their strategy. ADA authorization for Pool (ie Stake Ada) is a strategy that benefits all Stake people. This strategy is not only related to whether or not to stake or not Stake (because the choice is obvious) but also related to the selection of any pool. The authorized person must choose a pool that gives them the highest reward possible. This is the only pool often creating blocks in each epoch. the pool must have a certain amount of money. the pool is not too saturated because this reduces the reward. Consider two Pool operators that can choose honest or dishonest actions. If both act honestly. both of them received rewards. If a person acts dishonestly and the other person is honest. the honest pool operator will receive a reward while the non -honest pool operator does not receive anything. Cardano did not pay rewards for dishonesty. If both of them act honestly. both of them will not receive a reward. Nash balance in this case is for both people to act honestly. Honest acts bring rewards. Operators are interested in their pool saturated. so they want to attract a large number of delegates (to saturation). this forced them to behave honestly. because only this behavior attracts the authorized people and ensures the reward not only for them but also for the Stake. The benefits of pool operations and stake are linked. It is possible to assume that ADA holders will behave appropriately when they want to receive Stake rewards.',\n",
       " ' The best strategy for the authorized person is to choose an effective and honest pool (no slot missing. The operating operator has costs related to the operation of the pool. so it can be assumed that they will behave appropriately to receive the reward (and cover the cost). They will try to create as many blocks as possible to receive the reward and attract as many delegates as possible. most Stake will represent the parties involved in honest. Cardano does not have a slashing. so the attacker does not lose Ada. he has a stake if he has a malicious action. The only penalty is that they do not receive potential rewards. The security of the Cardano network is based on the assumption that most of the stakeholders will behave honestly because they are encouraged by the reward system to do so. This is a common assumption in many blockchain protocols and I believe it is a reasonable assumption. because the parties have financial benefits for health and success of the network. It is important to note that although Cardano encourages economic behavior. it cannot completely prevent malicious behavior. An unreasonable participant will need to hold more than 50% of ADA to get the dominance in the consensus of the network. One of the security assumptions is that an individual almost cannot get such a large amount of money. with the increasing application and the number of participants. this can become an increasingly complex task. if someone successfully performed a 51%attack. Cardano did not have a defensive mechanism to confiscate the ADA number of the attacker. Ethereums fine mechanism is an important part of its security model. especially in protecting the 51% attack (in the case of Ethereum. this ratio is only 33. 3% higher). In order for the attacker to successfully carry out the attack. they will need to control more than 33. 3% of the networks stake power. when they continue to act maliciously. their ethn stake will be fined. reducing their stake strength. this will exhaust their resources and make them increasingly difficult to maintain their lives. This acts as a strong blocking for any attacker. Security is a complicated topic. We will only focus on part and that is to compare the liquidity stake with the ability to fined. If you want to compare the security of two blockchain. you will have to comprehensively analyze in every aspect. the ability to punish attackers is advantageous. this advantage will only be shown in the case of an attack that it is very difficult to do in reality. it cannot be excluded. Although Ethereum can punish attackers and consume them by hitting economic factors. ETH has no liquidity during Stake. This forces users to hand ETH to third parties on behalf of them. This basically reduces decline. thus reduces security. Due to an unlikely attack. the concentration occurs in the Ethereum ecosystem. Paradoxically. the attack becomes more realistic along with the unwanted impact on the consensus of third parties exactly due to some high ETH accumulation entity.',\n",
       " ' poor liquidity stake reduces security. If the existence of the defensive mechanism reduces decline and security. the design can be considered as the design below the optimal level. Lidos Stake ratio reaches more than 32% ETH. The 3 largest centralized exchanges also account for more than 20% of ETH. If an entity controls a large part of the ETH. it may have an unbalanced effect on the network. This goes against the decentralized principle. which is a major feature of the Blockchain network. There is no such high stake concentration in Cardano ecosystem. The largest multi -pool operator in Cardano ecosystem has a market share of only 7. There are only two centralized exchanges in the top 10 with a total market share of 6. Stake liquidate is decentralized and thus increases security. The distribution of many ADA tokens into the hands of a large number of Stake and Pool operators is a great protection measure against attacks. including 51%attack. Attacking a power center (maybe a smart contract or centralized exchange) is always easier than a large number of stakeholders. Stake decentralization is very important for other reasons other than attacking. A decentralization is very important from the view against different types of errors. such as the error in the smart contract. the abuse of the power of the CEO of the exchange. Ethereum has the advantage that the authentication process is at risk of penalties. such as if they propose conflict blocks or if the authentication process does not work. Cardano does not have the mechanism of punishing the inactive node or the case of Slot Leader deliberately adds one block to the existing two strings in the case of branching. A attack can be taken when the attacker set up his own pool. filling it with his own ADA and deliberately not casting. There will be fewer blocks that are cast in Cardano. which will affect overall performance. The attacker will not be fined for this attack and we can continue to attack forever (but node must renew the certificate regularly). as far as I know. this type of attack has not happened in the Cardano ecosystem. Cardano has POS with Stake feature for the third consecutive year and so far involved parties seem to be behaving properly. The saturated pool operator has the following two options. Pool operators can cast blocks and receive about 1.000 ADA tokens every 5 days (depending on the fee). or not cast and not receive a reward. If Cardano has some forms of fines. it should only be applied to the ADA token of the pool operators themselves. The authors ada will remain liquid. Cardano is confidential. largely supported by the liquidity Stake. Stake liquidity allows decentralized growth. Small stakes. like whales. can keep ADA in their cardano wallets and entrust money for any pool. The reasonable choice of the Stake is a pool that the pool operator also behaves properly. In case of problem. the representative can always choose another pool.',\n",
       " ' Ethereum is also a safe blockchain. although for me it seems to be more focused. Vitalik Buterin. development group. Ethereum Foundation and some leading members of the LIDO community (and other similar agents) are a major threat and intention to solve this problem. From Vitaliks last article. I felt that he was inspired by Cardano and wanted ETH holders to choose Node operator. The liquidity stake has another advantage. If Crypto becomes money in the future. their attributes must be appropriate. Besides becoming a good value storage place. it can also be said to become an exchange. ADA may be money because they retain liquidity during Stake. Ada holders have a security network in their hands. but they can spend (and get back). This is not the same as the case of Ethereum. If the ETH Stake holders on a centralized trading floor. they cannot spend their own money. If they stake with Lido. they will receive steth tokens for ETH. Can stethia (and similar tokens) be money? It is difficult to say this. Steth may have a market price similar to ETH. but they have no meaning from the network consensus (except for ETH that can be regained). I dare to say that the liquidity stake is necessary from this point of view.October 9. we will describe the operation of the UTXO ledger model. which is similar to the paper money (Cash). We have refined this article to make it simpler. When we use a bank account. we often care about the balance. The balance is an increase when someone deposits money into an account or decreases if the account holder spends money. Accounting -based ledger model that Ethereum uses the same operation in this way. If Alice has 3 ETH in his account and sends to BOB 1 ETH. Ethereum transactions will deduct 1 ETH from Alices account and add to the BOB account. Ethereum transactions are an atomic operation. This means it happens at a time and creates a change in the state through the blocks. unlike the bank account balance. The UTXO model works completely different in nature. although the user will not notice it thanks to Cardanos Wallet (Wallet). The UTXO model does not use concepts like accounts and balances. Utxo works the same way that paper money is more active. And a UTXO can carry any nominal value. A UTXO can be worth 6. 9 ADA. 47 ADA or 459. 7 ADA. Cardano wallet will help users add value to all UTXOs in a wallet and display the general information as the account balance. With 3 UTXOs in the wallet as mentioned in the previous example. Alice saw in her wallet of a total of 513. 6 ADA. What happens if Alice wants to send BOB 50 ADA?. Alice will create a transaction in Cardano wallet. In addition to the recipient address of Bob. she also entered the amount to be transferred to 50 ADA. If the wallet needs to be inserted into the transaction.',\n",
       " ' this transaction will have a total of 50 ADA plus 0. 17 ADA for fee. The wallet can use a single input UTXO worth 459. 7 ADA or can use two input UTXOs with 6. 9 ADA and 47 ADA as input for transactions to be made. If the wallet selects the second option. A total of 53. 9 ADA is used as an input for transactions. Cardano transactions specify the input UTXO (or inputs) and output UTXO (or outputs). The total value of inputs must be equal to or greater than the total value of the output. Each input UTXO can only be used once. meaning it can only be used as an input for a transaction. After UTXO is used as input. the total amount of that UTXO will be used once. Many newer UTXOs will usually be created and that will be the output of the transaction> These outputs can be used as input for future transactions. Note that the transaction input is the number of ADA larger than the amount of Alice wants to send to BOB (including fee). This is consistent with the operation of the UTXO model. Through the transaction. Alice spent 50. so through the newly created UTXO. 73 ADA will be returned to her account. The transaction will have 2 output UTXOs. 50 ADA for Bob and 3. 73 ADA for Alice. you can see the transaction described. Both input UTXO will be completely used and the output UTXO will be created from them. The value of the output UTXO will be lower than the transaction fee. Bob received exactly 50 ADA. This fee is not a new UTXO but the difference between the total input value and the total output value. The fee is paid to the network to process and verify the transaction. The transaction fee is recorded as an account -based model. as it is deducted from the depositors balance and is added to the balance of the network without creating a new output. unlike an account -based model. the fee is not clearly indicated in the transaction but is underground calculated. Utxo works the same as when paying with paper money at the cash register in the store. If you have to pay $ 36. you can pay in $ 50 sheet and cashier will return you $ 14. Or you can use two $ 20 sheets and the cashier will return you 4 dollars. If you pay the exact number of $ 20 goods. you can pay in $ 20 sheet and the cashier will not return you anything. with Cardano. you always have to pay transactions. Someone may find it helpful when comparing UTXO with the numbered vouchers on the blackboard. Spending means bricking the number on the existing vote and pasting new numbers in a new vote so that the value of the bricks and the number on the new vote is equal. Let me move to another short topic. It is good to understand the UTXO model in the context of 24 -hour network transmission value is reported.',\n",
       " ' In our example with Alice and Bob. only 50 ADAs were transferred between 2 participants. This is the amount to be reported. There are 3. 73 ADA that has been returned to Alices account and is not included in the report. Analysts will easily find out which output UTXO has moved to a new address (outside) and which address will return to the senders wallet. Stake key is often used to distinguish. It is impossible to put input UTXO as a report because Alices wallet may have used the input UTXO with a value of 1000 ADA (if it is not more suitable in the wallet). this will make a lot of reporting deviations. this can also happen if the analysts do not identify the correct UTXO that has moved to a new address (outside) and UTXO has returned a part of the deposits wallet. In the above explanation. we made some simplification to make it easier to understand. Please fix it a little. UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output (Output Output). UTXO is the output of the previous transaction. this transaction can be spent in the future. Input UTXO can be described simply as a structure including identification code and value. The identification code is called the starting point. The starting point acts as a cursor to the position of UTXO in the blockchain. it is reference to the previous trading output. The address of the current owner of the money is found in the previous transaction. UTXO input refers to the transaction that has created UTXO owned by the current spending person. The outpoint (Outpoint) of the input UTXO includes the transaction ID (Transaction ID) and the Output Index of the transaction that created UTXO. The output index refers to the position of the output in the transaction. The value (funds) is the number of coins or tokens that UTXO holds. You can see the input UTXO structure in the image below. The output UTXO in the previous transaction also contains the recipients address. which is the address of the current currency owner. You will do an example below. When the UTXO becomes the input of a new transaction. the new transaction will determine the output address (or addresses) will receive money from input. The output address can be the general address (signature request to unlock) or the address of the command (Redemer request to unlock). UTXO output also contains the recipients address. It is an outpoint to the recipient address. This link is not fixed because the recipients address can become a destination for another transaction in the future. UTXO is constantly consumed and created by online transactions. When a new transaction is created. each input address must be provided with a witness (witness). The starting point is the link between the owners address and the UTXO. as it determines the output of which transaction that UTXO belongs to. Cardano transaction is a structure of four main components: input. output. fee and witness (input. witness). Each output contains an important auxiliary component.',\n",
       " ' which is the recipients address. you can see the structure of the output UTXO in the transaction. creating the output UTXO (new UTXO). Note that it contains the address of the recipient. you can see Alices trading again. Note that the addresses that ADA is spent is not part of the transaction. Transactions only refer to the address through the outpoint (green arrow). Alice must prove that the address is her and she has the right to spend ADA. There is a witness (red arrow) in trading for each address in cash. There are 2 outputs in the transaction with index 0 and 1. Each index contains a UTXO. also includes the recipients address. The output has a 0 containing UTXO with 50 ADA and the recipient address belongs to BOB. The output has an index 1 containing UTXO with 3. 73 ADA and the recipient address belongs to Alice. The blue arrow indicates the location in the blockchain where the UTXO is located. where the address of the money owner will be found when a new UTXO) when a new transaction is created to spend them. When people present to UTXO. it is usually simplified. Utxo is only considered as the value kept at the owners address and can be used. Spending means converting value from the senders address to the recipients address. Basically this describes what is really happening. It is important to realize that through transactions. the inputs will be canceled and newly created UTXOs. Newly created UTXOs can become input (input UTXO) of new transactions. Trading history is still stored in Blockchain. Each UTXO can only be used once. And. the entire value of UTXO has been used. The nodes maintain a collection of all unused (active) UTXOs that can be used. With each new block added to the blockchain. the collection of UTXO will change. you can see how UTXO disappears and how new UTXO is created. Activities include UTXO from transactions 5. 8 and 9. Utxo from transactions 1. 3 and 4 will be permanently used (canceled). To spend UTXO in transaction 9. Blockchain needs to verify the signature of the owner. Utxo input in transaction 9 refers to the recipients address (is the address of the current owner) in transaction 4. Signature (witness) in transaction 9 is verified based on the address in UTXO output from transaction 4. If the transaction passes the authentication process and is put into the blockchain through a new block. the owner of the output UTXO in transaction 9 can spend money in the future. In the process of destroying and creating UTXO. not arbitrarily creating new funds. In our example. the value in the input UTXO from transaction 1 is equal to the sum of all values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bfrom the UTXO belongs to the activity group (all UTXOs can be spent). If we miss the fee. it is true that the value of the input in the transaction must correspond to the value of the output. the value of the input UTXO is 100 coins in transaction 1.',\n",
       " ' This value is equal to the value of all outputs in the active UTXO set. 100 = 8 + 2 + 15 + 5 + 18 + 12 + 3 + 7 + 23 + 7. The UTXO model may be more complicated than an account -based model. This is also true for applied programmers who may feel more difficult to work with this model because they do not work with balance (such as the Accounting model) and work with UTXO. Despite the higher complexity. the UTXO model has some advantages. mainly in the context of use in dispersed networks. We will talk more about that in the next article.October 8. The focus of all blockchain communities is essential tools to participate and give financial rights. one of the tools acting as the gateway and spine of the ecosystem - allowing users to store. transfer and stake their property. There are many wallets for cardano users. each wallet has different features. advantages and limitations. we will learn deeply about Eternl. one of the common wallets for users in the Cardano community. Eternl is a light cardano wallet launched in May 2021 by CcVault. a company that provides safe and user -friendly crypto solutions. Since its inception. Eternls mission has become one of the main cardano wallets by deploying features required by the Cardano community. The group behind Stake Pool Titan and AHL has developed and maintained Eternl wallets. supporting more than 100.000 users operate weekly. Eternl is an open source project that completely welcomes the contributions of developers and users feedback. Eternl is available in the form of web applications. mobile applications (iOS and Android) and extended browser utilities (Chrome. Edge. Brave and Opera). Users can access their wallets from any device and synchronize their data on the platforms. As a lightweight wallet. Eternl does not ask to download the entire blockchain. but instead connect to a remote node. The wallet supports and receives ADA as well as the original token. authorized ADA for Stake Pool. Through expanded browser and mobile application. users can connect to Dapps (decentralized application). allowing them to interact with smart contracts and other features on Cardano network. Eternl wallet provides many features and capabilities. To use Eternl. users can access it via a web browser or download expanded browser or mobile application. Users can choose from the list of existing wallets or create a new wallet by entering the name and password. Users can also enter existing wallet by providing recovery phrases. Here are the steps to use Eternl wallet:. Using Eternl is very simple and intuitive. Users can create new wallets or restore existing wallets with a phrase restoring 24 words. They can also enter or export their wallet data in the form of a JSON file for backup or move purposes. After the wallet is established. users can view the balance. trading history and the list of their assets on the overview page. They can also send. receive and exchange ADA. NFT (unable to replace tokens) and other original tokens on Cardano network.',\n",
       " ' Eternl supports QR code. address book and custom fees for transactions. Users can also Stake Ada in the group they choose and earn reward for network security. Eternl provides information about different Stake Pool. such as their performance. commitments and social media links. Users can authorize their ADA to any group with just a few clicks and change their authorization at any time. For more detailed instructions. you can follow this video tutorial of Casually Cardano:. Eternl is one of many cardano wallets available on the market. but how does it compare with other popular cardano wallets? This section compares Eternl with other popular cardano wallets:. Eternl compared to Daedalus: Daedalus is the official node wallet that supports ADA. original token. Stake and Dapps. This is a desktop application that requires users to download the entire blockchain. Daedalus was developed by IOHK. another founding unit of Cardano. Daedalus has more features than Eternl such as multi -signature transactions. smart contracts and voting registration. Daedalus may be less convenient than Eternl for some users. especially those who want a mobile and fast wallet. Eternl compared to Yoroi: Yoroi is another lightweight wallet that supports ADA. It also has an extended browser and mobile application. Yoroi was developed by Emurgo. one of Cardanos founding units. Yoroi has more features than Eternl. such as integrated hardware wallet. managing multiple accounts and creating custom tokens. Yoroi may be less user -friendly than Eternl for some users. especially beginners. Eternl compared to Nami: Nami is another lightweight wallet that supports ADA. original tokens. It is an extended browser utility that allows users to access Dapps from any website. Nami was developed by Berry Pool. Spos Cardano. Nami has similar features to Eternl but does not have an independent web wallet. DAPPS browser or mobile application. Nami may be more compatible than Eternl with some Dapps. especially DAPPS using Plutus smart contracts. Although Eternl is faster. lighter and more convenient to use. it also has some limitations. Eternl wallets have performed important updates on its features and functions over the past months. In Catalyst Fund 10 recently closed. the core development group of Eternl has sent the proposal to help them operate the custom server infrastructure. efficient and reliable for the wallet. Their proposal has succeeded and received an overwhelming number of votes from the community. The plan is expected to receive 553.800 ADA. this amount will help them maintain high -performance wallets with minimum stopping time and maximum use for users around the globe. The funding also comes at an important time when the Eternl group is trying to improve the wallet experience with the release of the upcoming V2 wallet. The previous releases. especially the notable V1. 11 version. have a solid foundation for the design and release of V2 with a significant overhaul including smart chain. reducing memory use. fast synchronization and more compact database. If you want to know more about the updates and notes of Eternls release. please see their news.',\n",
       " ' With the community -based approach to developing and deploying features. Eternl is definitely one of the most promising wallets for Cardano users. You can find out more and update information about Eternl by viewing its official homepage and proposing their Eternl on X (formerly Twitter.October 7. Cardano allows you to send more assets to many recipients in a transaction. The term transactions in transactions are sometimes not suitable when used for this feature. Explain the transactions in the network using the UTXO accounting model different from the transactions in the network using an account -based model. You will also find out why TPS data is not suitable for Cardano. but it is okay to use it for Ethereum. Cardano uses UTXO accounting model (unpaid trading output). UTXO represents a certain number and type of asset. Each transaction uses a number of UTXO from previous transactions (UTXO is the input of the transaction) and creates new UTXOs that can be used as input for future transactions. In the context of the transaction. we can call it the input UTXO and the output UTXO or simply use the term input and output. This is similar. Cardano transactions change the owner of UTXO. Utxo has the address that does not own it and can spend it. Trading output (UTXO) has a new address that belongs to the recipient. Transfer of UTXO ownership from the sender to the recipient. A transaction may have many inputs and outputs. and each output may have a different value and type of asset. Each output can be sent to a different recipient. The overall state of Cardano (ie the users wallet balance) is not used with accounts or wallets in the ledger context. The state of using only UTXO. is a collection of all trading outputs that have not been spent online. The UTXO set shows the current allocation of assets among cardano users. What is the benefits of the UTXO model for expansion?. The ability to send more content to many people receives reduces the size of transactions (and thus reducing fees). this is beneficial for expansion. This allows more transactions to fit a block. The verification process is very simple and effective. because the network only needs to check if the input of the transaction is a valid UTXO from previous transactions or not and the total value of the input is equal to or greater than the total value of the output. The network does not need to track the balance of each account or perform any complex logic related to smart contracts. like Ethereum (we will talk more about this later). Cardano does not follow each account (Cardano tracks each UTXO). Each UTXO can be verified independently of other UTXOs. as long as they are not spent on the same transaction. It is similar in case of confirmation of the instruction. The verification of commands always refers to a single UTXO. The UTXO model allows parallel handling of transactions not to share any input.',\n",
       " ' which can improve expansion and ventilation. this also requires a consensus protocol that can handle simultaneous transactions and resolve conflicts. It can be said that the cardano transactions in parallel in the sense that they can serve many people receiving with different assets in a transaction. Many people participate in the network for a single authentication. The authentication with many participants of course requires more computer resources. it will be less demanding than creating separate transactions for the same number of recipients. Lets take a look at the account based on the account that Ethereum uses. It is important to understand the global general state and how Ethereum works with the user balance. with accounts. The global state of Ethereum is the current state of all accounts (user balance) and online contracts. Each Ethereum account has an ETH balance and other tokens. The global general state of Ethereum is necessary to lock in the process of processing all transactions because it requires (almost mandatory) to execute the code. The transaction simply converts value from one account to another. so they only update the user balance. a deduction of 10 tokens from Alices account and add them to BOBs account. ERC-20 token is determined by smart contracts that implement the standard interface to transfer and token balance. ERC-20 tokens cannot be transferred without using smart contracts. There are two types of transactions in Ethereum: Transfer of value and smart contract transactions. Transfer transactions can only transfer ETH. not other tokens. It can only have one sender and one recipient. Ethereum can send a lot of assets in a transaction. but only when the transaction is related to the performance of smart contracts. Smart contracts may also be logical to transfer these tokens to different recipients. The fact that Ethereum sends many assets to many recipients is unusual compared to Cardano. the processing of transactions in Ethereum almost always requires the network to execute the code related to the transaction and update the status of each corresponding account. The status of each account includes (besides other things) the balance and number of nonce of that account. Nonce is a counting number of transactions that an account has sent. The global general state of Ethereum needs to be locked in this process because each transaction depends on the status of the senders account. which can change due to other transactions. if Alice sends a transaction to BOB with an Nonce number 1. then sends another transaction to Carol with the NONCE number 2. then the network needs to ensure that the first transaction is processed before the second transaction. otherwise. the result will be during the invalid state conversion process. The impact of the general state lock shared during the processing of each transaction is that it limits the ability to expand and clear the network. The common state lock is shared. which means that transactions have the same sender or the recipient must be processed in a sequential way. which can produce congestion and delay.',\n",
       " ' if Alice sends 10 transactions to different recipients in a short period of time. each transaction must wait for the previous transaction to be confirmed before it can be processed. This may increase the latency and cost of each transaction. The difference between the UTXO model and an account -based model is Cardano operating with independent UTXOs (allowing parallel). while Ethereum works with interdependent account balance (forced sequential handling). You may have understood that the term transaction in transactions basically refers to the ability to send many contents to many recipients in a transaction. In Ethereum term. we can say that a transaction will adjust a lot of balance. The design of accounting models has an impact not only to expand but also to measure the network through the network. TPS (Trading per second) is a measure of the number of transactions that the network can handle in a second. TPS can tell us how many people are using or can use the network at any time. TPS data assumes that a transaction will transfer the value between a sender and a recipient. it has a disadvantage. This assumption is not valid for the whole blockchain industry. TPS is often used to evaluate the performance and expansion capacity of the computer system. especially the large number of financial processing systems. such as payment systems. exchanges and banking. TPS is suitable for the mainstream financial systems because transactions often take place between two participants with a bank account. TPS data can be used in the blockchain industry. If we want to compare blockchain with different accounting models. this data is not suitable. For Ethereum. TPS data will be more suitable than Cardano. Although Ethereum can send many assets to many people in a transaction. this is not very popular. TPS therefore corresponds to reality although it may not be accurate. we can see complicated transactions that transfer many assets to many people receiving in almost any bloc. TPS data is not suitable and does not provide the exact number. In the past 24 hours. Cardano has processed 18.759 simple transactions and 30.481 transactions with Smart Contract (SC). transactions that are not scored can transfer many assets to many people. this is more common with SC transactions (usually with DEX applications). One of the recent cardano blocks has 32 transactions. TPS data reaches 1. if we check the bloc more closely. we will see that the number of recipients a total of 62. If adjusting TPS accordingly. we will have the number 3. There are a total of 189 utxo in the block. With Ethereum. a similar block with 32 transactions will most likely have 32 recipients. so 32 balances will be adjusted. If analysts want to measure Cardanos network through. they need to talk more carefully and consider the content of the transactions. The appropriate data will be the same as the required number per second or the number of recipients per second. it is necessary to realize that the blockchain can not be said to meet the function of a trading network like Paypal.',\n",
       " ' or rather a smart contract platform. may be like a main type of payment layer for higher layers or a basic layer. Property will be cast on a blockchain to protect their monetary policy. but users may use them in other networks. The future is uncertain about this issue. but it seems like that. Users use Cardano mainly through applications and evidence that the composition of transactions in the block. It is reasonable to have more requirements in the transaction because it saves the field in the bloc and users save money.October 5. Blockchain economics are easy to understand if you see it as a business activity. Blockchain needs to operate and have enough income to cover those expenses. blockchain needs users to pay transaction fees. we will show which market mechanisms will affect the success of Cardano. this is applied to all blockchains. When Bitcoin is created. anyone can exploit BTC on their computer. the operators do not receive free money but to receive resources they provide to Bitcoin. It was exactly a group of volunteers who provide the necessary resources for the blockchain to receive financial rewards. It can be said that volunteers work for the network to receive rewards in the form of crypto. They pay for the expenses related to the operation of the network and they will only do this if the activity will still bring profits to them. This means that their income must be higher than the cost. See where the cost comes from. Blockchain network is subject to costs from calculated resources. such as electricity. hardware and bandwidth. These resources are used to handle transactions. perform smart contracts. ensure the integrity and immutability of the ledger through the consensus of the network. The cost of these resources depends on the design of the consensus mechanism. the number of network users and services that people use. The more people use the network. the higher the operating cost. Human resources also need to be added to the cost. For example: In Cardano network. there may be hundreds of Pool operators investing a large amount of time in operating the pool. Bitcoin mining companies are traded by a few hundred employees (the largest is Canaan with 540 employees). These are also the costs paid by the blockchain network. Where does the money come from to cover the cost of blockchain?. including Cardano and Bitcoin. have a limit on the amount of money that will be issued in circulation. Cardano has a reserve from which the new Ada tokens are released every 5 days will be used to stake rewards. Bitcoin does something similar to all exploited blocks. The reserve is decreasing in both cases and tends to be close to 0. For long -term economic sustainability. blockchain needs revenue. Users pay transaction fees. in the long term this is the only source of income for blockchain. Some projects may have infinite token inflation. which can bring income. but it reduces the scarcity of tokens because the amount of money circulating is constantly increasing.',\n",
       " ' Because we do not have a long enough experience with blockchain. we do not know if it is better if we have more money with lower market prices or less money with higher market prices. The market price is not only affected by the scarcity but mainly due to demand. The network cost. which the current blockchain is mostly paid in reserves. must gradually be replaced by transaction fees from users. If this does not happen. blockchain will have nothing to cover its operating costs. The important functions and attributes of the blockchain will be impaired. which can lead to their gradual collapse. Blockchain has some economic aspects that can be analyzed using concepts of revenue. users and employees. See what Blockchain needs to exist in the decades until they cannot rely on reserves. The cash flow in the Blockchain can be defined as the difference between the total cash flow and the cash flow of a crypto in a period of time for a certain network participant. the cash flow of the bitcoin miner can be calculated by deducting electricity and hardware from the revenue of the block reward. the same thing can be done by deducting the cost of operating the pool from the Stake reward. The Stake Ada has an almost zero cost. By authorizing ADA to select Pool. they participate in the decentralized and security process of the network. they guarantee an important attribute of the network to deserve the reward. Stake rewards are basically a profit for them. It is important to realize that participants are not only people but above all the blockchain. Blockchain provides services to users and they pay them. Blockchain protocols produce income and pay rewards. The cash flow in the blockchain can be used to measure the profit and sustainability of the operations of the network as well as the blockchain itself. if individual participants are not profitable in the long run. the network cannot provide quality services. If the network does not provide quality services. it cannot earn transaction fees. Do you see the cycle in this?. The user fee is distributed by volunteers to the network and provides resources for the network. The more the network is collected. the more rewards. This increases the hash ratio for Bitcoin (higher security) or Stake rewards in the case of Cardano. In terms of cost and revenue. blockchain operates similar to a business. Blockchain must be attractive. effective and useful for everyone. Utilities make profits. Profits determine success and ensure longevity. Blockchain can only cover the cost if it earns money from it. This is one of the basic principles. Utilities -> profit -> life expectancy. Only successful blockchain. people will actively use. lasting for a long time. What do people find in the context of blockchain? It is mainly based on decentralized characteristics. global readiness. It can be said that success depends on the utility. Success = utility. The success of global companies is associated with the vast network effect.',\n",
       " ' The more people use a certain network or product. the more successful the company (and of course is also profitable). The achieving high network effect depends on the utility. Large network effects can be achieved through narrative or (and) technology dominance in a specific field. People tend to receive the best services with the lowest fee. It can be said that the utility originates from effectiveness. Utilities = report + Effective. we can measure the effectiveness through expansion. the blockchains differ in fast. safe. fee and above all the decentralized ability that they can handle transactions. Effective = expansion. there is a story associated with the belief that Blockchain will succeed in breaking money or financial services. Personally. I think it is two different things. Bitcoins mission is more related to the replacement of Fiat or gold currency. Smart contract platforms like Cardano are more about the decline of traditional financial services through DEFI. many people will argue that ADA can be considered similar to BTC. It is not very important for this article. On Blockchain technology. people attach great importance to decentralization. It can be said that these are utilities or provide utilities. Utility = decentralized + security + expansion + DEFI + token. What we do not know and what the community does not agree is the importance of personal utilities. Some people think that the most important thing is decentralization. Others say that it is security provided through POW. A decentralization and security are quite abstract concepts for the community that they do not understand very well. They feel the useful through the users direct experience. through transaction speed. fees and services (DEFI). Cryptos success will be mainly based on application and network effects. we do not even know for sure whether the dominant aspect is the story (valuable storage. breakthrough technology. ) or rather technology (transfer of value. anti -censorship. we know for sure that no blockchain will succeed if not applied. Success = Application + Network effect. It is important that people start to believe in the system. The interruption will only occur if people do not lose money on the DEFI and believe that this network is reliable and safe. The transaction must be resolved quickly and the fee cannot be too volatile. The longer the network lasts and the longer people use it. the more people will believe in it. The life expectancy is especially important for narrative articles. Faith = Security + Reliability + Life expectancy. Faith is very important for success. and we can expand the definition of success. Success = Utilities + Faith. we are mainly interested in the economic model of the Blockchain network. This is mainly related to the ability to create revenue. As we all know. revenue is associated with utilities. network effects and applications. as this offers transaction fees. It can also be said that profits come from success. Profit = Utilities + Faith. Just like for companies. Blockchain must have higher revenue than expenses. Revenue> = Costs.',\n",
       " ' If we ignore the reserve. it is true that the network will collect more transactions than the amount it pays as a reward. Transaction fee> = reward. If this turns this to what described above. we will find that the network will bring long -term profits. economic sustainability. if useful. people will trust and it will have a huge network effect. Utilities + beliefs + network effects> = reward. An interesting aspect is the network effect. This can be connected to the direct interaction between users online or with a story. The difference is the interaction through transactions is a service that blockchain earns. Stories will not provide energy for the blockchain network. but they can improve the market price of tokens. which can be temporarily helpful while the token is stored. Blockchain network will only exist if they (or pool) constantly reduce operating costs (this is a challenge. especially for the Proof-of-Work network) and provide attractive enough facilities for people to start using them on a large scale. In order for this to happen. blockchains need to expand the good scale from the beginning to make a fee. If there is a second layer (layer 2) in the ecosystem that people can move in. it may be a problem. Transaction fees will be transferred to the second class operators at blockchain costs. This can destroy the economic blockchain for a long time. In order for Cardano to exist for a long time. apply the following (ignoring the reserve and the Cardano budget). Transaction fee> = SPO expenses + Stake reward. it is similar. Transaction fee> = Costs of miners. Considering the cost -related cost of the privacy budget. it is like this (assuming the security costs do not need to be licensed to decrease). This time. it is necessary to have an additional reserve in the equation. Reserve + fee> = security budget. the design of the POW and POS networks is different. the reward will belong to the operators who are not the operators of the node (pool). Mainly hardware and electricity costs are included. It would be exaggerated to say that Bitcoin only paid for security. It may be difficult to ensure adequate number of nodes in the network with resources that can be used because there is no economic engine for this. Cardano pays operators to operate nodes (pool). people with resources can be used to transmit transactions (expansion ability) and execute smart contracts. Cardano paid for resources and decentralization. It is possible to encourage the addition of nodes to the network and use their resources to achieve higher expansion capacity. Privacy is largely guaranteed through the distribution of tokens (and stake rewards). Blockchain network needs to be applied practically. I am afraid that technology blockchain is not ready for this. Their expansion is very low. this also directly affects DEFI. Expensive. unreliable and above all. the hacks and frauds often make people not want to apply. If they do not apply the network. they will not receive a fee and without them.',\n",
       " ' they will disappear sooner or later. We still have time. because there is still enough money in the reserve. but we have to think about the fact that one day it is the main income will be the transaction fee that the operator and the Stake will be paid. In the next 10 years. it may achieve basic technology advances. which is essential for the success of Blockchain. Many people doubt the existence of the development group because they consider it a form of concentration. without the development group. every blockchain will no longer exist. in 2010 Satoshi saved Bitcoin from certain deaths. We will talk about what happened in the past and how to understand it in a decentralized context. This article is especially for newcomers who want to understand why management is an essential part of every blockchain and what form it can be. You will understand why Cardano is going in a decentralized manager and the ADA holders will have any position in the relationship with the group. Blockchain network should be decentralized. From the definition. we know that in a decentralized system. there is no agency or third party that has the right to make significantly higher decisions than others. In case of ideal (not in reality). all network participants must have the same state. We divide the blockchain decentralization into a block production group and project management group. Although today people know relatively much about the block production group. the management is still mysterious and mythical. Many people sometimes have misleading concepts about blockchain. They think it is just a network in which a few enthusiasts run node or pool to receive rewards. Users can freely use this network and enjoy all the benefits of decentralization. From the users point of view as well as from the viewpoint of the production of blocks. this is how it works. The other part of the fact is the people who run nodes basically only take over the software they run on their hardware. it is important to ask where the software comes from. who maintains it and how it is related to decentralization. People know that the software is mostly made by companies. Windows is developed by Microsoft and Facebook developed by Meta. These are mostly large companies worldwide. They are concentrated. they have CEOs and source codes closed (no one from the public can see it). It is reasonable when people think that there is no company with a CEO behind the blockchain. So the administration is not just a beautiful word that does not match the blockchain?. Some people see the administration negatively. as it always shows a certain level of concentration in a system that needs decentralization. At least that is what some people present. The fact is that the software development is always and to a certain extent will still focus. all software needs a development group. coordination. management and someone responsible for important decisions. Blockchain cannot exist without a certain team. There must always be people who are willing to solve urgent problems and think of increasing efficiency and ability to expand as well as improve and innovate.',\n",
       " ' Blockchain without a team will die. Dont you believe it? Come and let us see how Satoshi saved Bitcoin from death almost sure. Did you know that on August 15. an anonymous hacker almost destroyed Bitcoin? Hackers have created 184.467 billion BTC unexpectedly in what is called a value overflow. Satoshi Nakamoto quickly hardver blockchain to remove 184.467 billion BTC. It saved Bitcoin from early death that day. Satoshi Nakamoto created a code editor within 3 hours. Bitcoin developer initially Gavin Andresen worked with Satoshi to offer a quick solution. Within 5 hours after the incident. Satoshi released the version 0. 1 of Bitcoin. preventing future Bitcoin printing through this exploitation activity. This is a hardfork. Two different versions of Bitcoin existed immediately after the 0. 1 version was released. Satoshi calls for miners not to exploit bad chains because doing so will make the chain better take more time to become the dominant chain. Only 19 hours after the incident began. the good chain became the dominant chain. We will return to the story in the article. What did Satoshi do to save Bitcoin?. Satoshi and Gavin Andersen (developed group!) Had to find errors in the source code and fix it. they had to release a new version of the software (workstation). But it is not enough. People need to learn about errors and agree to fix errors. install the new version of the workstation app on their computer. Satoshi and Gavin had to inform everyone about this error and show them how to keep Bitcoin safely. It is necessary to convince most miners (more precisely to achieve superior hash ratio) so that the Bitcoin version has corrected the dominant error compared to the old version. The influence of power has been implemented. This is the first major blockchain problem that needs some forms of management to solve. These questions will be extremely important. Will Bitcoin exist today if Satoshi does not fix errors? What will happen if a similar error on the Bitcoin network happens next week? Do you think the form of management is necessary in this story?. Obviously without Satoshis intervention or anyone else. Bitcoin will not exist. This finding can be applied to every existing blockchain including cardano. Blockchain clearly needs a development team to be able to solve urgent problems. Any technology. even the best. can fail because its individual constituents can become outdated or the deployment environment can change. Or there may be significant competition and people switch to something new. it is necessary to think about the dominance of technology. Satoshi and Gavin were sometimes in a situation where they were not sure whether they could save Bitcoin. And this despite the fact that they have a new version of the Bitcoin workstation app that has been corrected. The development team must contact all those who are running well and convince them to deploy a new version. people do not need to agree. in the case of serious problems. everyone tends to cooperate.',\n",
       " ' sometimes it can be just a small upgrade. which can be controversial and the full node operators may have a different view of it. Some will install a new version and some will not. This form of management is still active in Bitcoin to this day and I hope you will not be surprised when it also works in the Cardano ecosystem. Bitcoin has a separate development group. I can even say that Bitcoin has several groups. Some of them are funded by the VC Fund. Cardano also has its own development group. which is the Output Global - IOG (formerly Input Output Honk Kong). The IOG group released new versions of Cardano workstation app and provided it to Pool (SPO) operators. The same workstation approaches people through Daedalus wallet. It is impossible to impose a workstation version to the pool operators in any way. The IOG group does not know the pool operator and has no their address. The IOG group can only release a new version. make a list of updates and allow people to consider changes in the source code. People can test the new version of the workstation app on their private network or public networks and voluntarily choose to install it on their computer. It is also necessary to have some communication channels between the group and the full node operator. This may be social networks or some discussion applications available publicly. you can see the basic form of management between the IOG group and the Pool operator of Cardano (only one operator in the picture). Pool operators do not necessarily have to trust the IOG group but can only trust the source code (do not believe in people. believe in the code) and decide whether to install a new version on their node. All operators in Cardano network can do this. The new version of the workstation application must be accepted by most Pool operators (and installed) to use new features or fix errors. the network will still be in the old version. One of the important aspects of the Blockchain industry is that the open workstation source and anyone can see it. This is a big difference from the companies that sell their solutions to people in some forms (whether people pay directly or the object of the advertising is targeted). how is this done?. Basically the same. with the difference is that there is less important node. ie the pool. so it is easier and faster to contact the Pool operator. Maybe they all know each other. both Bitcoin and Cardano have a separate development group. These groups maintain source code. improve and innovate. Sometimes they release a new version they provide to the full node operators. This is a basic form of decentralized management. It is important to understand how Bitcoin is different from Cardano about the role of the development group. Satoshi launched Bitcoin as a test. He did not want to relate to it. because. in the past. similar efforts to launch some forms of money that ended by the issuer being criminally prosecuted.',\n",
       " ' Satoshi handed over the Bitcoin project to Gavin Andreson and disappeared. Perhaps he didnt even think too much about administration. Perhaps he thinks that only someone has the control of GitHub and releasing new versions is enough. The source code of Bitcoin is not of the highest quality and is still being restructured by the group to develop to this day. Perhaps even Satoshi does not believe that Bitcoin will go far away. The location of Satoshi is completely different from the IOG group. the IOG group wanted to provide people with quality and reliable software without silly errors. The goal of the Cardano project is to have a decentralized system that allows the construction of replacement financial services. It is a great responsibility. from the beginning. it is clear that such a system will take many years to develop. The IOG group was an integral part of the project from the beginning. There are 5 era in Cardano development roadmap. The last era. Voltaire. reserved for decentralized management goals. The Cardano network was launched in 2017. but since 2015. the group has conducted a scientific research and deployed source code by peer-Reviewed. Network upgrading and increasing improvement are an integral part of the project. After the departure of Satoshi. people think that Bitcoin has ended and does not need to improve it too much. Although this is just a story and code that is being restructured. people begin to agree that Bitcoin will be a prudent project with the least change. Bitcoin players began to try to maintain this view on other blockchain projects and considered it as the only right view. Some people sometimes go further when they argue that Bitcoin has no development team or without a leader. or if the blockchain has a team. it must be focused. All these claims come from the ignorance of how to develop and maintain the software. The importance of the development group may be lowered. which can be pretended that the development team does not exist or vice versa that the code can be modified by anyone in the world. but it is important to remember that there must be a problem. Emergency issues and can save lives from death. In the event that the incident we have described above with Bitcoin. there is a need for a public contact and coordinating the restart of the network or proposing which string is right (no matter what it means). If Blockchain does not have a team of high -quality and experienced experts. my heart will not even want to use it for security reasons. Do you know the root cause of Bitcoin error?. The Bitcoin transaction test does not work well. The output may be so large that they are overflowed when calculated. A hacker discovered this and took advantage of it. Bitcoin should only have 21 million BTC. Hackers. in a single transaction. created Bitcoin more than 8.784 times compared to the necessary level. For the development group. the remedy is very simple and relatively easy.',\n",
       " ' But it is not always so easy. Some problems may be long -term or stemming from ineffectiveness that it was unclear or not an obstacle to the use of the network. such issues are the ability to expand low or the problem of long -term economic sustainability of Bitcoin (security budget). Members of the development group. as well as community members. may have different views on these issues and may propose different solutions. We come to other important questions. Who decides these issues? Who is responsible for implementing the solution? Where will the development group receive funding?. The group can make a decision from the position of power with good belief that they are doing the best for the project. This may also mean not to do too much and maintain the status quo. Or the group can make decisions with other members of the community. Which members and what will communication look like?. An important aspect in the form of basic management is described above. An expensive or scarce resource that needs to build the surrounding management mechanism. it is the ratio of hash. while in Cardano is ADA. Pool operators run several versions of the workstation. but the power of a certain node in the network (this is the number of blocks that the group may create) is decided by authorized power. This may not be applied to all blockchains. For both Bitcoin and Cardano. decentralized resources are owned by many entities. Operators authorize the hash ratio for groups while Stake people authorize ADA. any version of the workstation will dominate not only decided by the pool operations but also by the authorized people. Pool operators are forced to behave in a way to keep the favor of those authorized. you can see that the operator is running the group as well as the authorized people who have chosen to support the development team by authorizing ADA (or the hash ratio). This not only increases the chances of creating more blocks of the group but also shows the support for a specific version of the workstation application. Many people may not even realize that and only consider Stake (or exploit) as an opportunity to make profits from block production. The authorization of tokens is an expression of administration. Authorized person is a positive part of administration. Where is the liability boundary of the authorized person for the project? The authorized person should only decide the version of the workstation by authorizing a pool (their executives have installed a specific version) or should they have more control over the group?. If the authorized person has the control of the development group. it is actually only for the purpose of making communication more effectively. Instead of determining the results of the groups work. about the new version of the workstation app. the authorized person to decide what will be in the workstation app. It is a more active form of governance that requires higher participation. If the authorized person has no control over the development group.',\n",
       " ' the group can do or do not do almost whatever they want. The development team will determine which issues they will solve. when they will solve them and in any specific way. The team can be considered a dictatorial form. The participation of authorized people in this process can accelerate the resolution of a number of problems and identify priorities. the group became a community service. The authorized person may or should have more control over the development group?. you can see that the authorized people not only authorize the pool but also determine which changes will be in the source code. They decided what the development team would do. Cardano has the advantage that all ADA owners can not only participate in Stake but also participate in administration. How will the user determine how the network will work and what features should the network have? Users are related parties. so the incentives are adjusted appropriately. not all users are the owner of ADA. the allocation of power is different. because the authorized person is the exploitation. not necessarily the holder of BTC. There are many people holding BTC (hundreds of millions). significantly more than the exploitation (dozens to hundreds of thousands). Users (holders of tokens) can run their own full node. Think yourself to a common full node with a group that the ADA token or the authorized hash ratio and how to create blocks. the location of these nodes is not equal. An expensive resource is always the best protection measure against Sybils attacks. maybe and even desire to enhance the influence of an expensive resource on the groups operations. The administration is not limited to the decision of which version of the workstation will dominate the network. It is possible to invite those who are authorized to participate in the management process and give them the control of the development of the workstation. assigning responsibility to ADA holders is a reasonable step. because a development group cannot maintain the position of power forever. The project must develop and make innovations. Someone must decide. If the development group does not do that. this will be in the hands of the community. Ada holders in general must participate and have enough knowledge in different fields to make the right decision. One of the concepts to achieve this is the authorized representative. Some people think: One of the biggest legends is Charles Hoskinson with a stop button that allows him to turn off Cardano. This is completely absurd. Charles is the CEO of IOG and has the right to control the source code in the same group. it is completely similar to Bitcoin. Of course you will find some partial differences. The influence of the development group on Blockchain ends with the release of a new version. Development groups do not have the opportunity to basic impact on the installation process of the workstation and the production of blocks. the voting results in Catalyst Fund10 were announced. 192 projects from more than 1300 ideas received funding.',\n",
       " ' 50 million VND ADA will be distributed gradually to these projects. 409 thousand votes were abandoned. up more than 12. 5% \\\\u200b\\\\u200bcompared to Fund9.118 individual wallets have registered to vote. 48 billion of ADA coins were used to vote. accounting for about 1/5 of the total amount of stake. the results opened the controversy over the fairness of the vote. The Cardano community began to debate the large number of opposition votes affecting the voting results. If you look at the results. you will find that there are a large number of votes against all projects. including projects ranked in the leading position. A large number of votes are surprising. mainly for projects that seem to be obviously beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem or groups with good achievements. it is not our opinion but the opinion of the voters. Many people are surprised at the number of votes that are used (NO) and think that Catalyst should only allow the votes to agree (Yes). You can see an overview of the wallet compared to the voting right in the image below by Juan Pippo. the largest representative with 34. 38% has a wallet from 1k to 5k ADA. There are 19.639 this wallet. The total ADA in this group is 47. 3 million. The second largest group belongs to the wallets from 450 to 1000 dong ADA. There are 9.938 wallets in this group. accounting for 15. The total ADA in this group is 6. The third group is a wallet with 10k to 25k ada. There are 8.407 wallets. accounting for 14. 7%. The total ADA in this group is 129. The smallest representative is a single wallet from 75 million to 100 million ADA. The owner of this wallet holds VND 82. 8 million. The owner of a wallet has many voting rights more than 2 wallets with the most wallet. which is more than 30. You can find an overview or from a self -proclaimed author Ed N Stuff. 34 large whales. the wallets with more than 10 million ADA. have participated in the vote. They all have about 630 million ADA to vote. Many people think that 1 ADA = 1 votes are not a good mechanism. They propose various solutions. such as a quadratic vote or a system similar to 1 person = 1 vote. Proposals such as the quadratic vote cannot be done because whales can always divide their ADA into many wallets. This is much effort but can be done. All limitations and limitations at this level are not meaningful. It can only work if it is possible to link ADA to the real identity. this is unwanted in the Blockchain world. I understand that the same proposal is people. such as Stake in Ada for a longer time. will have a stronger voting right. Or one will make more on-chain transactions. This will not be effective. because even a whale can be stake for several years without changing the Stake level. A whale can even run its own pool.',\n",
       " ' A whale. like anyone else. can send a large number of transactions. That is just a fee issue. I see a suggestion that older wallets with less ada will have more voting rights. This is not a good idea because it will discriminate against newcomers. Why are new people participating in the ecosystem more voting than the elderly? If today a whale divides ADA into thousands of wallets. they will become an old wallet after one or two years. whales will maintain its position. The system I saw in the management model of other networks allows a person to have more voting rights by locking money over a period of time. The longer the number of coins are locked. the more voting rights will increase. even here. I still doubt. because a whales only need 10% of my assets and he can keep the rest of the same time as anyone else. Anyone who is willing to keep money in the entire market will lock the money for 2 years. Cardano has a liquidity stake and people want to use ADA in DEFI or just spend it. I think most people will not lock the coin for additional voting rights. So should we think of a system of 1 person = 1 vote? Cardano is a global network. People can vote from all continents in the world. including developing countries. Who will do KYC? Are people ready to provide KYC information for the benefit of Catalyst or on-chain administration? Rather no. and it is definitely not a condition. Perhaps it can operate with some decentralized identities (DID) will be used anonymously when voting. this can only be introduced at a time when most cardano users have DID. The only meaningful debate that seems to suit me is whether or not to cancel the downvote. Perhaps just upvote is enough. the number of votes that can help filter out the proposals that are not suitable for the vision and goals of Cardano or not feasible. not moral or not beneficial for the ecosystem. Opinions on this topic are different. The address with many ADA copper can appear in the system through some DEFI or Pool protocols. If everyone locks the ADA on DEX into the liquidity pool. they cannot vote directly through ADA because they do not hold them in their wallets. Some DEFI projects have allowed people to vote through another type of token about the use of ADA in Catalyst. This must be the standard. including receiving rewards when voting. people can send ADA from the DEFI protocol to their wallet before taking a quick photo for Catalyst. Consider this as a advice for Fund11. In POS consensus. anyone with more ADA can create more blocks. It works for the incentives set for people to act for the benefit of the protocol. Deliberately not casting block means financial losses. Whale behaves like small fish. Everyone wants to receive a reward. The incentive is linked. this will not work in Catalyst because teams compete with each other to win votes.',\n",
       " ' Can even vote against competitors. In case of administration. ADA is used differently from the consensus of the network. The encouragement of each individual is different because their goals are different. Although some projects (in my opinion is good) not receiving sponsorship. Catalyst is the best project we have. Many people in the community have commented on the results and offer new ideas and proposals. This is very positive. Catalyst is a test and can change. We congratulate all projects that have received funding from the Catalyst10 fund. The first block on Cardano was cast on September 23. at 11:44:51 pm. Cardano network has never needed to restart or need to restore blockchain. This is not all blockchain can do and can be considered successful. There is a single network problem that happened but the Cardano network could recover itself. Genesis blocks are the first block in the blockchain. All subsequent blocks can track their lineage back to the base. Genesis block acts as a reference point to verify the integrity and security of the network. Genesis block code is:. 5f20DF933584822601E3f8c024B5B252fe8CEFB24D1317DC3D432E940BB. Slot Leader is Hong Kong Input Output (Today is the Output Global Input). the R&D group is building Cardano. In Cardanos roadmap. you will see these era are named after celebrities: Byron. In the first Byron era. also known as the starting era. you can only send ADA from one wallet to another. The network operates in the link mode in which the nodes are controlled by 3 founding units IOHK. Emurgos first light Yoroi wallet was created. The IOHK group has worked on the full node wallet Daedalus. There have been studies that are taking place mainly on Ouroboross equity evidence. Ouroboros is the first Proof-of-Stake protocol created on the basis of academic research. with a mathematical proven level of security. The next Shelley era brought a decentralization to Cardano. On July 29. there was a hardfork Shelley. It was the starting day to take into Cardano. Hardver Shelley mainly shows a major change in the decentralized process of Cardano network. Although the transfer of consensus to the people holding Ada took place gradually (controlled by a parameter). the nodes operated independent operators were relatively quickly created 100% of all blocks. Cardano has become completely independent of the nodes operated by the IOG group. Cardano network celebrates 6 birthdays. it celebrated the 3 -year Stake and decentralized. Cardano encountered a network problem on January 22. Cardano had an unusual incident that made about 50% of the node disconnected and automatically restarted. Both transfer nodes and block production nodes are affected. Some nodes have been disconnected from peer -to -peer network nodes. Others automatically restart after an exception is thrown. Most of the affected nodes automatically recover and continue their work. The network works exactly as expected. The impact of incidents on block production is very small and concise. Cardano recovered through a kind of self -recovery mechanism. The consensus with the so -called final probability. which is very strong.',\n",
       " ' has played an important role. It is important that the pool operators are almost nothing. No need to agree or coordinate anything. No need to fix any errors in the code to return to the operating state. A similar event never happened again. Cardanos network is relatively upgraded. Not only consensus but also the plutus platform. network layer and other parts of Cardano are constantly improved. In the process of upgrading. the network was not interrupted because the group created a tool called the Hard-Fork complex for this purpose. Users can use 24/7 network even when upgrading the network. The Goguen era talks about Cardanos programming ability. which is smart contracts. This upgrade also takes place through the Hard-Fork complex. Cardano received a smart contract on September 12. when HardFork Alonzo appeared online. The group is currently studying the projects expansion and management capabilities. And the group is working in parallel with the tasks related to the Basho and Voltaire era. Cardano is a project with a significant progress of annual quality. The number of stake people. the number of tokens is cast. the DEFI applications are deployed and their users are increasing. This happened regardless of the going down. It is likely that we will celebrate 10 birthdays together.September 25. This article will consider Cardanos current expansion and consider the level that the Input Endorsers (input) can improve it. We will not mention Hydra or other options to expand the Cardano scale (on the layer 2). The latest improvement for the expansion of the first layer will be Input Endoser (although there may be a number of other solutions that have helped to improve in part). The index of transaction per second (TPS) can tell us how many people can use the network for a certain period of time. TPS can be understood as maximum networking. TPS is not a suitable measure because the UTXO -based accounting model allows sending many assets to many people in a transaction. Cardano transactions can send assets to 100 recipients and significantly smaller than when the network must handle 100 individual transactions. See the type of transaction that Cardano is currently processing. You will find that about 60% are transactions containing smart contracts. 35% are simple transactions (Alice sends assets to BOB) and 5% are super data transactions (metadata). To simply. we will use TPS data in the article and in most cases. we only consider simple transactions. TPS calculation is relatively easy. To preliminary estimates. we only need to know the block size. medium trading size and the frequency of the network creation. Cardano creates a new block every 20 seconds. The maximum size of a block and transaction is determined by the following protocol parameters:. A simple cardano transaction may have size from 250 to 500 bytes. A Cardano online trading has an average size of about 300 bytes. Trading with smart contracts or transactions with many inputs or outputs will of course be larger in size. The more transactions have more inputs and outputs.',\n",
       " ' the greater its size. one of the most valuable inputs of the wallet will be selected when performing the transaction. from which the two outputs are created. One output was sent to the recipient and the other output returned the rest to the sender. The transaction must contain witnesses (100-200 bytes). If we assume that there will be only 300 -byte trading in the block. each block will contain about 300 transactions. If we divide this number by 20 seconds (the frequency of casting a block of Cardano network). we will calculate the TPS of Cardano network is 15 transactions per second. If we assume that only transactions contain a large smart contract with a size of about 16.000 bytes in each block. there will be only about 6 for each block. TPS of Cardano network will be only 0. 3 transactions per second. a major Cardano smart contract transaction can be sent at the same time to about 250 recipients. and thus will have about 1.500 recipients in a bloc. If we calculate the TPS not according to the transaction but according to the number of recipients. the Cardano network can send to 75 recipients per second. With the current types of transactions. Cardanos current maximum pine is about 40-50 recipients per second. This figure is about 3 times higher than that we only consider TPS and simple transactions. It should be admitted that the size of the cardano block is relatively small compared to other blockchains. Bitcoin blocks have the theory of 4 megabyte (segwit) theory. The maximum actual size of the block is 2 megabytes. 6 megabyte last year. Bitcoin exploits new blocks on average every 10 minutes. Bitcoin can handle about 7 transactions per second. Ethereum produces average new blocks every 12 seconds. The block size of Ethereum is not fixed (not limited by the block size in byte) but depends on the amount of gas used by the transactions in each block. Gas limit (complexity of transactions) will determine the size of the block. The block size of Ethereum can be flexibly adjusted. the gas limit is placed in 15 million. In recent months. the block size ranges from 140-170 kilobytes. Ethereum cast about 7.200 blocks per day and authenticated about 1 million transactions. Ethereum has about 140 transactions in each block. The average Ethereum transaction is about 1000 bytes. Ethereum is operating almost reaching the maximum power limit and Ethereums TPS is 12 transactions per second. Algorand has a block size of 5 MB and the blocking time is 3. 3 seconds. It can make 6000 TPS and the group plans to improve that number to 10. Bitcoin has a long blocking time but thanks to that. it can be large in size. TPS is mainly limited by time limit. Ethereum has a blocking time about half lower than Cardano and at the same time the block size is about 2 times larger. the current TPS Ethereum is only 12. If we only calculate simple transactions about 500 bytes.',\n",
       " ' Ethereums TPS can be around 30. That number will be about 2 times higher than Cardano. Algorand is large in size and at the same time very low blocking time. This is one of the reasons why TPS is high. We will talk more about this project related to Input Endoser. The size of the Cardano block is most likely to be increased to 180 kilobytes and the frequency of mass creation can be placed in 15 seconds without negatively affecting performance. the TPS of Cardano will be 40. a little higher than Ethereum. increasing 10 TPS will not make a significant difference. Blockchain needs to be able to expand the scale of thousands of TPS in the next few years. Some networks are thought to be able to do that. Cardanos mission requires these similar numbers. Can Cardano achieve that through Input Endorsers?. Input endoser can increase the pine and speed of Cardano because transactions can be released continuously without waiting for consensus. Instead of having a block containing trading data. Cardano will have three types of blocks: Ranking Blocks. Endorsement Blocks and Input Blocks. The transaction will only be in the input blocks. The authentic blocks will refer to many input blocks. This is a concept very similar to what Algorand has deployed. It is called the pipeline block. Algorand uses the concept of transaction reference and that is one of the reasons why TPS is high (of course it is not the only reason). Before going into the endsoser section. briefly explain how the Pipeline block works in Algorand. The Algorand network randomly selected a user committee for each block. then they proposed and voted for the block in a single round. There are two types of blocks in Algorand: Main Blocks and Micro Micro (MicroBlocks). The main blocks are used to achieve online consensus. In addition to other things (information about the proposed person. the committee. the main blocks also refer to many micro blocks. Micro blocks are used to store transaction data. The committee votes only on the main blocks. not micro blocks. Micro blocks are verified by participating nodes before they are put into the main block. Algorand only includes reference to the status changes in the main blocks. instead of the whole status of the ledger. A reference is only the 32B hash function of the status changes that occur in a block. The hash is much smaller than storing the entire state. This reduces the size of the main blocks and allows the distribution and verification of blocks faster online. Input Endoser (of Cardano) and Pipeline (of Algorand) have many similarities:. It can be said that the IOG group will deploy a similar solution like a practical solution. there are also differences in both solutions. The biggest difference is probably the lead of the Algorand block based on a single authentic block. while Cardanos Input Endorsers is based on the decentralized structure of the inputs. the authentic block and the ranking block.',\n",
       " ' Describe the blocks that will be used in Cardano after the Endoser Input feature is provided. We will describe it from the top (the consensus of the network) to the bottom (data). The authentication blocks contain only reference to an input block. A authentication block can be referenced by other authentication blocks compatible with it. if the EB-1 authentication block refers to IB-1 inputs and other authentication blocks EB-2 refer to IB-2 inputs and both IB-1 and IB-2 without conflict transactions. EB-2 can refer to EB-1 as its root block. EB-2 becomes a sub-block of EB-1 and both EB-1 and EB-2 are compatible with each other. This allows the creation of the tree structure of the authentic blocks. in which each branch represents a different transaction collection that can be put into the ledger through the next ranking. The purpose of having many sub -blocks for an authentic block is to increase the chance of finding a collection of compatible verification blocks for each rating. The ranking block can refer to a collection of compatible authentication blocks. meaning that they do not have conflict transactions in the reference input block. By having many sub -blocks for a authentic block. the manufacturer can choose the best branch to maximize the number of transactions that can be put into the ledger. We will explain more details about the Endoser input in another article (including images). we just want to clarify the basic concepts. The most important thing to note is that blocks that have a basic transaction can be created (distributed online) continuously (every 0. 2-2 seconds). This means that instead of creating a data block every 20 seconds. there may be up to 10 to 100 input blocks that can be created at the same time. The high frequency of exploitation of inputs does not hinder the consensus of the network. Now focus on the ability to expand potential. A cardano block may contain 300 simple transactions. If the limited time for the input blocks is placed in 2 seconds. 10 blocks will be created within 20 seconds. corresponding to 3000 transactions. If placed in 0. there will be 100 blocks created with 30.000 authentic transactions. And then. TPS will increase to 150 to 1500 per second. If the network layer can increase the size of the inputs. it will have a positive impact on TPS. When increasing the input block to 180 kilobytes. Cardano may have TPS about 300 to 3000 per second. The expansion capacity increases depending on many quality and other network technology. such as Pipelining. The input confirmation feature can be used more effectively if other individual internet attributes can be improved. The important thing to mention is that TPS we present only. there will be conflicts between transactions. so it may only be part of the authentic block that enters the ranking blocks in certain rounds. The ability to expand the potential that Input Endoser can bring not only the input blocks (and the number of transactions in it) but also the ranking blocks.',\n",
       " ' The ranking blocks must be subject to the validity of block manufacturers who must ensure that they follow the protocol rules and consensus parameters. Checking the validity will require more resources because it is necessary to verify more transactions. Ranking blocks also have limited size and frequency of casting. It determines how many references can be included in a ranking block and the frequency they can be created (15-30 seconds). the ability to expand is not only limited by the input blocks but also by the rating blocks. Blockchain network cannot produce unlimited number of transactions because this produces a huge amount of data. The available data is one of the important aspects of blockchain expansion. checking the validity takes place on nodes around the world. The data must be available for them to perform the test. The larger the size of the block. the more it can handle transactions in the block but also need more bandwidth and storage capacity from the nodes. The shorter blocking time. the faster the transaction can be confirmed. but the higher the risk of branching (FORK) and orphans (ORPHAN Block). Development groups must be carefully balanced between decentralization and scalability. Only trying to increase expansion can have a negative impact on decentralization. as it can reduce the number and diversity of nodes that can participate in the consensus of the network and increase the power of certain nodes compared to other nodes. The Endoser input may not be the final improvement for the cardano protocol. It is often said that Sharding is essential to be able to say high expansion. Sharding also has disadvantages. mainly from the needs of connecting and synchronizing between Shard. Cardano will probably have sharding after deploying the endsoser input. A segment may have TPS almost like Cardano network with endososer input. a cardano with 10 shards can have TPS about 20. this is very far in the future and a lot of technology details will have to be studied. For example: Division at the storage level. improving Mithril and having a light workstation. taking into account the cutting data (abandoning old transactions).September 21. Over the past six months. more than 50 community workshops have been held around the world. the peak is a three-day conference in July 2023. in Edinburgh. where CIP-1694 representatives are gathered to promote minimum feasibility management (MVG). Two days of discussion about CIP-1694 were held with many different views. then the hackathon Tooling & Wallet for CIP-95 was organized to attract the community.

This is a very special place. the University of Edinburgh. many people have united with the desire to make Cardano better. This is the most complicated thing we used to do as a community. because what we are doing is to build an effective government to free all the values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bthat we have accumulated for us. as we have said that we have been transparent. At the beginning of management as a community and more than a thousand people spend time sitting in the room for a few days and talking about Dreps. the Constitutional Committee and the rights as well as the same issues are not necessarily what you expect. The core of Cardano is always maximizing the voice and freedom of each person. and providing them with a set of tools for them to determine what their own money is. determine what their own identity is. how to determine how society around them should work and operate. I hope that we can accomplish everything in just a few days and end really successfully. at the same time deploying and turning on CIP-1694. then we can consider this as one of the great moments in Cardanos history and hope that will have a lot. many more will happen in the next decades. ” - Charles Hoskinson. After the seven years. the Voltaire era was expected by many people to develop strongly. bringing on-chain administration and off-chain management to the top. This is really a moment worth celebrating. After a series of seminars stimulating innovation ideas and meticulous planning. people agreed and agreed on the highest level of management concepts. creating a premise for a completely new chapter on application management. Unlike traditional management systems. the flexibility of this pioneering method lies in the ability to systematize timely decisions and create conditions for quick adaptation and repetitive changes. When the community is preparing for the approval process in the coming months. the atmosphere is happy and expected. We are about to deploy a carefully built management structure and witness its application in the real world. Voltaire promises to revolutionize the government. Blockchain technology is giving unprecedented control individuals for the financial products they use and the system they participate in. a model that changes the model. people want to have a voice about their assets created. used and audited; They are no longer satisfied with passive dependence on traditional financial systems. The future of the global financial ecosystem will be shaped by the Voltaire era of Cardano. Workshops around the world promote different views and build consensus in the network. With the CIP-95 proposal. API connects the wallet. Cardano takes an important step in strengthening its decentralized management model. Ryan Williams (Voltaires technical analyst) has worked hard to expand CIP-30. ensuring the deployment of Voltaire will have many functions. By using the proposed API.',\n",
       " ' users will be able to interact seamlessly with Blockchain. participate in the features of Voltaire and participate in CIP-1694. CIP-95 has promoted the cooperation between wallet providers and tools in the ecosystem. who helped to perfect the design and bring us closer to the consensus of important open questions. When everything progresses. the suppliers quickly transformed into infrastructure providers. allowing users to exploit the entire potential of Cardano network. It is a noticeable development marking a change towards a decentralized and comprehensive ecosystem. opening up new opportunities for the participation of the community. With the upcoming CIP-95 deployment. Cardano enthusiasts are eager to further strengthen the management mechanisms of the network and create a vibrant. cohesive. ready to shape the future of Blockchain Administration. With Voltaire and CIP-95. the Cardano Blockchaino wallet will be able to speak positively to its future. bringing a new era to decentralized management. the wallet on Cardano was just a tool to manage money and stake. but now they are playing a great role in the future of the network. ADA holders can actively participate in the decision -making process and vote for suggestions. as well as sponsor projects that will help the ecosystem grow. This creative approach empowered users. giving them the only opportunity to affect Cardanos direction and create a long -term impact on the development of Blockchain. Marcus Fysh. member of the UK National Assembly. also attended this event and stated as follows:. “Of course. administration is what our political system is currently involved. I know how difficult it may be but it is important to the community when you feel that they are represented by their representatives and their views can be agreed by everyone. It is a really interesting project. Cardano is trying to provide autonomy rights to individuals around the world. It is possible to interact with each other safely and to have the freedom of interaction and freedom of speech is extremely important. this is a really important project and the management method is being discussed here as well as the blockchain management is an extremely important thing for the world to go in the right direction. ” - Marcus Fysh. With an inspiring expression of determination and solidarity. the Cardano community. along with the global Input Output and Cardano Fund. together solved the management issue. founder of NFTXLV and Buffy Bot publisher. was present at Edinburgh to attend this historic event and remind us of what President Kennedy once said. We do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. and this affection echoed when we continued this wonderful journey. Knowing that management is not easy. we are determined to make efforts and fully aware of how the final reward will be worthy. administration is related to navigating many different views and life experiences. but the spirit of cooperation between people from all components makes this process stronger. promoting integration and progress. The alliance between the community and the IOG and CF teams proves the power of solidarity before the complexity.',\n",
       " ' Thanks to the collective vision and non -stop dedication. they play an important role in shaping a brighter future. Through hard work and perseverance. Cardanos governance initiatives are willing to bring positive changes and open a new era of ability. When we are in the future. receive the challenge with an open bracelet. Cardano inspires all of us to believe in the potential for a better tomorrow. motivated by solidarity. resilience and common purpose. Each blockchain has a budget to pay for its resources. When the development group fails to adjust the recommended measures in accordance with the needs of the network. it will lead to ineffective or impaired quality of the main features. There must be many block manufacturers in the network. because this helps to perform smart contracts. increases the ability to expand or improve the finiteness of the transaction. You will understand this topic by comparing Bitcoin and Cardano. as both blockchain have significant needs. Different networks have different resource requirements based on their preferred tasks and characteristics. The favorite features of Bitcoin are security and decentralization. The expansion ability is resolved through Lightning Network. Cardano is a platform. and in addition to security and decentralization. it must also have good scale expansion. the performance of smart contracts requires higher processing power (CPU). Blockchain will only have the necessary amount of resources if they pay them. The resources are provided by volunteers and they often do it for personal economic benefits. If the recommended measures are not set appropriately and not suitable for the protocol design. it can lead to ineffectiveness or degradation of the system. This can also happen due to some changes in the environment or interests of the community. the obsolete technology of technology. economic reasons or other reasons. Bitcoin pays the operators. so it covers the costs of ASIC and their electricity. This affects the most confidentiality (more precisely protecting the 51%attack) and partially decentralized. Miner (miner) does not need to run adequate nodes. Full node operators have no economic motives to run them. Only pool operators are indirectly encouraged to operate nodes. They combine the hash ratio of the miners and can charge the fee (fees) for their services. the two dominant groups have a fee of 0. Bitcoins economic incentives do not support decentralized at the level of block manufacturers. A decentralization only occurs among the miners (lets ignore the focus on exploitation). Bitcoin was originally designed well because all users must be a miner. They can exploit BTC from home computers. and they will have economic motivation to run a full node. Sometimes they have the opportunity to exploit their own blocks. as the number of users increases. the opportunity will decrease (lets not go into that problem now). Bitcoin pays for security and decentralization. There may be a large number of nodes in the network. including many block manufacturers. With the introduction of Asic. two separate groups have appeared: miners and operators fully node. The miners began to authorize the hash ratio for some pool (node).',\n",
       " ' Those who hold the organizers are basically a third group separate from operating blockchain. And there has been a change in environmental impact on decentralization. It is a difficult question. Bitcoin should be decentralized as much as possible in terms of block production. but if the community does not bother and satisfied with the decentralization at the level of miners. it is okay. Bitcoin is not a smart contract platform so it does not need processing power (and other resources) to perform smart contracts. Bitcoin has no ambition to expand the scale in the first layer or achieve the completion of the transaction faster (and block). so resources (Node) are not necessary for that. Bitcoin (theoretically) can only work with a few dozen pools and exploitation tools. Full nodes are not required to hold BTC. If Bitcoin is mainly allegedly confidential. it seems that the incentives have been well established. the network will not have more mass manufacturers. the nodes have computer resources that the network can use somehow. Cardano is a smart contract platform and the ambition to significantly improve the ability to expand. and the network needs more resources. Cardano must directly pay for its decentralization. for the operation of block production nodes. Through the protocol parameter. the number of pools can be placed in the network. Economic incentives are set up so that the Stake reward will be the highest if there is a favorite saturated pool in the network. The fact is that the number of pool works is more than twice as much. and not all of them are completely saturated. Cardano returns the rewards directly to Pool operators as well as the Stake people. The Stake does not contribute any resources to the network. and they only receive a reward for decentralization (to authorize ADA for the pools). Pool operators provide their node. the resources they have to pay (hardware. Internet connection. Because the number of nodes is larger than Bitcoin. Cardano has enough resources to perform smart contracts and also to increase the ability to expand or improve the finite capacity of the transaction. Note that a normal full node in the Bitcoin or Cardano network cannot participate. such as faster transactions. because without economic encouragement (and interface in the game). it cannot guarantee that the full node will be operated reliably. always need to think about security issues. manufacturers can run a full node and somehow actively contribute their resources to the network. now it is just a theory. the active participation is running ASIC (not by keeping money). We can claim that Cardano directly pays for security. decentralization and expansion ability. because economic encouragement measures ensure that there will be sufficient number of nodes in the network. The consensus of Bitcoin and Cardano is very similar and must say that they are also ineffective in terms of resource use. Cardano uses the Nakamoto -type consensus mechanism. which means it follows the longest chain rule and needs to achieve the probability of transaction.',\n",
       " ' Both Bitcoin and Cardano work in a way that in every round. a node will create a new block and send it online. All other nodes in the network will then verify this block. The finite properties of the mass increased by the newly added block. Blockchain is basically different in the way the lottery spin takes place. all competitive pools to exploit a block at the same time by solving a complex POW mission. a drawer (slot leader) is drawn via VRF coding. Most of the node time is almost nothing. They can transfer transactions and put them into mem-pool. They cannot do anything related to block production. Only one node can do this in each round. although in fact this is a very simple task and can be completed within 1 second. Other nodes basically receive a block per ring (most ideal). they can also confirm this block within 1 second. It will be a bit exaggerated to say that the nodes in the Bitcoin network are basically not working for 10 minutes. Cardano produces average blocks every 20 seconds. most nodes do not work full time. What happens when an additional node produces new blocks added to the network? It will only increase decentralization (and will increase the demand for communication and synchronization). the complete calculation of transactions. passing the network or capacity will not be improved. The new node resources often cannot be used effectively. Bitcoin pays a huge amount of money for calculation power. but that does not help it when it comes to expansion. Money is only consumed by POW. As we describe above. Cardano has a large number of nodes (resources) but it does not use them effectively. But that is about to change. One of the planned improvements is called input endorsers. Input Endorsers improvement aims to improve the expansion and efficiency of Cardano by separating the selection of transactions from block production. ::: Tip Input Endoser. Input Endoser is randomly selected nodes based on their ADA shares. who are responsible for selecting and confirming transactions from MEM groups and spreading them online. all nodes can handle these confirmed transactions before the manufacturers of the block combined them into blocks. The blocks contain only reference to confirmed transactions. which reduces their size and complexity. :::. It is important to know that this solution can only be implemented because there are more nodes (pools) in the network. They can verify transactions that require executing authentication commands. The workload is distributed between all available nodes. The resources will be used effectively. Note that with multiple nodes. it is possible to maintain a high level of decentralization while increasing expansion. it is possible to solve the inefficiency of the system. Each newly added node will bring resources that can be used more effectively. the endorsers input increases complexity (higher requirements for communication and synchronization). not any cases where node can be added indefinitely and the effect will always increase. the complexity of mutual communication will prevent adding a new node in a significant way.',\n",
       " ' a similar solution cannot be implemented for many reasons related to the POW lottery. But it will not mean mainly due to the small number of block manufacturers and concentration. Only about 10 pools will confirm transactions and two of them will have the main voice. Note how economic encouragement affects the ability to improve the system. The article has the ambition to explain the relationship between economic encouragement and resources available for blockchain. The offer directly affects the attributes of Blockchain. We want to explain the basic principles. this topic is very complicated and cannot describe all the expressions. Economic encouragement measures determine the relationship between node mining and network manufacturers. Groups may set up the best ways to encourage possible before the network is deployed. but there may be events that require changing the economic model. I am sure that happened to Bitcoins case. this can also happen in the Cardano ecosystem. It is impossible to prepare a network for all future changes in environment or needs. because these changes cannot be predicted. we believe that the ability to adapt to new conditions through on-chain administration (or other form) is extremely important.September 20. Cardano uses the UTXO model and the small sets (SCRIPS) are authenticated on-chain. Ethereum uses an account -based model and all application logic is implemented in smart contracts. Lets explore how these different approaches affect the expansion options. The expansion ability is about computer resources that allow the networks operation. The blockchain platform is a global decentralized network that includes a large number of nodes operated by volunteers. These are the only computer resources available for the network. It is necessary to use these resources as effectively as possible if you want to achieve high expansion. The topic of cost and reward can be solved separately. The platform not only allows the transfer of value but also performs complex activities (smart contracts). When designing the platform. it is necessary to think about how to deploy the individual functions of the network so that they can consume as few resources as possible. Blockchain network needs the following resources:. The expansion of blockchain is affected by the available. efficiency and the use of the mentioned resources. The network that can be expanded can increase or optimize its resources to meet more users. transactions or more applications without reducing the performance and quality of the network. Individual applications may vary significantly on the requirements of processing. storage and bandwidth. The problem is not only the design of the platform but also the design and application design groups. The network design will allow the ability to expand gradually by providing more resources. but this also has limitations. Blockchain network needs high expansion ability. which means that they can handle more transactions every second (TPS). but they must maintain security. decentralization and function. This is a big challenge for the teams. increasing block size or reducing block time may increase TPS. but it also increases the requirements of storage and bandwidth of nodes.',\n",
       " ' as well as the risk of branching and orphans. Increasing the number of nodes may increase the security and decentralization of the network. but it also increases the delay and complexity of the consensus mechanism. Groups must be carefully balanced between all the important features of the Blockchain network. paying attention to the mission of the project and the requirements of the community. Blockchain should not sacrifice security and decentralization to gain expansion. there may be projects where expansion is more important than decentralization. The community expects benefits such as decentralized. transparent and recovery from the dispersed network. but these features bring limitations such as latency. complexity and coordination ability of the network (are unfavorable characteristics for expansion). The expansion ability is mainly affected by the design of the blockchain network (including the performance of smart contracts) and the accounting model. We will solve both. we will talk about Cardano as a platform using UTXO model and Plutus platform to verify the sets. Ethereum is a representative platform using an account -based model and Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) to make smart contracts. Most accounts using account -based model and EVM may have problems similar to Ethereum. if the management team deployed Sharding. they can expand the scale better than Ethereum. The purpose of the article is not to compare details of SC platforms but to attract attention to the difference in design. The UTXO model is like a verification system. in which each transaction output (UTXO) represents a digital property that its owners can spend. One of the advantages of the UTXO model is that it allows for better parallel processing. meaning that transactions can be handled independently and at the same time by different nodes in the network at the same time. as long as they do not use the same UTXO. This may improve the networks ability to expand and ventilate because more transactions can be verified and confirmed for a certain period of time. The UTXO model also reduces the demand for synchronization and coordination between nodes. because each node only needs to monitor the UTXO related to its transactions. Simple and safe UTXO model because it does not require complex logic or smart contracts to make transactions. It only includes simple arithmetic operations and password tests to verify the validity and authenticity of the transaction. The downside of the UTXO model is that it is more fragmented because it produces many small UTXOs that can be distributed on different addresses (Cardano and Bitcoin users often have money at many addresses). This may increase the number and size of transactions because it may need more input and output to meet spending requirements. The UTXO model also increases the storage and bandwidth requirements of the nodes because they need to store and transmit all UTXOs related to their transactions. Accounting -based model is similar to a more database system. in which each account has a balance that can be updated by transactions. It requires more synchronization and coordination between nodes.',\n",
       " ' as transactions need to update the global state of the accounts. Global state is a collection of all account balances and online status. this state increases over time and needs to be stored and verified by all nodes. The account -based model is worse in parallel because transactions may depend on or affect the status of other transactions. This can reduce the ability to expand and clear the network. because transactions need to be done in order of sequential and cannot be handled independently or simultaneously by different nodes. Global state consumes a lot of processing power because it needs to be calculated and verified by all nodes. This is especially applicable to complex or large transactions or the implementation of complex smart contracts. I will talk about transferring tokens and making smart contracts in the sequel. Blockchains using UTXO models can (at least theoretically) can achieve higher expansion and transparency than an account -based model because transactions can be verified in parallel. Blockchains using an account -based model may experience congestion or obstruction due to their global state. even the blockchain using an account -based model can expand good scale. The second layer (Rollups. Sidechains. ) is more suitable for this. When Cardano needs to execute a smart contract to verify a transaction. it is usually just a simple instruction. The authentication command usually contains only a few simple conditions (preferably only one condition) and their results are only the right or wrong return value (the correct value that allows UTXO spending). Commands are not intended to perform complex activities such as calling other contracts or performing complex calculations. Smart contracts on Cardano include ON-CHAIN \\\\u200b\\\\u200blogic (authentication) and off-chain logic. All complex smart contract activities are performed offline and does not consume dispersed network resources. To execute off-chain logic. user resources (wallets) or servers (clouds) will be used. Applications can be combined because groups are not limited by the ability of the platform in terms of interaction. This approach may have a disadvantage in a decentralized context. Many DEX in the Cardano ecosystem use the processor in batches. the decentralization of the off-chain part of the contract is possible. Another important thing is how many cases needed to perform smart contracts. Cardano has the original property. which means that the token transfer is guaranteed directly by the Cardano protocol and does not need to perform the smart contract (or instructions). Cardano is also effective in that many tokens can be transferred to many recipients in a transaction. This mainly saves storage and bandwidth. DEX can create a big transaction including many swap transactions. Ethereum has no original property. All tokens are created through smart contracts. must be executed for all interactions with tokens. including transferring them from one account to another. This requires more network calculated resources than the original assets. Smart contracts on Ethereum contain almost all application logic. the implementation of them requires very high network resources. Like transactions. smart contracts must be done sequentially. Most Ethereum works require a smart contract.',\n",
       " ' except for ETH transfer. If we are talking about the ability to expand better. we need to consider it through the lens of using resources. The resources are always limited and the goal is to maximize the use of them. meaning the use of certain resources to achieve the maximum TPS. The difference between the UTXO -based model and an account -based model that can be clearly explained by considering the input ending (IE) (IE) (will be available in Ouroboros Leios). IE is a way to improve cardanos expansion. We will point out how IE improves Cardanos expansion. as well as why it is impossible to deploy something similar in the case of an account -based model. Cardanos expansion and efficiency can be improved by separating transactions from block production. Transactions may be processed by the network (authenticated) before inserting into a block. Transactions can be selected and confirmed by the endsoser (nodes randomly selected based on shares). The transactions are later confirmed to be transmitted online and processed by other nodes before the manufacturers of the block combined them into blocks. The blocks only contain references to confirmed transactions. Note that when transactions are put into a block. they will have confirmed from many nodes. This improves the completion of the transaction. IE reduces the delay and variability of the transmission time because transactions can be continuously transmitted without waiting for consensus. This also improves the speed and ability of the network. Transactions can be processed in parallel by different nodes before being put into blocks. so it increases the flow and capacity of the network. Cardano will be able to handle more transactions (and they may be more complicated). IE takes advantage of the UTXO model. more accurate than its parallel. IE is different from Sharding (fragmentation). this is another technique to expand the Blockchain network scale. IE does not require communication or synchronization between segments because all nodes handle transactions that are confirmed the same before they are put into blocks. IE supplements Sharding as it can improve the expansion and efficiency of each segment or layer of the network. Cardano may have sharding after IE is deployed. Input endoser may not be easy to apply for account -based model. The authentication of each transaction depends on the authentication of all previous transactions. which is on the global state. Ethereum nodes cannot be verified (before) transactions that do not know the global state (future). The model is based on an account that requires more synchronization and coordination between nodes. because transactions need to update the global state of the account. Ethereum nodes cannot take part of transactions and verify them independently of other transactions. The problem is that the global state only changes in one place in the network (block manufacturer) and all other nodes have to wait until they can verify the new block. nodes will often be idle. Ethereum should have had Sharding. but the development team gave up this intention and Sharding will now be more than the second -grade application.',\n",
       " ' Lets think about what Sharding on the model -based model will look like. Sharding is a blockchain division technique into smaller parts. called segments. which can handle parallel transactions. Sharding may increase the ability to expand and clear the network. but it also poses the challenges and innovation. One of the challenges related to the global state is how to ensure the consistency and security of cross-shard transactions. which are transactions related to accounts or contracts on different segments. Transactions between segments that require coordination and communication between segments. this can cause delay and complexity. cross fragmented transactions may face the risk of twice or rearranged spending attacks. in which toxic agents try to manipulate order or the validity of transactions. Each segment (shard) will have its own global state and that state will have to be synchronized between all segments. Each segment may have its own independent state. which means a set of account balances and smart contracts. The global state of the network (all segments together) will not be a fixed state. It will have to be a dynamic state and grow depending on the interaction and consensus between segments. If the network only has one state at a certain time. the network may be extremely inefficient and require many communication activities as well as synchronization. Deploying Sharding on Cardano will also be a big challenge. it is simpler than the account -based model. When the input confirmation feature is ready. Sharding may be considered. The EUTXO model may have some advantages for sharding deployment compared to the account -based model thanks to the natural parallel processing attribute. Many nodes are actively participating in Sharding at the same time. IE will help with it. Transactions can be released continuously without waiting for consensus. so it will reduce the delay and complexity of cross fragments. Similar to account -based model. Sharding requires more synchronization and coordination between nodes. Node will have to be aware of not only their segments (for example. their own UTXO) but also at least aware of the surrounding segments. It may be necessary to deploy a number of global (dynamic and developing) states of the network (all segments together). The deployment of Sharding on account -based models or UTXO -based is not a simple task. Although this may be easier for the UTXO model (mainly thanks to parallel). this is certainly not an easy goal. The expansion ability of Blockchain (and platform) is affected by a ledger. network design. optimization and other things. Mithril will allow creating non -state workstations. which are nodes that do not store the entire state of the blockchain but only verify transactions with cryptography. the ability to expand is mainly about the smart use of computer resources in the best way possible and the ability to supplement resources. But this has its limit (unlike centralized networks) and groups must be balanced between the important attributes of the network. Even if the UTXO -based model seems to be more favorable in terms of expansion.',\n",
       " ' it may not be the best solution possible for the case of specific use that this platform offers. The best asset of the project is a development group that can be said to adjust the project to suit the market conditions or the communitys desire and offer the necessary solution to apply at a certain time. Low expansion is a barrier when it interferes with the application more widely. There are projects (thought to be) capable of handling thousands of TPS in the first class (layer 1). but they are not in the top 10 in terms of capitalization. The term of ossification (freezing and unchanged) is often used to refer to the difficulties in changing or updating the protocol of Bitcoin. Many people believe this is the best way to apply Bitcoin. The IOG group and the community went in the opposite direction in the case of Cardano. Cardano means innovation. adaptability and improvement. A Hard-Fork (Hard-Fork Combinator) complex has been developed to easily update the protocol. Think about which approach will be more beneficial to the future of the protocol. OSSIFICATION is a trade -off problem between stability and innovation. as well as the goals and interests of stakeholders. Some people may argue that the OSSIFICATION process is the desire when a technology or a protocol has reached an optimal and optimal state. and the next changes will only cause unnecessary complexity or risk. Others may assume that the OSSIFICATION process is detrimental to the advancement and development of technology and continuous adaptation and improvement are necessary to meet the needs and challenges of users and the environment. Whether Bitcoins opinions are fully accepted. mature and in optimal state or not only subjective. Some related parties believe that the Bitcoin development process has ended and nothing needs to change or improve further. while others confirm the opposite and want to change and upgrade Bitcoin for many reasons. There is an unanimous viewpoint in the Cardano community that the protocol must be renewed and improved further. The question about which direction to go. At a greater level. this is still decided by the IOG group. Belief in the project largely depends on the groups ability to innovate. Note that these are two completely different community approaches about the future awareness of Blockchain. The Cardano community clearly sees that if the protocol (including the plutus platform) is still rigid and unchanged (except for the necessary maintenance). the project will likely fail soon. The success of the project is based on technology dominance and application. The application is motivated by technology. The unification of Cardano protocol is not in the agenda. There is no consensus on this topic in the Bitcoin community. Perhaps the common view is that petrification is good for the Bitcoin protocol and the innovations will take place in other classes. this may be due to an important part of the group and influencers talking about the process of forming the Bitcoin protocol. The second faction is also strong.',\n",
       " ' calling for solutions to the urgent and innovative issues of the first floor. To expand our context. lets look at the past. Cardano and other blockchains are basically just protocols. look at the oldest. TCP/IP is an example of a protocol that has been strengthened over time due to its wide compatibility and application requirements. TCP/IP was designed in the 1970s and became the foundation of the Internet since then. The application of TCP/IP of other networks and organizations increases in the following years. especially after the domain name system (DNS) was introduced in 1984. In the early 1990s. TCP/IP became the dominant protocol for the Internet as well as many local networks and wide networks (LAN and WAN). The development of the World Wide Web. using TCP/IP as the basic protocol. has further accelerated the application of TCP/IP of millions of users and organized around the world. In 2000 and 2010. TCP/IP continues to be the most widely used protocol set for data communication. despite some challenges and limitations. such as security issues. obstruction problems and exhausted addresses. The acceptance rate of TCP/IP is very low in the 1970s and early 1980s. moderate in the late 1980s and early 1990s. high in between the 1990s and early 2000s. and very high in the late 2000s and 2010. There is no definitive answer to the question of TCP/IP that is consolidated in any year. because the OSSification process is not a binary or sudden phenomenon but a process gradually and continuously depends on many different factors and views. We may argue that the OSSIFICATION process may have occurred in the year that TCP/IP becomes the protocol set for the Internet and when most of the competitive or other replacement protocols are abandoned or shattered on the sidelines. This happened between the 1990 and 2000s when the development of the World Wide Web has accelerated the application of TCP/IP applications of millions of users and organizations around the world. We can also consider it the way that the freezing process begins in 1995 and lasts until 2010 with the increasing application. it is important to note that TCP/IP is not completely fixed or immutable. as it still develops and adapts to a certain extent over time. TCP/IP successfully because it has many advantages over competitors. It is designed to operate strongly and can be said to adapt to different types of networks and equipment. using classification architecture and module approach. TCP/IP allows interaction and compatibility between suppliers and different platforms because it is based on an open and standardized protocol. TCP/IP allows the development and deployment of different applications and services. such as email. file transmission. remote access and streaming. The application of these services (protocol) has supported the application of TCP/IP. this is a bit reminiscent of smart contract platforms that allow the construction of DEFI protocols. the process of forming the blockchain protocol may occur at the stage where its technological parameters do not prevent mass application. the application can develop according to the needs of the market and not limited by the protocol in any form.',\n",
       " ' TCP/IP successfully because it can be said to be expanded enough for people to apply. TCP/IP must be able to say adaptation to different types of networks and devices. it must allow the ability to interact and must be compatible between suppliers and different platforms. TCP/IP is the best solution available on the market in terms of expected features. Crypto protocol is different from TCP/IP at many points. Expansion ability. adaptability and interactive ability (and other things) may not be the main features. What are the main features that help it defeat the competitor? In my opinion. it is mainly a decentralization. immutability of monetary policy. the ability to expand and economic sustainability (privacy budget). It is important to note that these may be different features for others. Blockchain networks. have not existed long enough to say that they have matured and in optimal state. I believe that all development groups need to continue improving and innovating blockchain protocols. The market is in the stage that has not decided what features people expect from Blockchain and what they appreciate. Lets ask ourselves a few simple questions. Do people want or need a single and unique digital value storage vehicle in the form of Bitcoin or DEFI running on many smart contract platforms? Can DEFI emerge in Bitcoin ecosystem and better on other smart contract platforms? Will Crypto have the largest scale or have the best DEFI to become a valuable storage vehicle? Is a protocol as a place where the value storage needs to be expanded with good scale? Will people attach great importance to decentralization or more expandable ability?. In this way we can ask more questions. I dare to say that no one knows the correct answer right now. All those who declare in advance and know exactly what people want to deliberately lie or guess only. We will only know the answer when Blockchain becomes the main trend. it is meaningless when talking about the formation of a protocol that does not allow applications due to low expansion. it has problems with decreasing decrease or uncertain whether it is economically sustainable in the long run or not. There is currently no blockchain ready to apply mass. Nothing is fully accepted by a large number of important users. I believe it is too early to talk about Bitcoins formation. It is impossible to improve its features and solve urgent problems is a disadvantage in the context of future applications. A major feature of the blockchain protocol is to allow interactions between users at a distance. This is based on the properties of TCP/IP. allowing information exchange and then value exchange (Internet and Crypto banks). See if Bitcoin is well prepared for its ability to expand. about 550.000 transactions are waiting to be authenticated in Bitcoin temporary memory group. This despite the fact that there is Lightning Network (LN). The use of LN has decreased -84% since last year. The capacity has dropped sharply -15% in the past 3 months.',\n",
       " ' It seems that people do not use LN for some reason. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and the ability to expand is still an unpopular issue. Experts agree that it may take another 5-10 years to solve the basic problems of LN. it is not sure that people will use LN. It may be necessary to start working in another second -class and maybe it will require some major changes in the Bitcoin protocol. If you think about other Bitcoin technology issues. you will find that this is definitely not the right time to create it. In the early stages of the blockchain protocol. it will be beneficial if they are flexible and can adapt to new conditions and market expectations. It is important to achieve the best characteristics of the process before the actification process actually occurs. I dare to say that the Bitcoin protocol will change and the problems will be solved. This will happen despite the current stories. Cardano and many other projects where groups work every day to improve and innovate. Technology development is the factor that takes this industry forward and will allow widely applied in the final stage. Digital scarcity is not the most unique ability of Bitcoin but one of the characteristics of blockchain technology. Bitcoin will have 21 million BTC. Cardano will have 45 billion ADA. The digital scarcity is basically the same. The basic difference is the need for token. The main demand may depend on speculation (or belief) or useful. the ability of the protocol maintains digital scarcity in the long term (privacy budget) and ensures immutability (decentralized). The crypto industry is currently mainly affected by speculation and belief. I expect the utilities to play an increasingly important role in the future. The quality and utility of blockchain protocols will increase thanks to innovation and technological progress. The story of the characteristics of the means of storage is dangerous because it seems like innovation and more useful features (DEFI) are not necessary to succeed. I believe this is a false story. If the two projects provide similar digital scarcity and a more useful project than the other project. it is likely that the following project will be more successful. Faith and stories can lead to high network effects. But can the network effect be based on stories that can be better than network effects based on direct digital interaction between users? We know from history that direct network effect (because of applicability) is the cause of the success of companies such as Amazon. X (formerly Twitter) and Google. These companies today are more successful than many national or religious governments. Cardano is based on innovation and technological progress. which is essential for the development of direct network effects. All current obstacles prevent the application of Blockchain more sooner or later will be overcome. DEFI is definitely a suitable and useful industry for hundreds of millions of people not only in Western countries but mainly in developing countries. The biggest obstacle in the application of Crypto is not only the ability to expand but also the high frequency of hacking.',\n",
       " ' high fluctuations. low privacy and high consumption. especially the POW network. These are all issues that can be solved in terms of technology. Many factors will affect the success of blockchain protocols. Not only stories and technologies but also the original. network effect distribution. and many other things. Bitcoin has existed for a very long time and we can ask if its current acceptance rate is low or may be higher. It will probably depend on whether we are optimistic or pessimistic. it is important to grow even more. Not in the sense of faith. in the number of Hodler. but in the sense that users. those who will send BTC to each other online. I dare to say that the acceptance rate is still very low in the context of the number of payment transactions. TCP/IP has defeated all competitors and is an outstanding infrastructure to transmit information and values \\\\u200b\\\\u200bvia the Internet. All blockchain protocols use the Internet. basically they are only one layer (application) above TCP/IP. I believe that no blockchain has the opportunity to set up a dominant position in the market such as TCP/IP. as a global digital currency in the future as well as financial infrastructure. Like you just want Google to exist to search for information and only Paypal to transfer value. TCP/IP allows competitive protocols to appear and thats a good thing. It is the innovation that will determine success. We may have to wait a few decades to get the unity of blockchain protocols.September 9. Everyones interest in Crypto decreases in a price market. This is also true for Cardano. there are some quite positive trends. Lets look at statistics and think about the results. You might be surprised to have some meme can beat Cardano. What does this show? What does Cardano need to succeed?. see how Cardano has been working on statistics in the past 5 years. We used Google Trend. a useful tool for anyone who wants to understand what people are looking for on Google and how their search behavior changes over time and field. Please note that Google search is not a dominant search engine in all Asian countries. for the purpose of the article. this is enough for us. We can see that the most interest in Cardano is by 2021. this is a year the market price increases for the entire Crypto industry. we can see that the interest has decreased by 90% compared to the peak. On the positive side. we see the interest in Cardano is still higher than 2020. about half. If we add two most famous projects Bitcoin (blue) and Ethereum (red) to statistics. we will see that they are moving very similar to Cardano (yellow). The interest in Bitcoin dropped sharply by 84%. People seek information about Bitcoin more often than Ethereum. Compared to Cardano. the difference is 16 times. With Bitcoin. we can see many peaks regularly. This can be caused. due to the collapse of the FTX trading floor or due to speculation about the launch of ETF.',\n",
       " ' Bitcoin is the largest crypto. so the positive and negative events all attract the attention of the media. The interest in Bitcoin is similar (or slightly higher) like 2019 and 2020. Maybe people are familiar with Bitcoin and dont search for information about it regularly. It is also possible that Bitcoin has no DEFI. so people do not need to find out specific information about the DEFI service. unlike the SC platform. Ethereum is not better than Cardano significantly statistically. People seek information about Ethereum only about 3 times more often than Cardano. This was a surprising result and I thought it was a bigger difference in favor of Ethereum. You can see the comparison of Ethereum (blue) and Cardano (red) in the chart below. Although we can observe the interest in Cardano continuously decreases. sometimes there are peaks in the case of Ethereum. this may occur due to the conversion process to Ethereum 2. 0 or some large hacks. For context. see the frequency of people looking for information about Bitcoin (blue) and AI (red). In 2020. AI is basically a marginal theme that is not interested by many people. Who is just slightly better than Bitcoin in terms of statistics. In the growth market. Bitcoin clearly gained the attention of everyone. With the introduction of chatgpt. we can observe the skyrocketing interest of everyone. It continues until now. Bitcoin is also interesting for people like who. Important events can attract attention in a short time. If you think that most ordinary people do not care much about anyone. then according to statistics. Bitcoin is also in the same situation. Ethereum and Cardano are even worse than Bitcoin. In the case of whose case. we still do not know whether the interest rate will decrease or remain the same. Everyones attention can be maintained if new services appear on the market. Lets look at the chart where we consider Cardano (blue). Dogecoin (red) and Shiba Inu (yellow). Dong Meme defeated Cardano about statistics. there is more interest in Meme more than Cardano. everyones interest in these projects is almost similar. Meme can reach peak more often. The most frequent reasons that make people lose interest in Crypto are high fluctuations. hacking frequency and much fraud. The Crypto market has also been criticized for affecting the environment. especially for projects using Proof-of-Work (POW) as a consensus mechanism. Other reasons are low utilities. uncertainty or lack of education. these reasons may not be as important as the reasons mentioned earlier. It is clear that normal peoples interest in crypto is mainly motivated by speculation. People do not care much about terms such as smart contracts. proof-of-stake or decentralized. Do not mind that people do not care about technology details. Understand how the Proof-of-Stake works or smart contracts are similar to asking people to know how to operate the touch screen on the phone. encrypt on the internet or machine learning. Most people dont know this but they can still use modern technology.',\n",
       " ' The important thing is not how it really works but how people can benefit from the use of technology. One thing people should be more concerned about is decentralized terms. A decentralized concept is the foundation of the entire blockchain industry. If people do not understand the principles and benefits of decentralization. the additional application will be difficult. It is clear that many people buy crypto without understanding their mission and potential benefits to society. Most people only speculate on their market price growth. This finding is especially uncomfortable in Cardanos case. because the community cares about the projects high decentralization and is interested in the introduction of On-Chain Administration. You dont even need to enter this phrase into Google Trends. I will tell you immediately that ordinary people dont know what it may be. It seems that comparing individual projects with each other is meaningless because it is not interested in everyone and they themselves do not know what is really important. they are still ready to use DEFI. Stablecoin and NFT. See the chart below:. The NFT field has quickly become interesting for the community as the market price of BTC. Interested in DEFI and Stablecoin are increasing. People do not care about the technology details they are interested in using blockchain. ie utilities. If people use DEFI service to bring economic benefits. they will use them. If the seller accepts stablecoin. a part of the population will pay by them. If there is a high fluctuation in the national fiat currency in developing countries and people have access to Stablecoin on Blockchain. this will be a solution to their problems. The blockchain industry needs people to start using the daily blockchain services. People must consider Blockchain as a useful technology that they can use for their own benefit. Speculation is not a utility in the context of Western financial services such as payment. lending. there are many speculators and very few users. This needs to be reversed in order to be right. Speculators and investors must be a minority. like in other industries. There are a large number of iPhone users in the world but Apples shareholders are much less. What is the ratio between speculators and real users? There are about 550 million people holding crypto. Most of them hold crypto on centralized exchanges. On-chain services are used by 2-3 million daily users. I estimate that there may be 300 times more than the number of people speculators. it is hard to believe that people are more interested in Cardano. I dont want to offend those who hold the aforementioned memes. but the difference in technology and potential between them and Cardano is huge. I believe the mission of the cardano project is very important and can benefit many people. Meme has no meaning other than speculating. Many people may lose their money in the future. It is good to ask the Cardano community to do anything else when all the efforts of the groups and all the builders are overshadowed by the meme.',\n",
       " ' There are many members of the MEME army so the Cardano community will have difficulty. It is important to explain the mission of the cardano project for newcomers. They do not think that the blockchain industry only acts speculators. They need to understand that this is a problem of decentralized technology development and this takes time. It is necessary to explain to everyone that if this technology can be transferred. it may have any impact on society. People do not care about decentralization. but without it. the blockchain industry will not mean anything. VC funds will invest in centralized solutions and I believe people will use them. Does Cardano have the opportunity to succeed just because of its decentralized quality?. The argument that people should use Cardano because it is said to be the most concentrated may not be effective. This is the fact that we have to solve. Cardano must maintain decentralization while providing useful services for everyone. Cardano needs a foothold in the DEFI and need Stablecoin to be supported in USD as soon as possible. Decentralized projects only arise only due to failure services and institutions. I believe that the DEFI and Blockchain services are concentrated or poor or late sooner or later will fail. When that happens. Cardano still has to be here to accept the user being disappointed. I believe that decentralization will win in the long run. we are building a 2. 0 banking system. which looks decentralized but basically still like the current system.September 7. In the previous article. we explained how to run the Smart Collection or Smart Contract on Bitcoin. we will compare Cardano and Ethereum. We will focus primarily on transaction fees. We will explain what fees depend on and how they are affected by the design options that the groups have made when building the platform. The implementation of smart contracts in the distribution network will consume computer resources. Users must pay a smart contract. The contract performance requires more resources than the authentication of a regular transaction. so the fee is usually higher. To measure the amount of calculation efforts needed to perform smart contracts on Ethereum. the concept of gas is used. GAS is the unit representing the smallest work that can be done by the Ethereum (EVM) virtual machine. Each activity can be done by EVM with fixed gas costs. For example: Add two numbers that cost 3 gas. while saving a value to a memory cost 20 gas. Taking the same steps in the same smart contract will always consume the same amount of gas. The user fee depends on the gas cost. which is the number of ETH paid for each gas unit. Gas costs are not fixed by the protocol. which users set out when sending transactions or implementing smart contracts. The more the authentic person receives the ETH. the more likely transactions or contracts are. the more likely it is to be included in the next block. Users must pay a different amount of ETH to perform similar activities in the same smart contract.',\n",
       " ' depending on the gas price they choose. Gas price is a market -based mechanism that allows users to set bids for limited network resources. The gas model has some advantages and disadvantages for users. it allows them to have some control over their fees and prioritize smart transactions or contracts according to their emergency level and importance. it also causes some complexity and uncertainty in estimating and managing fees as well as ensuring their smart transactions or contracts are successful and timely. Cardano uses a different fee system with Ethereum. regardless of gas or gas costs. Cardanos fee system is based on two protocol parameters: A and B. The formula for the minimum fee for a transaction (TX) is: Charge = A + B * Size (TX). of which:. if a 200 -byte -sized transaction. the fee for transacting will be (0. 000043946 * 200) = 0. Fee for a transaction on Cardano does not depend on the calculation complexity or network congestion. It only depends on the size of the transaction. determined by the number and type of input. certificates and super data in the transaction. the fees on Cardano is simpler and easier to predict than the Gas model on Ethereum. To perform the same contract on Ethereum. users can pay a different amount of ETH each time. while for Cardano. the fee in ADA will be the same. The fee on Ethereum cannot be predicted while on Cardano can be predicted. Everything becomes complicated because the fact that ETH and ADA market prices are also unpredictable. The fee system on Cardano also has some limitations and challenges. One limitation is that it does not allow users to prioritize their transactions by paying higher fees. as they can do on Ethereum. All transactions on Cardano are treated equally by Spos. The process of handling transactions is easier to predict because it works on the basis of who comes first to be served first. This is the behavior that users expect in some cases but not always an advantage. Another challenge is that the protocol parameters A and B must be carefully adjusted to balance the interests of users. developers and pool operators as well as adapting to changes in transaction volume. hardware price and market price of ADA. Another difference between Cardano and Ethereum involves payment for unsuccessful transactions and the impact of unsuccessful transactions on the ledger. users also have to pay ETH for failed transactions. This is because the authentic person still needs to confirm the transactions and execute the smart contract. even if they fail or revert. The fee is paid to calculated resources used by transactions. regardless of its results. This can lead to unwanted costs and losses for users. Cardano users can verify in advance whether the transaction may be verified or not. This is because Cardano uses a definite transaction diagram. which means that the result and impact of the transaction can be predicted before it is executed on the ledger. Cardano also uses a two -stage authentication method.',\n",
       " ' in which the first stage checks whether the transaction is built accurately and can pay fees or not. and the second stage runs the instructions in the transaction. If the transaction surpasses both stages at the local machine. it will also transfer them online. unless there are changes in the ledger state caused by other transactions that are handled in the middle. If the transaction fails in the early stages. it will be canceled immediately and without paying. If the transaction passes the first stage but fails to be successful in the second stage. it is still put into a block and has to pay a fee. but the transaction has no influence (unpredictable) for the ledger state. This is because Cardano uses an extended UTXO model. ensuring that the transactions are determined and predictable. Transactions on Ethereum may have unpredictable effects on the ledger. depending on the results of the smart contracts they perform. Some operations may not be successful or reconstituted for many different reasons. These unpredictable effects on the ledger can lead to unwanted costs and losses for users to start trading or implementing smart contracts. if the user sends ETH to the Smart Agreement failed or reconstituted for any reason. the user will lose the ETH that they have sent and also have to pay for the unsuccessful transaction. Cardano and Ethereum platforms have different approaches on how they handle and verify smart contracts. Cardano uses a modular approach. in which smart contracts include two components: ON-CHAIN \\\\u200b\\\\u200bcode and off-chain code. Ethereum uses monolithic approach. in which smart contracts are fully executed and completely verified on Blockchain. Another approach has an impact on fees. security and expansion. The amount of fee for on-chain services depends on expansion. look at the ability to expand. The Gas model of Ethereum has some problems of expansion. as it produces a bottle of the bottle in terms of network capacity and is a source of fees. Network capacity is limited by the gas limit of the block. this is the maximum amount of gas that the authentic person can be put into a block. The gas limit of the block is not fixed by the protocol but the authentic person voted based on their interests and interests. The higher the gas limit of the block. the more transactions or smart contracts can be processed in one block. but the authentic person also needs more resources to verify and store the block. These expansion problems on Ethereum negatively affect both users and developers. Users must pay high and unpredictable fees for their smart transactions or contracts. which reduces their usability and payment capabilities. Developers face the management and estimate of complicated and uncertain fees for their applications. which increases the cost of project development. Cardanos charging system has some advantages of expansion compared to Ethereums gas model because it does not depend on gas. Network capacity is not limited by the block limit. but instead is the block size limit. The block size limit ensures that all blocks can be verified and stored effectively by all authentication processes.',\n",
       " ' regardless of their calculation resources. The fee on Cardano is stable because they only depend on the size of the transaction. determined by its content and structure. The size of the transaction does not change much depending on the operations or events of the network because it does not reflect the complexity or urgency of calculation. These advantages of expansion on Cardano bring positive benefits to both users and developers. Users can pay a low fee and can predict their smart transactions or contracts. which increases their usability and payment capacity. Developers can handle simple and certain fees management and manage their applications. helping to reduce costs and development risks. The dependence of charges on the scale of transaction also has another advantage that we will mention below. Cardanos fee system also has some challenges about the ability to expand to be resolved in the future. One challenge is that it does not take into account the cost of memory to track the accumulated chain status. especially the UTXO. All authentication processes must store UTXO in memory to verify new transactions or smart contracts. When multiple transactions or smart contracts are processed on cardano. more UTXOs are created and stored in memory more. which increases the consumption of memory and costs for the authentic person. As we said. another challenge is that users cannot prioritize their smart transactions or contracts by paying a higher fee. Now lets consider different concepts to understand what smart contracts are. We described it in detail in the article mentioned in the introduction. You can see a simplified version in the following image. On-chain code is a set of commands (authentication instructions) running on the blockchain to verify transactions related to smart contracts. Off-chain code is an application running on the users computer to create transactions that follow the smart contract logic. On-chain code is written in plutus and translated into Plutus Core. a low-level language running on Cardano virtual machine (CVM). The off-chain code can be written in any language that can interact with the Node Cardano API. It is important to note that the authentication sets are usually small and have the least manipulation. It mainly unlocked by performing simple operations such as checking signatures. verifying the hash function or comparing values. On-chain logic can also perform some complex operations. such as creating random numbers. creating irreplaceable tokens or deploying the status machine. these activities are often more expensive and less effective than when they are deployed according to off-chain logic. The execution they require more resources for each execution on Blockchain. this may be expensive. they are often used economically and only when necessary. more complicated logic is deployed in auxiliary. The auxiliary part can be a users desktop wallet or online service running on the server. Off-chain logic can also interact with other smart contracts or spend off-chain tokens. These interactions must still be authenticated by ON-CHAIN \\\\u200b\\\\u200blogic before they are executed on the Blockchain. they often have to follow rules and binding like on-chain logic.',\n",
       " ' such as signature requirements. hash function or value. Smart contracts are written in high -level languages. such as solidity or Vyper and are translated into byte code running on Ethereum (EVM) virtual machine. All nodes on the network must run the same smart contract code for all transactions related to smart contracts. only logic on-chain is processed by EVM. All the logic (logic) of the Ethereum Smart Contract must be determined in the contract and a transaction only needs to call those activities. A transaction may activate one or more functions or operations in smart contracts. depending on the data and the value it provides. Smart contracts then perform the functions or operations according to its logic and rules. and update the corresponding status. You can see it in the following image. Cardanos modular approach has some advantages compared to the monolithic approach of Ethereum in terms of expansion and expansion. A complex service can be created on Cardano for very low fees. Most functions can be performed off-chain and only the necessary parts on-chain. The smaller the cardano transaction. the smaller the fee. Off-chain fee of course may be significantly lower (or almost no if the user runs a local auxiliary program). all smart contract logics are executed on-chain. If the smart contract code is complex and large. it will automatically increase the ETH fee. Developers are forced to write small and simple contracts possible. They may tend to ignore some confirmation to perform cheaper individual activities. The complexity of the contract increases the fee. Cardanos module approach improves its expansion by reducing the load on the blockchain and allows the performance of smart contracts in parallel. Because most of the smart contract logic is executed off-chain. blockchain only has to verify on-chain code calls. helping to reduce calculation and storage requirements. Ethereums expansion is limited by its monolithic approach. which increases the blockchain load and prevents the implementation of smart contracts in parallel. Because all smart contract logics are executed on-chain. all nodes on the network must run all smart contract codes for all transactions related to it. this increases the calculation and storage requirements. because all transactions must be handled sequentially (shared global state). they can interfere with each other and create congestion or delay on treatment on the platform. Some people think that the fee market is the best solution to get a part of on-chain resources. while others believe that one day the blockchain will only be for the rich. I dare to say how to establish a reasonable fee policy is an unsolved topic. including Bitcoin transactions. If the on-chain service fee wants to be low and stable. it is necessary to solve the ability to expand. It is impossible to say clearly that Cardano or Ethereum better. Both platforms have advantages and disadvantages. What function they want to deploy and what specific platforms for them always depend on the group. Most users will always prefer the lowest possible fee for the best possible services.',\n",
       " ' Third -party developers must adapt to this and build applications that users want to use and are willing to pay. Paying 1 USD for a regular transaction and 5 USD to perform smart contracts is an unacceptable expensive price for most people. Technology development will need to be continued.August 30. I remember the time when Ethereum had a collage fee. Users are not ready to pay high fees. It is said that people will switch to Cardano and other platforms because it will be cheaper and trading will be faster. That happened a part. some users have moved to the second layer (layer 2) and remains in the Ethereum ecosystem. Will Defi on Cardano have the opportunity to fight the number of layers 2 increasing?. Low expansion is a problem for all blockchain and DEFI services. because the fee may be high and unpredictable. and no one can be sure when their transactions will be resolved. The network can only be used by rich people who are willing to pay for a block. This hinders the application. especially for the poor. It is true that unless the service is cheap. we will not see the widely applied. the Ethereum group has not solved the problem of low expansion of layer 1. that did not matter because Layer 2 saved the world. People take their ETH and move to layers 2 allows them to use similar services available on Ethereum. The user experience is great. The transactions are resolved quickly and above all cheap. Very quickly. many competitive layers began to appear. Today there are dozens of layers 2 and I fish you have never heard of many of them. the largest layers are known to everyone. They have a large number of users and TVL. It is likely that if DEFI on Cardano exists earlier than a year. today it will have more users and larger TVL. history cannot be changed. We have to think about whether the Cardano ecosystem can succeed in the competition of a large number of layers 2. Layer 2 solves the ability to expand but must pay for decentralization and security. The fact is that most layers 2 zero (or only partial) inherit decentralization and security from the first layer. Users have exchanged the comfort of users to get the features representing the meaning of the blockchain industry. If you look at the Layer 2 list and start researching one by one. you will encounter unwanted problems. if you think. like the author of the text. the decentralization and security are characteristics that help distinguish this area from the traditional banking system. the teams are aware of the problem and are trying to solve them. Layer 2 someday can be decentralized and safer. Positive news is that no Layer 2 is ready to apply mass at this time. Solving a decentralized problem in Layer 2 is a significant complex issue than expanding. I dont think Layer 2 basically threatens Cardanos success. even Cardano is not able to handle thousands of transactions per second at this time.',\n",
       " ' I find the future is still open and no one is sure to succeed. Everything can basically change within 5-10 years. people will continue to move from this layer 2 to another layer. Many layers 2 will disappear because of competition to overcome. It somewhat reminiscent of the ICO fever when many projects are created. but today only a few are left. Layer 2 has some basic problems that are difficult to solve. The decentralization must take place on the basis of expensive resources. It may be the ratio of hash or tokens. it may be other resources. such as drive capacity. but remove it aside. Layer 2 may have their own tokens. The decentralization of Layer 2 based on ETH is probably impossible. because most ETH will be in different places (including ETH Stake on layer 1) in the ecosystem and a single layer will only be protected by a small part of the total amount. Perhaps successful layers will tend to separate from Ethereum and escape from dependence on it. it will depend on how they solve their own decentralized and confidential problems. Ethereum is used as an executable layer and the data is available in good security data. Layer 2 basically performs some off-chain activities and uses Ethereum as a safer layer before attacks. in many cases. property on layer 2 is not well protected. Another problem with Layer 2 network is that they decay users and capital. I think there will not be many layers 2 but only a few can survive. Their tokens may be so valuable that they can build their own node network and ensure security. we still have a long way to achieve that. some models may be developed similar to the polkadot or cosmos ecosystem. It is important to realize that there is a battle between Layer 2 about users and capital. Not that Ethereum is competing with Cardano. but there is a war on the Ethereum ecosystem between layers 2. Cardano can be considered another competitive ecosystem. but somehow is outside Ethereum. This may be an advantage. The battle between layers 2 in the Ethereum ecosystem can be considered by some people to be chaotic. UX can disappoint many people. When you add to other current risks related to layer 2. the use of DEFI on Cardano can be a better choice. I personally think that Layer 1 has a good scale with the DEFI development ecosystem is a better solution for users than Layer 1 with many Layer 2 networks for users and capital. Users must be able to interact easily with each other through a single network or technology. This is the basis for building a large network effect. The division of users into different Childchaines will basically reduce the construction of network effects. I think the basic difference between Cardano and Ethereum is the accounting model. ie UTXO compared to the account -based model. The accounting model has a great impact on the operation of Ethereum (EVM) and Plutus platform.',\n",
       " ' I personally lost my faith in Ethereum. but mostly in EVM. because this execution model is one of the reasons why there are many hacks in the Ethereum ecosystem. I think the battle between the platforms is not only at an extension but also at reliability and anti -hacking capacity. Is it safe to build a safe layer if they need EVM to work? We do not know that yet. I feel from Layer 2 that they only solve the problem temporarily with high fees. The sending of the transaction and the implementation of the SC is done off-chain. off-chain activities still depend on the existence of layer 1. When you think about it from a wider angle. you will find that it is only an effort to change the entire Ethereums operation model. Ethereum has not been completed and any Layer 2 is the same. The groups in the ecosystem are seeking to achieve decentralization and high expansion. the original network design is changing. Instead of Sharding. the group is moving to a new model. Absolutely not sure that this is a good choice. The IOG group built something similar. with the difference that they thought more about the design so that they didnt have to change often. Cardano will expand very well in Layer 1 and will have a large number of layers 2 at the same time. The goal is that Cardano is still the center of everything. because Layer 1 is really necessary for the existence of layer 2. Layer 1 will depend on the cost to survive. Layer 1 must be economically sustainable. Layer 2 can be considered as the competition of layer 1. Ethereum has gone ahead in history and this is reflected in the number of users and TVL. But in my opinion. in terms of technology and protocol design. IOG has led. Layer 2 has so far helped keep users in the Ethereum ecosystem. but that does not mean that everything will continue. The Ethereum ecosystem has many problems with a low level of decentralization of layer 2 and a large number of hacks. If this is not resolved. Cardano still has a great chance to succeed with users mainly asking for a decentralized request and the sure that they will not lose money due to a large number of hacks. Layer 2 is confused and may not be trusted by newcomers. If DEFI on Cardano is provided through a single wallet and financial activities become more transparent. Cardano can succeed. along with other things. thanks to clearer UX. From a long -term perspective. it is necessary to think about the security budget. The success of Layer 2 is not economic danger for layer 1. Layer 2 escapes dependence on layer 1 can bring economic benefits. Layer 1 needs to be the best class in terms of technology in the ecosystem.August 29. All the registered Stake Ada will be able to vote in Catalyst Fund10 from August 31. Each management stage in Catalyst is a test that is ready for decentralized management and important feedback related to peoples interest in this form of decision.',\n",
       " ' The communitys evaluation and censorship phase has ended. On August 18. a Snapshot was made to calculate the voting rights of all voters registered in Catalyst Fund10. If you are not sure if you have registered properly or not. you can use this tool to verify. Let us remind you that anyone has at least 500 ADA (excluding stake rewards) in their wallet at the time of fast shooting can participate in voting. The governance period. which means the voting to see which project will receive funding. will start on August 31. Those who appear to be able to share their projects on social networks and receive the favor of the voter. The voter still has time to decide which project should support the power of their Token ADA. When this stage ends. the reward will be distributed to all voters. Those who do not re -register. this is a necessary condition to receive rewards. can still vote but have no right to receive rewards. After the governance stage ends and the reward is distributed. the final storage stage will take place. The interest of projects in receiving funding from Catalyst as well as the interest of the voter gradually increased. In Fund9.174 ideas were proposed and 354 thousand votes were abandoned. There are 1.472 ideas (in 13 challenges) in Fund10. Whether the votes are exceeded or not. they still have to check. We are in a market. But the Cardano communitys activity certainly did not slow down and still clearly saw the enthusiasm to build decentralized technologies. The success of Cardano project is in the hands of Ada holders. It is important to note that funding decisions for projects from Cardano budget are made. The community should choose projects with the most positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem with a reasonable budget. This is definitely not an easy option. I recommend that all voters should see more proposals and comments from the reviewers. Maybe you should vote in an area that you yourself understand. The vote ended on September 14. Voting will be anonymous. The voting right depends on the number of coins that the voter has in their wallet at the time of fast shooting. buying more ADA to gain additional voting rights is not meaningful. The results will be published after the voting ends. The 50 million ADA budget has been reserved for Fund10. Lets hope that the best projects will receive funding. See more instructions for registration and voting here. Lets find out and vote to support Fimis projects. Below is a list and links of Fimis proposals and partners. ———— Cooperation proposals —————.August 25. The number of Stake Cardano people has passed 1. Their number increased to several hundred daily. This seems to be a high or low number of people? Bitcoin is said to be the most decentralized network. compare the number of Stake Ada people with the number of operators in the Bitcoin network. You may be surprised to know that the number of Stake Ada people is more than the number of BTC operators.',\n",
       " ' Hard Fork Shelley took place in July 2020 and started Stake Ada on Cardano. 3 years 1 month has passed since this event. From Cardanos point of view. Stake started from Epoch 208. only 17.305 Stake Ada people. The 100k Stakers landmark was surpassed in December 2020 (Epoch 235). which is for 5 months. it was a price market. This has had a positive impact on the growth of the staker. In March 2021 (Epoch 251). Cardano has 300 thousand Stake people. In June 2021 (Epoch 270). this figure is more than 600k. The 1 million stakes milestone was overcome in December 2021 (Epoch 311). In just one year. 900 thousand people participated in Stake. The average daily average is 2.465 new stake people. the growth of new Stake people has slowed down. Cardano surpassed 1. 2 million staker in November 2022 (Epoch 374). We have reached the new ATH. which is 1. in August 2023 (Epoch 431). the average daily growth of the new Stake number was about 700. the average growth was about 200 new stake people every day. only about 50.000 Stake people joined Stake. the growth rate is 12 times slower than the price market. If the growth in the next growth market (2025) is similar to 2021. about 500 thousand to 1 million new Stake will be added to Stake. Cardano may have a total of about 2 million to 2. 5 million stake people at the end of 2025. The POS network has the advantage that every new user or owner of the DEFI (not all owners use DEFI) are potential Stake people. Economic incentives and cardano protocol are designed so that if you hold ADA. the stake they are also beneficial. the number of accounts valid for ADA is correlated with the number of Stake people. the number of accounts is 2. 35 million. This figure is about 1 million less than the number of Stake people. DEFI user growth will have a positive impact on the number of Stake people. the decentralization of Cardano. a part of ADA may be locked in the DEFI protocol (provide profit + stake reward). This can cause certain risks because many users can rely on a specific smart contract and may be hacked. The Stake Ada through centralized exchanges is similar (but less risky). It can be assumed that if the number of Stake people increases in the market price and the growth rate is significantly faster in the market price. the decentralization of Cardano will increase in the future. This only applies to the number of absolute stake people. it is necessary to take into account whales. a huge amount of ada. Stakers are not equal to each other. this should be taken into account. For the purpose of the article. we need to know that Cardano has 1. Different tools provide different information. and you can find 1. 29m or 1. 28m. Some tools display the number of stake people lower than a few 100k or more.',\n",
       " ' 3 million Stakers is the number taken from the new Explorer of Cardano Foundation. and trust it. 3m is a number that will not correspond to the only number of Stake people. An entity can have multiple stake accounts. Exchange will also have multiple accounts. we know that the two Stake accounts always authorize ADA to Pool Binance. and Binance may have several dozen accounts of them. Cardano may have about 1. 1 million to 1. 2 million stake people. Now lets think about it more or less. We can compare it to the Bitcoin network because it is considered the most decentralized. we are only interested in the number of authorized people (Stake people compared to the exploitation). We will not mention the number of block production nodes or other details. in the case of Bitcoin. the number of miners is not public. We know which pool creates blocks and in any ratio. but we dont know how many miners authorize the ratio of haveh for these pools. The recent ATH in the Bitcoin network in terms of hash ratio is about 445 million years/s. We will try to calculate how much ASIC to provide this hash ratio. we will try to reveal how many Asic in the hands of the unique miners. you can see some popular ASIC devices today. including their buying price (we have found the lowest possible purchase price) and performance. there are more Asic on the market with very similar parameters. we do not know what the individual ASIC ratio is used by the miners. The most effective exploitation can force miners to change ASIC regularly. We think that the less effective old Asic will be shown at a lower level. Suppose that large mining companies have more modern ASIC. If we get data from the table above. we can easily calculate how much ASIC to provide 445 million has been chopped/s. if all the miners use Antminer S19 XP Hyd. we will need 1. 7 million devices. if they use Antminer T19. it will be 5. 3 million devices. We know that Antminer S19 Pro is a popular ASIC device. consider that there should be 4m ASIC device to achieve the current bitcoin hash ratio. the number may vary. They can be ASIC 3M or 6M device. Lets assume that we are approaching reality. please note that the cost of buying in bulk Asic. Asics cost is significantly higher than the energy cost in the context of a 51% attack on Bitcoin. Now the most difficult part. It is estimated how many large. medium and single exploitation tools. A study since 2021. among other studies related to the concentration of the hash ratio in the Bitcoin network. can help us search. Research conclusions are as follows:. The total minner is only about 50k. If we compare the research results with our tables. about 2 million ASIC devices are controlled by 50 major mining companies. This means that about 2m ASIC is in the hands of medium miners and single miners.',\n",
       " ' this study was old and the market price had a negative impact on the miners. Try to find some more data. Marathon Digital Holdings. one of the largest US mining companies. has the hash rate about 17. 7 EH/s and wants to increase to 23. 3 EH/s by the end of this year. Suppose that the ASIC device is 100 years old and counts the number of devices used by marathons. Marathon has 177k ASIC devices and wants 230k at the end of 2023. a mining company may have 5% market share in the total hash ratio. its easy to believe that a few dozen similar companies can control more than half of the total hash ratio. There are a number of major mining companies on the market that are quickly increasing their market share in the total hash rates. These companies are pushing medium -sized mining companies but mainly out of the market. assume that the top 50 mining companies can control the hash ratio of about 65% by 2023. For ASIC devices. it will be 2. only 1. 4 million ASIC for medium and single operating machines. It should be realized that the trend of concentration will not stop. we can observe the process of focusing gradually since the first ASIC devices appeared on the market. it is fair to assume that the proportion of large mining companies has increased by 5-20% in the market price. because we know that some mining companies have bankrupt. It is likely that large mining companies are removing medium -sized mining companies. and at the same time. the medium -sized mining companies are pushing individual mining companies out of mining activities. The largest exploitation tool may have more than 200.000 ASICs. and smaller tools may have an average of about 50. The average exploitation tool may have ASIC from 1k to 10k. How many medium miners may have?. If there are 200 of them and each person has an average of 1000 ASIC. they will control 200.000 ASIC together. There may be an average number of operating machines at least 10 times more than the large number of operating machines. Consider the average 500 minner with an average of 2000 ASIC. They will control 1 million ASIC together. These numbers mean only 400 thousand minner. It is still a very positive figure in the context of the research mentioned above. bringing the total minner only at 50k. I guess there are tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of medium -sized minner. Some of them can only work. such as dozens or hundreds of ASIC. I dare to say that running an ASIC is almost unworthy. because it is necessary to find a suitable place for indoor equipment. ASIC is very noisy and needs good cooling. If we consider the exploitation only worth it if someone has at least 10 ASICs. there will be about 140.000 medium -sized operators. This figure is close to the 50K figure reported in the study. The total number of miners in Bitcoin network is at least 50k.',\n",
       " ' If we acknowledge that this study is incorrect. we can still believe that some large mining companies have more than 50% of the total Asic in the network. If there is no medium miner and all others are single minner. there will be 2m. Obviously this assumption is wrong. It is very likely that there are about 50k to 200k mining tools in the Bitcoin network. I believe there may be 500 thousand minner. but this number is very unlikely. Based on the figures mentioned above. it seems that the number of Stake Ada people is 6 to 24 times more than the BTC operator. It should be emphasized that we have compared the total number of entrusters. This speaks very little about decentralization. because we have to consider sharks. We only do this in the case of Bitcoin because we need to find the total number of operators. the investors distributing ADA for many Stake accounts is meaningless. It is likely that a few stake people will do this if they want to authorize many pools. I dont think any entity wants to authorize 10 pools. running multiple ASIC devices is reasonable. it will be very reasonable when trying to count how many exploitation machines really exist if we want to compare the number of Stake people and the number of exploits. an entity can hold ADA in many wallets. The reality (but unlikely) is an entity that can control 50% of the total ADA through a large number of addresses. We can explore the list of rich people Cardano. If we assume that each address belongs to a single entity. we see that the top 100 holders have only 20% of ADA control. this is a significant better result than the case of Bitcoin. where 50 minner controls more than half of the hash ratio. To say this will definitely need to analyze more deeply. It should be realized that if an entity controls more than half of the resources (tokens or the hash ratio). then how many people authorize to hold the remaining 50% are not important. There may be 10 million or even 100 million authorities. but a single entity will take control of the network. In the long -term context. the trend is important. decentralization should increase over time. not decrease. we observe the gradual concentration. This is reasonable because big players have the advantage of scale and can push each other out of business operations. participating in exploitation activities requires high input costs. Stake is more comprehensive. so it is likely that the decentralization of the POS network. will grow over time as Stake is becoming more and more popular. The number of Stake people in Cardano network has been constantly increasing in the past 3 years and we have not recorded any decline. It is expected that the number of Stake accounts in the case of many POS networks will be higher than the number of ASIC devices in the Bitcoin network in the near future.',\n",
       " ' There may be errors in our estimates because some information is hard to find or difficult to verify. This is especially true for Bitcoin. Pools do not reveal how many people mate the hash ratio for them. Cardano is more transparent on this issue. but in a decentralized context. the number of Stake accounts may be misleading. Surely dont be afraid to comment on our conclusions and give us information that can help adjust our estimates. Our goal is not to ask questions about the quality of other projects. but to prove that the development of new technologies is meaningful and can improve decentralized quality. we want to provide more context for numbers. It is important that people recognize Cardano compared to other projects.August 24. there was a Hard Fork Shelley starting Stake on Cardano. Stake on Cardano celebrates the 3rd birthday. See what this means for the project. Hard Fork Shelley mainly shows a major change in the decentralized process of Cardano network. I dare to say it is also a big change for the blockchain industry. Although some blockchain use the Proof-of-Stake consensus (POS) that runs in 2020. such as Algorand was launched in June 2019. POS is still an unused young algorithm that has been tested over time. Having a blockchain is different from the unique POS deployment that can certainly be considered a technological progress. Cardanos POS is based on Nakamotos consensus with probability transactions. so it works completely different from Algorands POS. In September 2022. Ethereum 2. 0 was launched. bringing another unique POS consensus. If we look at history. we will see that the oldest blockchain to implement POS is pure NXT platform. launched in 2013 and is still active to this day. Hard Fork Shelley is one of the largest events in 2020. because Cardano has been in the top 10 since 2017. Cardano is the first major blockchain to switch to POS consensus mechanism (including Stake and Operating Node Mass production). Remember that at that time Bitcoin. Bitcoin SV and Litecoin were in the top 10. All of these projects use Proof-of-Work. Then Ripple and Binance Chain. There is no Blockchain POS in the top 10. Cardano is the first Blockchain POS in the top 10 to give everyone the ability to Stake Token. Ada holders can participate in the decentralized and network security process they begin to receive Stake prizes every 5 days. Stake can be considered similar to mining. Anyone who is interested in providing services to the network and receiving rewards can freely participate in Stake and exploit. Blockchain decentralization and security depend on the number of people who will participate in Stake or exploit and what individual entities will have. Cardano does not determine the minimum number of ADA you must have to join Stake. In the literal sense. anyone who has a few dollars can participate. Nearly 1. 3 million people have participated in Stake from 2020 to the present. It is an average of about 1.',\n",
       " '180 people a day. In the downward market. there are hundreds of Stake participants in Cardano every day. someone can leave Stake and others. It is important that the number of staker is constantly increasing. Stake people can authorize about 1.100 groups to produce at least 1 block per era and are eligible for rewards. There are several multi -group operators in the network. but Cardano is one of the most decentralized networks in the blockchain industry in terms of the number of block manufacturers. Cardano is the Top 10 project. so the driving force of cyber attack is huge. The attack efforts occur all the time. as well as all the large blockchain networks. Cardanos POS has passed an important time test because 3 years is a relatively long time. Cardano network has never had a serious incident at a consensus level and has never had a case of restarting the network. This also applies to the network upgrade processed by the Hard Fork complex. Even in these cases. users will not notice any slow or limited use in network use. There is only one event in which 50% of the nodes reboot at a time. Nothing happens and this only happens within minutes. the network can create regular blocks. The network has proven its strong self -recovery. I remember in 2017 it was said that the POS network could not work safely. many people still do not believe in the consensus of POS. Today is different. Evidence is considered a safe and tested consensus over time. Looking at the Top 10. you will see Bitcoin and Dogecoin are the last projects that use Proof-of-Work. Ethereum and other projects are ranked according to the market limit using replacement consensus (not necessarily POS. but not POW). It is important to note that Ada is in the hands of everyone. The group IOG. Cardano Foundation and Emurgo also holds ADA. but most of the money is in the hands of Ada holders. nearly 78% of the total 45.000 tokens are being circulated. No entity can control the decentralized consent of the network suddenly. Some tokens are held by their own commitments and the total number of shares of groups includes the authorization of tokens from many Stake people (usually thousands of people who authorize a regular group). A certain danger to the POS network is the high concentration of tokens in one place (on the exchanges. in the monitoring bank. in smart contracts. Cardano features a high liquidity stake so people can authorize ADA directly from their wallets. No third party needs to be used. This is one of the great advantages compared to competitive POS projects. where we can observe the high concentration of tokens. smart exchanges or contracts that people use because Stake Token is easier. It can be said that in this view. Cardano network appears as one of the safer alternatives. Those who present that POS will never work wrong. Those who do not believe in the POS network even can even wait for another or two years.',\n",
       " ' But the fact that no POS network has been hacked. at least according to my knowledge. Proof-of-work will forever be a consensus that is tested over time for reasonable reasons. we are currently witnessing. the POW network tends to be concentrated. They usually only have some block manufacturers and most of the hash ratio is made up of large mining companies. People began to doubt the long -term economic sustainability of the POW network. The POS network is much more covered than the POW network. and they can be more decentralized. they are much more energy -saving. so the transaction fee can be easier to maintain them more economically. POS consensus is definitely a technology suitable for our decentralized future. Pows consensus certainly has many advantages. but must recognize some clear issues. there are many ways to deploy different POW protocols basically the same as the way to deploy different POS protocols. Blockchain results are made up of subtle details. Cardano is definitely a successful project in terms of Proof-of-Stake consensus. We have looked back at the past and the present to be able to think about the future of Cardano. A decentralization seems to be on the right track. The important thing to be solved is the ability to expand. Do not sacrifice decentralization when trying to increase expansion. It is a big problem of technology to be solved. The IOG group has presented a plan to increase Cardanos expansion through POS Leios consensus (Input Endoser). The deployment will be complicated but the IOG group has proven that they have the ability to innovate and provide even such complex technologies. POS Leios is not the only change that Cardano can see at a consensus level and there are other things being implemented. POS certainly has more to provide.August 22. The decentralization of blockchain networks is based on two pillars: people who run adequate nodes have the control of the production of blocks. Pool has Cardano source control. we will explore the first pillar. We will explain the common and less known requirements for blockchain decentralization and put it in the context with Cardano. clarify some requirements for decentralized networks. A network can only be considered decentralized if these requirements are met. We will explain the commonly known requirements. as well as the lessons mentioned and basically can affect the overall results. there is no central apparatus that controls access to the system. The system must be opened for all. Everyone is free to participate and can freely leave at any time. This is applied to users as well as those who want to receive rewards from the network for providing the necessary services for the network. block manufacturers and authorized people mainly play an important role. In an ideal world. users will choose a blockchain based on decentralization. many other factors will affect success. Everyone must be able to get. under the same conditions. an expensive resource (original token. hash ratio. ) that the network is decentralized around. Cryptos high fluctuations and the market price growth of the projects principal can benefit early participants.',\n",
       " ' Anyone who owns the necessary amount of resources can become a block manufacturer or authorized person. The decentralization of most blockchain networks is based on owning a certain expensive resource. This is why it is impossible to guarantee equality between block manufacturers. Anyone who owns more resources. whether purchased with their money or through authorization. can create more blocks. This inequality is also shown at the level of representative. Anyone who can get more expensive resources can be delegated and thus receives a larger reward from the system. If you want to achieve the openness of the system (without verifying the identity of the registered person). the equality cannot be guaranteed. Money can buy more solid location in the open system. it is impossible to prevent anyone from gaining a dominant position. Economic encouragement measures to promote the entity trying to receive greater rewards. this unfortunately reduces equality. thus reducing the decentralization and security of the network. It is important to realize that greed is the motivation to motivate people to participate in decentralization. The decentralized network gives people the opportunity to improve their living conditions. This is also the reason why decentralized participation has become a business activity for successful projects. It is important to make this business reach people as long as possible (ideal forever). Manufacturers and block authorization are subject to decentralized network. If someone controls the dominant amount of resources (more than 1/2 or 1/3). they will become the system dominant. the system is no longer decentralized. The only way to defend against the appearance of a dominant entity is that it includes. the lowest cost can allow many people to participate in the decentralized process of the system. The fact that a entity gained the right to dominate by buying a resource must certainly cost that unimaginable. The more decentralized participants. the harder it is to gain the right to dominate because it is the battle for resources. You may be surprised that decentralization is protected (to a certain extent) by the network effect (the number of users and acceptance). the participation and the loyalty of the community as well as the confidence in the future of the project. it can be described as a social class. The increasing application of applications motivates people to participate in the success of the network. In the case of Blockchain. this means buying native. Stake them (only POS network). participating in voting and the ability to receive rewards when participating in decentralized (Stake. exploitation). The economic and social importance of blockchain projects is expected to increase over time. Now we are still at the beginning. It is important to ensure that decentralized (security and other properties) are guaranteed mainly in the event of a noticeable growth of the importance of blockchain. This will be a dynamic process gradually. With the growing importance of blockchain. the desire to control them of different entities will increase. for reasons to achieve higher rewards (greed) or for power (political. the conflict between blockchain projects may make sense to you.',\n",
       " ' because in a way. it is a battle for decentralization and security. Network effects naturally make the perpetual more expensive. This increases the reward but also increases the defense of the possibility of dominating. Note that the defense of the appearance of a dominant entity (dominant) is similar to the defense before the 51%attack. If the ability to participate in decentralized network is exclusive. ie expensive or even impossible for a certain position (the main application for the POW network). the system will be aimed at concentration. The decline of the system decreases as there are fewer people involved in it. When participants decline. the power of larger entities often increases. It may be an advantage for the system if it can own a small part of resources and entrust it for another entity. Most people (authorized people) authorize resources for block manufacturers (Pool/confirmed). the authorized person must have the control of resources (separate courses or ASIC exploitation tools + energy) and may authorize that resource to other entities at any time. we are talking about direct authorization. There is also a form of indirect authorization in which the owner of the resource abandoned the control of resources. Loss of control occurs when the person pays the resources without direct control of such resources and the third party may use the wrong purpose or lose resources for some reason. resources may easily be abused. Indirect authorization refers to Stake from centralized exchanges. exploited on cloud platforms. Focusing resources is always a risk. It will make a difference if the entity gains the right to dominate by owning the necessary amount of resources or if the power is at least partially authorized. In case of authorization. maybe the authorized people will support another entity and thus weaken the position of the entity that violates the social contract. The more resources in the hands of the authorities are. the weaker the position of the block producer. One of the other factors that affects the quality of decentralized decentralization is the ability to maintain its position and not being compete to push out. This is one of the biggest differences between POS and POW networks. Although many POS projects allow you to maintain your own power position through ownership of money. in POW networks there is competition between miners. Large mining companies tend to have advantages due to their size (economic efficiency on a scale) and can easily push smaller mining companies out of the system. POW mining is an exclusive business activity. Many Blockchain Pow tends to become more focused as those who exploit the smaller preferences leave. The transparency is also an important requirement for a decentralized network. Although this feature is not always desired. especially related to the privacy of transactions. it will be beneficial when being able to verify the behavior and status of each participant. Must be able to verify the behavior of each agent and whether they perform their role in the system as expected or not.',\n",
       " ' The decentralized network must be opened. without being licensed and transparent. Because it is impossible to guarantee the equality between the block manufacturer and the authorized person. the network must be comprehensive and transparent. Systems that have the ability to direct resources may have an advantage. Letogling is protected by social class. When the economic and social importance of Blockchain increases. its decentralization must also increase. Network dominance pressure may be higher today. Cardano is decentralized around the Ada token. ADA is a finite resource. cannot be regenerated and scarce. The number of ADA is limited to 45. about 35 billion tokens are circulating. about 8. 9 billion tokens reserve (will be gradually issued through the Stake reward) and more than 1. 3 billion tokens in Cardano budget. Cardano is a decentralized network without any central apparatus with control. Cardano is owned by all ADA holders. ADA ownership is shown by owning a separate course that allows for money spending. but also creates a certificate to register the Stake and Pool addresses. as well as to authorize Stake. The distribution of ADA. as well as all certificates (including history). is stored on Cardano blockchaino. Anyone can verify it at any time. Cardano basically undertakes its own decentralization. as it is not limited to anyone in the interaction process and is available to all those who have access to the Internet. Anyone can buy ADA and do not need a third party permission. create a certificate and send that certificate to Blockchain. anyone can become a Pool or Stake operator. Cardano (source code in the workstation) cannot limit anyone in this.100 pool created at least one block in each era (and eligible for rewards) and nearly 1. Pool operators (block manufacturers) can automatically decide which workstation version will be installed on their node. This is the connection between the first and second pillars of decentralization. Pool IOG is responsible for providing Cardano guest application. but the network update cannot be created unless there is enough to operate the pool agree with changes. the amount of stake is large enough to agree. to a certain extent. the authorized person must also agree with the network upgrade. Cardano is built intentionally to maintain the most comprehensive possible. support directly authorized without the third party. there is no minimum determined for Stake Ada and low transaction fees even when sending certificates. all the user of Cardano network must currently hold ADA. and they may be Stake (meaning the active owner of the network). Although this can change after introducing Babel fee and users will be able to pay for transaction fees via token (Stablecoin. the possibility of becoming an investor will still be an attractive and affordable choice. The important thing is. Stake people can easily create authorized certificates from their wallets and keep ADA under direct control. They can change representatives at any time. If you own a stake in Cardano network. you will never lose it as long as you have your ada.',\n",
       " ' No one can push you out of the business model. Even if the importance of the network increases by 10 times. the number of Stake people may increase. The fact that large organizations get larger stakes in the network can be economically expensive because there will always be a large number of small parties. the Pool operator can become anyone who can run their own node and create a pair of certificates. namely the Pool registration and operating key certificate. a pool can be elected as a slot leader. the right to create a block. only when the pool has enough stake. In order for a pool to cast a block in each era and thus ensure the reward for the pool operator and the Stake people who authorize this pool. that pool needs to have a stake amount of about 3-5 million ADA. Cardano has a unique mechanism that prevents Stake pools from surpassing a limit. This is called saturation point. Pools Stake is limited by the protocol and if it exceeds the saturation point. it will receive less average rewards. This is to motivate Stake people to authorize another pool. the saturation point was more than 72 million VND ADA. A single entity can also operate multiple pools. This inequality cannot be prevented because it will violate the openness. Some third parties will have to verify the true identities of the operating operators and they can still rent white horses. The saturated mechanism has a psychological effect that makes many people operate pool easily find and label. It is possible that a entity will operate multiple pools under a different Stake code. so at first glance it is impossible to recognize it is the operator of many pool (MPO). This can happen (and may be one of the attack vectors). but it may be more complicated in receiving authorization. Pool operators are often the units checked over time with good monitoring proposals. There is a relatively large number of multi -pool operators in the Cardano ecosystem. and it is impossible to say that one of them is dominant. The largest multi -pool operator is Avengers at 6. There are several tens of mpo so the diversity is still relatively high. Some MPO owns a large number of ADA. but in many cases. ADA is authorized. MPO. as well as single pool operators (SPO). are economically promoted to behave honestly. Participants can authorize elsewhere at any time in case of any doubts. Cardano network is comprehensive and allows people to actively participate in decentralized and earn rewards. Interactive ability can play an important role in application. receives regular rewards from the network. can be considered a standard financial option to ensure passive income. this will only happen if the economic and social importance of the network is increasing. The success of the network largely depends on the dominance of technology. ie the ability to expand. utility. second class. pool and community are extremely important to succeed. The first user of the DEFI ecosystem is recruited from the community and their social interaction on social networks attracts newcomers to the system.',\n",
       " ' Teams often have a very important role. Without innovation. maintenance and solving current problems. technological dominance cannot be achieved. The communitys belief in pool is very important in the context of building trust in the project. If Cardano succeeds and the network effects grow. it is likely that the decentralization of the network will also increase. because a significant part of users will also own ADA and become a Stake. the market price requirements of resources increased along with the network application that is met in the case of Cardano. All small and large entities are looking for Stake in Cardano network to compete to get a limited scarcity of resources with very low inflation. The existing SPO and MPO continue to believe in the success of the project and their pool operation. the new entity will be difficult to establish. It should be noted that this is also applied to small spo. which can be difficult to set itself. to have enough stake to produce normal blocks. Blockchain decentralization can easily quantify through the number of block manufacturers and authorized people. this is not enough and need to check each part of the details. This is much harder to quantify. A decentralized quality is not only affected by protocols (source code and incentives) but also many other factors such as faith in the pool. belief in the success of the project. usefulness. regulation. We can talk about indirect effects or characteristics that affect decentralization. It is important to attract the largest number of participants as possible. who can participate in a decentralization easily and cheap. It is the mutual impact of economic drivers and beliefs. The offer is set by the protocol. Everything else depends on the social class. No one can turn/stop the cardano network. It is impossible to order any central entity to do so. The network controls a large number of people holding ADA and they do not depend on any third party. Can attack network without having to hold resources. the management apparatus can search for entities such as block manufacturers and make requests for them. it is important that there are as many block manufacturers as possible in the system. the mass production function can be easily moved to another place or giving up. It would not be good if block manufacturers (along with authorized people) were forced to comply with the regulations. there will always be a part that does not comply for thought reasons. we do not talk about administration and the role of pool in a decentralized system. This pillar is extremely important and will become more important if the application of blockchain technology is growing. The pools do not (should not) have significant stakes in the production of blocks. but they are in charge of the protocol source code (rules) and significantly affect the social floor. Need to focus on transparency. On-chain administration can significantly limit the influence of a pool and make that pool basically become a paid waiter of the community.',\n",
       " 'August 17. The management agencies are interested in how to rationally adjust the blockchain industry. They try to have at least part of control of how people use decentralized networks. Cardano features original assets (native assets). No third party can prevent Cardano users from using their assets in any way. Great. But is this really the best way to the projects success?. most people only hear about crypto and have not used or plan to work with them. We do not know what the user will have for the operation of decentralized services. It will be a decentralization. sure if they do not violate the law. or economic encouragement? It will most likely be a combination of many features. Most likely we will find out soon. Good news is that there is a gradual convergence between the blockchain industry and the traditional financial market. this will also attract the attention of the management agencies. which are not consistent with decentralized principles. It is difficult to estimate how administrative regulations can change the blockchain industry. Should Blockchain industry meet the needs of regulatory agencies or management agencies should adapt to decentralized principles?. If you think you know the answer. wait a while longer. The answer may not always be completely clear. If the Blockchain project complies with the regulations. the application may soar. Investors can buy the projects perpetual rates legally. Users can use DEFI. Banks and companies can start building new services on such a blockchain. If a project does not comply with the regulations. it may be slower and more difficult. Every technology needs users. Blockchain network will only be economically sustainable in the long term if people pay the use fee. Application within a few decades is essential for the success of Blockchain. A blockchain is not used by millions of people every day will soon collapse. possibly due to low security and decentralization. The consistency with decentralized principles and is not ready to comply with the requirements of countries can be considered a struggle for the right thing. What has the power to change the world is nothing more than decentralization. the autonomous algorithms in their behavior cannot change. unable to censorship. the right to use the service without permission and the same things cannot be guaranteed today through the architecture of the workstation and the owner. the battle for a better world has its limits and it is mainly the long -term economic sustainability of the blockchain. Everyone must want to change the world and start actively using blockchain services. And not only that. at least they have to understand to some extent the basic principles of decentralization and the right to supervise must be the default choice for them. Serious communication and peer -to -peer network (P2P) are the top priority of the IOG group. Original assets are an example besides the high decentralization of Cardano network. It can be said that Cardano is following a more difficult path to succeed. The indigenous property separates the issuer from the token owner.',\n",
       " ' The token publisher cannot restrict the owner of the token token that he has released in any way. Token owners can use tokens at any time according to their wishes. If you have the original token in your own cardano wallet. their attributes are very similar to the properties of the ADA. this feature is great. someone can consider it a limitation. Cardano token is less programmed while Ethereums tokens can do more. The lower programming ability of tokens basically prevent the act of allowing the publisher to comply with legal regulations. If regulatory agencies in the United States only allow USD to be encrypted on the blockchain if the publisher can censor transactions or freeze accounts. this means no one can cast Stablecoin supported by USD on Cardano legally. I believe that in the near future. people will send Stablecoin and other tokens through the Blockchain network (and L2 network) more than the indigenous crypto (due to vulnerability). Cardano may cost waste while other networks can develop prosperously. Can Ethereum be considered as a project that cannot stand the pressure from the decentralized management and sacrifices to achieve commercial success? It can be said that Ethereum is basically just a better database because the token publisher can retain control of stablecoin similar to the banking system? No. its not so simple. Ethereum provides higher token programming capabilities. This will help create such tokens that the publisher will not have any control over their transfer. Ethereum allows creating tokens with the same characteristics as cardano. It is impossible to say that Ethereum is worse because it is more popular. Ethereum will allow creating tokens to comply with legal regulations. but there are also tokens respect decentralized principles. This can serve different groups of users. beneficial for application. It is also possible to add function to Cardano to allow token to approve smart contracts. The token publisher may have the same control over tokens as in the case of ERC-20 token. But the question is. should Cardano follow this path?. A decentralization only makes sense if it allows users to interact on peer. If there is any intermediaries between Alice and Bob. namely the token publisher (smart contract deployer). then decentralized networks lack their main purpose of existence. My concern is that if a Blockchain project allows token to comply with the regulations. then people will accept them to a much greater level than decentralized alternatives. Although I think that all projects gathered sooner or later collapsed for a number of reasons (higher fees. abusing the power of intermediaries. it may take a long time. Cardano should never compromise with decentralized principles. Even with the current price. it is impossible to issue stablecoin supported by USD on Cardano. There are other options. Someone can persuade regulators to allow Stablecoin to exist on Cardano. it will be a victory. because the original property will always have a lower fee than the token (issued by smart contract). their transfer is controlled by smart contracts.',\n",
       " ' We will see if the Emurgo (USDA) or Mehen project (USDM) is successful. Another option to receive stablecoin supported by USD on Cardano is through bridges or projects like Indigo. We must not forget Stablecoin DJED is mortgaged exceeding the level. We can find many types of stablecoin in our ecosystem. Cardano does not allow Tether and Circle to cast USDT and USDC directly on Blockchain. But I dont think it is necessary if we can have these stablecoins through bridges. The problem of the bridge can also cause a certain risk. but it is mainly technology. Sooner or later there will be decentralized and reliable bridges. I do not think Tether. Paypal and other companies can ensure that their stablecoin is not used in other ecosystems and the second layer without their consent (ie the ability to control them). Lets wait and see how this option develops. Cardano can be one of the few blockchains that if you have stablecoin in your wallet. no one can take them from you or limit your use. This is a revolution. Not Stablecoin is controlled by Tether and Circle. It is difficult to build decentralized networks. The construction of DEFI services is even more complicated. There is no use of making such a great effort so that the final organizations can keep the control of users assets through smart contracts or block manufacturers. Blockchain and DEFI must make a difference with traditional banking services and this can be done through a single feature. which is decentralized. Thats why I think Cardano is on the right track. Let the management agencies understand the original assets and adjust the rules accordingly or find other ways. I consider indigenous assets as one of the important and underestimating advantages of Cardano. because they combine decentralized with the effectiveness of sending tokens. There is no form of sending tokens more effectively directly at the protocol level without using smart contracts. it is necessary to achieve meaningful tokens on Cardano and Stablecoin as the best we can have.August 16. Imagine a situation where someone has an infinite source of money and is willing to spend it to attack blockchain networks. The question is that such an attack will cost?. The security of decentralized networks is based on a scarce resource. This resource is expected to have a high market price. It will be very expensive for an individual to get a large part of resources. it is expected that that resource will be distributed to the maximum number of independent individuals possible. Distributing resources is very important to the network because if a significant amount of resources is owned by an entity (or several entities). then they will have the right to control the network. The principle behind the 51% attack was the attacker trying to take a larger amount of resources than all others combined. If the attacker successfully. he will win the dominant position and create most of the blocks in the network. The amount of resources is sufficient for the attacker to gain control of blockchain changes based on the consensus of the network.',\n",
       " ' For Cardano and Bitcoin. the attacker needs more than half of resources. But in the case of Ethereum. just more than one -third of resources are sufficient to break the consensus. To attack Cardano. the attacker needs more than 50% of the money ADA. Ada money is a finite digital resource and cannot be reproduced with a certain market price. The scarcity can play a role in the attack. because the higher demand increases market prices. If the attacker tries to buy a large amount of money in a short period of time. ADAs market price will skyrocket. This increase can attract attention from other buyers. so it will continue to push market prices up. This will increase the cost of the attack. once the attacker gets more than half of the ADA. the defensive army will not be able to take resources anywhere else. the attacker gained permanent control over the network. To attack Bitcoin. the attacker needs to receive more than 50% of the hashing Power. The hash ratio can be achieved by buying ASIC hardware consumes electricity. Both hardware and electricity have certain market prices and are regenerated resources. In different places in the world. these resources may have different market prices. And in particular. these resources are easy to get discounted when buying larger quantities. If the attacker gained the advantage. the defense still had the opportunity to try to win more resources to increase the defensive capacity. as both hardware and energy were theoretical resources theoretically. The attacker is not sure if he will have a permanent advantage or not. The attacker needs to receive more than half of the money currently being stake. more than 22. 7 billion ADA was stake in Cardanos consensus. The attacker needs more than 11. 36 billion dong ADA. The current market price of ADA is 0. 29 USD. the minimum cost of the attack is US $ 3. 3 billion. See how the cost of the attack increases with ADAs market price growth. assuming that about 11 billion ADA is permanently stake. Cardano attack costs are relatively low because we are at the bottom of the market. It is important to note that this is the minimum cost. The sudden demand will begin to push ADAs market price higher. If the attacker starts to buy at $ 0. then somewhere in this process (or at the end of the purchase). the market price will easily increase to $ 5. If the attacker tries to buy enough quantities. such as the last 1 billion ADA. then that amount will be equivalent to about 5 USD ratio. The attacker can be smarter and quickly spread transactions to buy for a longer period of time. he will be very adventurous because the market price may increase later. ADAs market price will not decrease to the current minimum (because someone continues to buy in). Please add that in the final market. by 2020. the lowest value of the ADA copper on the market is 0.',\n",
       " ' 03 USD. in the current market. the value is 10 times higher than the final market. When ADAs market price maintains over 1 USD. the minimum cost of a attack will range from tens to hundreds of billion dollars. This is also applied for ADA purchase slowly for a long time. which will not significantly increase market prices. The calculation of the cost of a Bitcoin attack is relatively difficult. but can be done. it will be necessary to rely on preliminary estimates. The result will not be exact as in the case of Cardano when it only needs to multiply the market price of ADA with the amount of money needed for the attack to get a minimum cost for the attack. The market price of Token ADA is the same in everywhere in the world. it is more complicated. because the cost of ASIC hardware and electricity varies between countries. It is very difficult to estimate how long the attacker will take to get the number of necessary ASIC exploitation tools and the attacker can receive a discount from the manufacturer. It is not necessary to buy new hardware for the attack. because the attack lasts only a few days or weeks. certainly not a few months. It will be more beneficial for the attacker when buying older parts from big miners. Areas such as China. Russia and the United States are the most suitable place to attack because electricity in these locations is quite cheap. Hardware manipulation and large demand for camping camps are another barrier for the attack. but for the attacker. according to our calculations with the infinite number of identifiers. this is not a problem. Bitcoin mining is concentrated and operated by public trading companies. It may be the most beneficial for the attacker when buying a few major mining companies at the same time. This will eliminate a lot of danger. The attacker can be honest and exploit BTC before starting the attack. This will give him more money to attack and time to buy more equipment or mining companies. We will not go into more tactics. Similar to Cardano. attackers need to be smart if they want to reduce costs for an attack. Look at the numbers. the hash ratio of Bitcoin is 445. 35 million VND/s (445 EH/s). 1 eH/s (1m th/s) will create 10.000 ASIC exploitation tools with a capacity of 100 months/s. ASIC exploitation tools will be required with 100 -year -sen power to achieve the current bitcoin hash ratio. Consider a few common exploitation tools on the market. their performance and consumption. In the next table. you can see the minimum number of needed to get the attacker to achieve the current ratio of Bitcoin and the total cost of acquisition. We have taken into account the usual market cost for each piece. As we mentioned. the attacker will not need to buy a new hardware. and consider this to be the maximum cost possible. remember that manufacturers can take a long time to distribute many of them.',\n",
       " ' Another number that we need to know is the average energy cost in different countries around the world. In the table. you can find Bitcoin mining countries. you can see energy costs for an attack in a day. To calculate. we assume that the average ASIC exploitation tool has a daily consumption of 90 kW and requires about 3.800.000 machines to attack. We have taken energy costs from the previous table from the business column. We believe that in many cases. miners can negotiate more beneficial terms. The current market price of BTC is 29.300 USD. About 900 Bitcoin is exploited every day. creating a total value of 26. 3 million USD. the exploitation will only be rewarded in Kazakhstan. we think that mining companies (especially large companies) have negotiated more beneficial terms with energy suppliers compared to the terms presented in the table above. in China. it will be worth the operators according to their interests. because energy shipments are very convenient. Bitcoins daily security budget is currently about $ 30 million. This is not even a percentage of the cost of buying ASIC exploitation tools. Attacking Bitcoin for a whole month will cost about 900 million USD of electricity. If we consider the cost of the attack of the attack. the minimum cost for Cardano is US $ 3. 3 billion while Bitcoin is about US $ 6. 66 billion (hardware + energy). Bitcoin attack is about 2 times more expensive. But it was a simple thinking. it is only a minimum cost possible. assuming that ADAs market price will not increase when the demand for money increases. we reviewed the cost of acquisition of new ASIC exploitation tools. I am sure that the attacker can significantly reduce costs by buying older parts. such as half or possibly ⅔. The cost of an attack on both networks may be similar. we have ignored the cost of renting. cooling. transporting hardware. staff. I dont think these costs will be significant in the context of hardware and energy purchase costs. Cardano attacks more easily in terms of this. as it can be done by a single person with computers connected to Internet and bank accounts. When compared. it is good to notice other aspects. The market capitalization of Bitcoin is US $ 571 billion. while Cardano is 10 billion USD. Cardanos market capitalization is 57 times lower than Bitcoin. while the attack costs are similar. Bitcoin is a more important financial and social asset. and its security must be significantly higher than its competitors. we do not observe this difference. If Cardanos financial and social importance increases (it will be close to Bitcoin and Ethereum). it is likely that the market capitalization will also increase and lead to the cost for a possible attack. There are currently 25. 5 million ETH placed in Ethereum. 1/3 of that money multiplied by the market price of ETH (US $ 1800) will produce US $ 15. Ethereum attack is more expensive than Bitcoin attack (as with Cardano.',\n",
       " ' which is the minimum attack cost). It is important to note that the cost of an increasing attack decreases with the current mood of the market. The highest network security at the beginning of the market price up and lowest at the end of the market price. Security changes often. In the case of Cardano and Bitcoin. the reduction of the amount of money in the reserve plays an important role. Both networks will only depend on the amount of the collected fee and the market price of the tokens will be. The future is difficult to predict. but if the number of users and the market price of tokens does not increase. security may collapse. Bitcoin may face this problem earlier than Cardano. because 19. 4 million BTC (92. 6%) is currently being exploited. If after half reduced. the market price of BTC will be the same as it is now. then the daily budget will be only half. ie 15 million USD. To keep the security as preserved as at present. the value of BTC must not be reduced to less than 60 thousand USD. only 77. 8% of the ADA is circulated so far. and we may have a little more time. Cardano has the advantage of even if the market price of the ADA tokens does not increase. the same amount can still be stake. so security can be similar even for 10 or 20 years. The article mainly focuses on the cost of the table. The tactics of the attacker. the behavior of the attacker and the market conditions will play an important role in a potential attack. We havent seen many successful attacks on Blockchain. small POW networks were often attacked. but they still exist and still with us. No one has successfully attacked the POS network. and we all know how difficult to get the amount of money needed for an attack on the POS network. Cardano has a reasonable distribution of tokens. and there are a large number of them being circulated. the attacker must buy money from the current Stake people. It is important to note that if the current Stake people do not sell ADA. the attacker will not have the opportunity to buy them. While the POW network is mainly protected by the cost of buying high hardware. it is only a type of item that can be produced and sold unlimited like electricity. Cardano is protected by a kind of mental intentions in the head of the Stake people. The more the distribution of tokens grows and the more stake people are enthusiastic. the harder the attacker to buy Ada money from these people. It can be said that Cardano is also protected by greed to some extent. everyone has their own limits when they are willing to sell. but in some cases. its price can be very high. The original property feature is a creative way to separate the token release from the token owner and transfer it as a core activity for the protocol.',\n",
       " ' Handling the principal assets is cheaper and safer. but with lower programming costs. lets compare the token approach of the cardano and Ethereum platform. The accounting infrastructure is determined in the expanded ledger model to be able to manage the tokens in the same way as the principal management ADA. The cardano ledger supports the transfer of transfer and ownership of different types of assets on its ledger (not through smart contracts like Ethereum). Cardano can cast. store and transfer tokens in a way called indigenous tokens (original). it does not need smart contracts like Ethereum to manage tokens. Original instructions are only used to create (and write) tokens. Transferring the original token from one address to another means that this function is provided in the protocol layer of the Cardano network. The same part of the protocol source code used to transfer the ADA money is also used to transfer the tokens. All the functions needed to handle tokens are only implemented once and are completely the same for all tokens. ledger and protocol that can handle tokens without a third party (token publisher) provides source code (smart contract) with additional rules and functions for basic activities. Users who want to cast tokens must determine the casting policy. This user is called property control. Money casting policy is a set of determination rules. AI and under the conditions will have the right to control the supply of tokens. for casting and burning. This user is called the token release. Property controller and token publisher may be an entity. Node always checks the compliance with money casting policies when the transaction is processed. There is almost no room for any exploitation exceeding the level. you can see who has the right to control the token in their life cycle. Casting and burning tokens is controlled by the token publisher. He needs to interact with Node Cardano. After the publisher sends tokens to the user address. the user will be the only one to control the token through their own wallet. the transfer and ownership of token does not depend on the original command (of the creator of it). The Cardano ledger is responsible for storing tokens and the protocol is responsible for moving them. The owner of the token uses the normal cardano wallet to build and send transactions to the network to spend token. Users can use tokens in third -party applications. Note that the instructions to cast and burn tokens are separate from the applications. Applications (made in Plutus platform) interact with Cardano to manipulate tokens. In blue boxes are the processes provided by Cardano and their functions cannot be determined or limited by the token publisher. In red boxes are processes determined by the token publisher. In yellow boxes is the enforcement environment (platform) that allows the processing of the users (program). When users own tokens. the publisher has absolutely no control over them. Users can send tokens to each other and just need the cardano protocol and ledger.',\n",
       " ' The token publisher can only gain control of tokens (and can burn them) if the user sends them to their address. Users can completely use any smart contract without being restricted or no need to apply for a token publisher. Here is a similar image for Ethereum so you can compare both platforms. One of the biggest advantages of indigenous assets is that they can be sent through ordinary transactions like the ADA. money transfer fee will be lower. as the demand for computer resources for their transfer is lower than having to use smart contracts. If you need to use a smart contract. the fee will depend on the complexity of the smart contract (in terms of the amount of resources that the smart contract needs to consume). Independence with smart contracts makes it easy to send more tokens in a transaction. It is even possible to identify many people in a transaction. The verification of such a transaction is very simple and as mentioned. the same for all tokens. Store tokens in the ledger and move them through the safer cardano protocol because it does not depend on the function deployed by a third party in the smart contract. the token cannot be lost due to the error in the contract code. It is not necessary to copy/paste some other available contracts or invent something new when you want to create tokens. It is impossible to customize the rules of token to have a disadvantage if the publisher wants to identify them for some reason. If the token publisher wants to keep the control of the token transfer due to the need to comply with the regulations. this is not possible in Cardanos case. the release of Stablecoin in a certain jurisdiction may require the ability to deploy a blacklist. censors transaction or freeze accounts. Note that the original tokens have the same (or very similar) properties with the ADA tokens. It is impossible to prevent someone from using tokens. performing a transaction censorship or freezing address with token. It is easy to check the token because they are stored transparently in the ledger. Just look up money casting policies and auditors have all the necessary information. When casting token on Cardano. it is only possible to identify the basic properties of tokens such as name. quantity and entity that can cast and burn tokens. Functions can only be determined for casting and burning. it is possible to specify the time later the extra casting or burning token is blocked. When casting tokens on Ethereum. it is necessary to write the entire smart contract in which the functions are determined. the specific behavior of each activity with the token. In addition to the name and number of tokens. it is necessary to determine the casting function. burning. transferring tokens and other things. the approval function can ensure the account is capable of spending a certain number of tokens on behalf of the sender. allowing a function that allows query tokens that an account is allowed to spend instead of another account.',\n",
       " ' Ethereum allows tokens to have higher programming. The token publisher has more control not only for casting and burning tokens but also can determine who can spend tokens and under any conditions. The image below describes the function controlled by the protocol and smart contracts. In red boxes. all processes must be determined by the token publisher. The contract defines the functions and events that dominate the creation. transfer and balance of the token. The smart contract also maintains the token balance of each account in its archive. The Ethereum protocol only provides enforcement environment (platform) to implement and perform smart contracts. The Ethereum protocol does not have any supervision or control over cast tokens. It only executes a smart contract code according to its rules and records its status changes on the ledger. Cardano protocols know about cast tokens and control their money through transactions and storage in ledger. The different approach of both platforms reflected in the third party application can use tokens. Applications in the Cardano ecosystem can arbitrarily operate with all existing tokens through original transactions. DEX construction groups have full control of all functions. They can identify the conditions to use tokens. Token publishers have no control over the use of tokens in third -party applications. the groups determine the function that allows them to receive tokens from the user (usually in exchange for other tokens). they determine the function of the liquidity group and swap tokens. Each dex can operate significantly. many smart contracts must interact with each other. DEX construction group must create a smart contract interacting with smart contracts used to cast tokens. If you want to swap tokens on Uniswap. 4 smart contracts will interact with each other. Smart contract for Token X. contract for token Y. Smart contract for liquidity group with Token X and Y and the so -called routing contract. facilitating the interaction between users and the briefcase. The groups of construction groups are somewhat limited by the operations determined in smart contracts to cast tokens. the standard interface is used so the interaction is relatively easy. The token in the Cardano blockchain is the same UTXO like the ADA. Can handle parallel transactions and verifying instructions. Note that sending tokens is completely independent of the Plutus platform. Plutus platform can be used to determine more advanced behavior. The token in Ethereum is a balance stored and adjusted by smart contracts. Parallel processing is impossible because each node in the network can only perform a transaction at a time. This is because Ethereum uses a sequential enforcement model and token processing (including token transfer) depends on the implementation environment (EVM). Casting token on Cardano is very simple and relatively safe. because the publisher only identifies the basic characteristics of tokens and the right to cast and burning. Basic activities with tokens are provided by Node Cardano. more complex activities can be programmed in the Plutus. This makes sending tokens very cheap because it consumes a minimum amount of computer resources.',\n",
       " ' Ethereum requires a defined token publisher (program) that all important functions for activities with tokens. including transfer. The better control of the token token token token is useful in some cases but the cost is higher in the consumption of computer resources. The difference in both approaches is probably the most noticeable in the ability to release Stablecoin to comply with the requirements prescribed by the management agency. people can limit token spending (transaction censorship. freezing accounts). while Cardano absolutely does not allow this. the higher programming ability of Ethereum can also be used for other positive functions. not only to limit the rights of users related to token spending. Cardano lacks functions similar to the ERC-20 standard that allows the token publisher to have more control over tokens. in terms of technology. Stablecoin cannot comply with the regulations of the management agencies on Cardano. it is probably better if the regulatory agencies allow the existence of Stablecoin that only the owner has control.August 10. For those who are new to participating. we explain what is peer -to -peer online communication and how to transfer money directly from one person to another with the users interaction through Blockchain. If Alice met Bob and gave him a $ 10 sheet. it was a peer -to -peer interaction (P2P). Both participants saw each other face to face. it is the simplest form of interaction with each other. The $ 10 sheet is a physical object and therefore. physical contact is necessary to transfer value. Alice had to take the bill from his wallet and give it to Bob. and Bob will put the bill into his wallet. money also has a digital form. Alice and Bob can set up a bank account that is basically a digital wallet. Alice can send BOB $ 10 from her digital wallet to Bobs digital wallet through bank transfer. This form of communication can be done at a distance. Alice and Bob can be thousands of kilometers apart. Note that a bank (or many banks) plays an intermediary between Alice and Bob. Banks provide services to their customers and have full rights to the money that customers have sent to them. They can collect transaction data. abuse customer data or even block transactions and freeze accounts. Interaction via bank is considered concentration. An intermediary participated in the interaction between Alice and BOB. who is capable of preventing or complicating the value transfer process. which can exist tokens and tokens of a certain value. Dollar can be encrypted. This form of money is called stablecoin. Alice and Bob can use Blockchain and transfer value in the way P2P. They do not need a third party or an intermediary to interact with each other. Alice and Bob can use Blockchain to create and verify transactions recorded in a decentralized ledger. shared and maintained by a network of nodes. Each node in the network can play a role as both a sender and a trader. and a authentic person and spread the blocks.',\n",
       " ' Alice used Blockchain wallet and created a transaction that she then sent to the Blockchain network. all nodes in the network. verify the transaction and if it is valid. it will be permanently stored in a decentralized ledger through a new block. A value has been transferred to the transaction. If Bob looked at his own Blockchain wallet. he would see that he had received the value (token) from Alice. Blockchain network can be considered a similar service or tool provided by banks because it allows the transfer of value between Alice and BOB. especially the nodes of the block manufacturer. are not considered intermediaries in the P2P communication between Alice and Bob because they do not have the full control of transactions and cannot change. cancel or reverse the transaction in any way. All valid transactions are always included in the block. The nodes of the block manufacturer are only responsible for authenticating and spreading transactions and blocks into the network. following the consensus rules that all nodes agree. The nodes of the block manufacturer are not intermediaries. but the support of the P2P network. Blockchain networks are decentralized and secure as long as there are sufficient diversity. participation and innovation in the ecosystem. The more nodes produce independent blocks in the network. the more centralized and safer the network. When the diversity and the decline. the quality of the main features of the network also decreases. We will talk about the following. Blockchain simplifies interaction between Alice and Bob compared to traditional financial systems. Blockchain allows the form of digital network interaction between participants. Note that banks cannot operate in peer -to -peer revolution because there is always a focus between participants. often more of them. Alice and Bob can only communicate P2P if both run their own full nodes. they will have to run Daedalus wallet. installed on the users computer with Node Cardano. most users do not run their own full node. because it is not user friendly and requires computer resources (mainly memory). If the user starts a wallet (with full node) before they want to use it. it must be synchronized with the blockchain. Node download and verify all newly added blocks including transactions. This may take some time. Due to more comfort. users prefer to use the so -called lightweight. These wallets are usually only the extended utility of the browser connected to the server operated by a third party. These servers are connected to the Blockchain network. Lightweight wallet is not connected directly to the Blockchain network. so they do not have a copy of their own ledger. That is why they are called lightweight wallets. If you use the Trezor and Ledger hardware wallet in the usual way (without your own full node). then you also connect to the servers operated by the supplier. Alice and Bob no longer communicated the way P2P directly because they had to believe in the third party server. They sacrificed P2P communication to bring more comfort to users and must trust the third party to connect to the Blockchain network.',\n",
       " ' third parties are a weakness of decentralization because if they turn off the server. the user will lose connection with the Blockchain network. their digital property is still safe as long as users hold their own locks used to sign transactions. They can connect to the blockchain network in a different way (through another wallet) and integrate with other users. Can communication by P2P and at the same time are not forced to operate a complete node? Can a lightweight wallet with node security? Yes. Mithril technology will allow creating reliable lightweight wallets with adequate node security. When lightweight Mithril can be deployed. Alice and Bob will not have to depend on the third party server. They will have the ability to communicate P2P from user -friendly wallets that can run on mobile phones. Note that the image with the Daedalus wallet looks very similar to the image with the Mithril wallet. The level of decentralization. especially the number of blocks producing blocks. directly affects the quality of P2P communication between users. In addition to other attributes. users want to be included (no need to ask for permission to use the network). censorship resistance and fairness (all users are equal) from a decentralized network. These features achieved mainly through the high participation of block manufacturers and their diversity. This makes all block manufacturers unable to know each other. They come from different geographical locations and have different incentives. the biggest offer is the reward from the network. If one or several block manufacturers deviate from the expected performance of their functions. then the user thinks that it will only have a minimum impact on the overall operation of the network. If the majority of manufacturers perform their activities in accordance with the users expectations. the network will succeed and be used. The biggest threat to blockchain networks is decline in decline. If the number of mass manufacturers is low or if some of them dominate significantly. the quality of the features that users expect can decrease. if a block manufacturer dominates with 30% of the shares starting to censor the transaction of some users. then they will be more damaged than others. as their transactions can be handled later. Another smaller manufacturer can be included in the transactions that the manufacturer dominates the censorship. but the fairness will be violated. there should be many manufacturers in the network that even if you send a transaction every minute in 1 hour. that transaction will be put into the bloc by another (almost) manufacturer at a time. If this case happens. that means no entity has the right to dominate the network. Despite the multi -pool operators in Cardano network. Cardano meets the requirements of high decentralization. ie 180 blocks per hour.100 pool operating to create blocks. Cardano will have the opportunity to pass our decentralized test. this is just a hurried invention to measure decentralization. I hope you understand this point. A decentralization will be better if you send a transaction every minute for 24 hours and each other producer put that transaction into the block.',\n",
       " ' Cardano will not pass this test because such requirements are too ambitious for current blockchain networks. It requires a minimum of 1.440 independent block manufacturers online (and of course a little luck). See which entity has created the last 20 consecutive blocks in the 3 largest decentralized networks in the Top 10 (Bitcoin has an average time of 10 minutes and Ethereum is 12 seconds). Innovation is another necessary part of blockchain projects. as they allows to maintain a high decentralization. All networks will naturally tend to focus over time. Pools. along with the community. will have a lot of work to do to keep the network of decentralized and economic sustainable in the long term. Sometimes it is said that decentralized is like democracy. It is necessary to take care of it. or we can lose it. Blockchain network can reduce the number of participants between Alice and Bob to a minimum. especially if they use their own full node. only the Blockchain network (block manufacturer) and no third party participate. The current infrastructure of most networks depends on third -party servers. because many people want to use lightweight wallets or centralized services (exchange). Mithril technology can also ensure P2P communication and high quality comfort for users. We will have to wait a while for Mithril to be used in a lightweight wallet on the mobile platform.August 9. Paypal plans to launch his own Stablecoin Pyusd on Ethereum. The question is why no stablecoin is supported in USD in Cardano ecosystem and the community can accept this in what conditions. Stablecoin is managed by organizations that are accompanied by contradictory properties with decentralized principles. Discover the difference in architecture of Cardano and Ethereum to understand the difference between tokens released through smart contracts and original tokens on Cardano. I believe Blockchain will break the vision of the Internet and Web3 will become a reality within a decade. Perhaps a bit paradoxical. the motivation of change will not be Crypto. but stablecoin. The application of Stablecoin can increase the application of crypto because many people hold the original property of the network they apply daily to financial activities will be more reasonable. if Paypal is releasing a stableCoin on Ethereum. they must hold a large amount of ETH. The incentives are economic and reasonable. The application increases the network effect and this increases the collected fee. along with the desire to hold property associated with success. USD has a large network effect similar to other Fiat currencies. Through coding dollars. many people will apply Blockchain wallet to become the web3 entrance gate. many people will only have coded dollars in their Blockchain wallet. but over time. other things like digital identities. NFT and other encrypted financial assets will become popular. Some users may remain loyal to depository solutions. but I believe that more and more people will start moving to self -deposition solutions. DEFI on Stablecoin and more integrated with traditional financial services can attract millions of new users into the Blockchain world.',\n",
       " ' Blockchain networks dominate will become the currency of the Internet. Many people will make the most of web3 and the number of users will increase. It is logic and nature. If self -storage is meaningful to you in case of holding ADA. And you understand the benefits that this form brings. you will have similar requirements for money and other financial assets. The crypto application starts with them. It continues through the ability to exchange digital values \\\\u200b\\\\u200baccording to the peer -to -peer revolution. The next step is social and social financial services. which we know under the abbreviation of DEFI and Web3. Stablecoin is an absolute necessity to accept crypto. as the high fluctuations of crypto hinder their application. The vast majority of Crypto holds on centralized exchanges and other monitoring services because they are not interested in applying them to pay and DEFI. A story about valuable archives has prevail among crypto fans. which naturally leads to reluctance to applying it as a means of exchange. The fact that the legal money is still a better means of exchange than Crypto. All ecosystems that want to succeed in the coming years must have Stablecoin. ideally as stablecoins supported in USD at this application stage. Paypal on the X platform (formerly Twitter) claims that Pyusd will be supported by high liquidity and safety assets. I understand that Pysusd may not be supported by 1: 1 by USD. but that may not be a problem at this time. It is important to know that stablecoins are released by managed organizations that come with their application terms and these are not compatible with decentralized principles. You may already know what I will tell you now. Paypal can freeze accounts and censor user transactions. If you see the source code of the smart contract for Stablecoin Pyusd. you will find things you dont like. Paypal can freeze your account or erase the balance of the address to freeze. If you look at the application terms publicly. you will be surprised at what Paypal can do. in this document. you can find out that Paypal can confiscate your crypto assets if they think youve done illegal activities. *If we believe that you have been involved in any limited activity. we can take some actions to protect Paypal. Paypal customers and others anytime according to our own decision. In addition to the remedial measures determined in the terms and conditions of your Paypal balance. the actions we can perform include but not limited to limiting access or application of your crypto center and/or temporarily stopping your crypto center immediately and not being sanctioned for us. including limiting your ability to buy. sell or transfer Crypto assets. You authorize Paypal to seize your crypto asset if we believe that a transaction involves that crypto assets related to money laundering. terrorist funding. fraud or any other criminals. it is necessary to ask whether the release of Pyusd is a positive event or rather negatively for the blockchain industry.',\n",
       " ' This is definitely a good news for the application. but the violation of decentralized principles may not satisfy anyone who believes that Blockchain can break the financial system and return the power to the user. Paypals Stablecoin left a large portion of power in the companys hands. Paypal has chosen the Ethereum platform because it is possible to achieve the function as required by the management agency. All the main stablecoins are supported in USD including USDT and USDC has been cast on Ethereum and some other platforms. It should be added that these stablecoins have attributes similar to Pyusd. they meet the specified requirements. There is an urgent question that the Cardano community faces. Do we want these stablecoins on the cardano platform even if they have to pay the price by censorship and the ability to freeze their accounts? And can the deployment be even done?. One of the main reasons that no Stablecoin is supported in USD on Cardano is the design difference compared to Ethereum. Ethereum allows tokens to be cast through smart contracts. similar smart contracts must be applied to any operations for tokens. including transactions to them to other addresses. Third -party developers can deploy any function into smart contracts. including the ability to freeze user accounts. blacklist addresses. you can see how smart contracts are applied in interactions between Alice and Bob. Alice wants to send token Pyusd to Bob. This requirement is processed by Solidity Smart Contract source code. Third -party developers have the right to control how smart contracts will handle user activities. they decided to see if the tokens were transferred from Alices address to Bobs address. Cardano applies the so -called multi -property ledger. Cardano allows casting (and burning) tokens through original instructions. The original instruction set only allows you to identify basic tokens rules through very simple operations. After the token is cast. the Cardano protocol can be transferred to the same as ADA. without application of a copier or smart contract. the same source code at the cardano protocol level is applied to transfer ADA to be applied to transfer tokens. The third parties have no control over the cardano protocol and cannot modify the same function as Ethereum allows through smart contracts. Cardano protocol does not allow freezing accounts or censorships in the case of ADA. so this also applies to all tokens in the Cardano ledger. the current function cannot be implemented for Stablecoin to meet the requirements of the regulatory agency. you can see a similar example when Alice wants to send tokens to Bob. Note that the original command is only applied to cast tokens. The transfer of tokens takes place through the source code of the cardano protocol. Can not censors. put on the black list and freeze the account. Cardano does not allow people to cast tokens to control them. The tokens cast on Ethereum can program more. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Moving tokens in Cardano network is cheaper.',\n",
       " ' safer and due to less direct programming. it does not allow things like trading and freezing accounts. It is important that the tokens are always owned by users and no one can take them or prevent them from being sent to others. Ethereum users have to pay more when using tokens. because they need to pay gas fees to use smart contracts. There may be errors in smart contracts. thanks to the higher programming ability. it can meet the requirements of the management agency. It is important to note that users do not own the token they have on their address. The tokens are actually owned by anyone who has a smart contract control to a certain extent. the application of depository service for ERC-20 or holding tokens in their wallets is almost not important. because this is not self-depository in the true sense of this word. When sending Pyusd. there will always be a smart contract between Alice and Bob for being controlled by a third party. Paypal. it is possible to create a smart contract that respects decentralized principles. users may not verify the behavior of the token they are using. The Cardano community is arguing about the introduction of the so-called smart or super property token. ie the tokens similar to the ERC-20 standard. These tokens will allow the programming ability to transfer from one account to another. you can see the proposal that HarmonicLabs offer. The question that the community should have the answer is whether we want such something. Compliance with the requirements prescribed as a topic will divide the community because the opinions may vary. We really need stablecoins supported in USD. businesses cannot apply Cardano to cast Stablecoin unless legal requirements are met. Should the Cardano community attach great importance to decentralized principles even when paying the price by applying the project slower or providing the function that allows the function of the government to request?. Emurgo has not been able to deploy USDA as planned due to legal barriers. the Mehen USD (USDM) project has appeared on Catalyst. this is another effort to provide a stablecoin type supported in USD. One of the other ways to receive stablecoin supported by USD on Cardano is through a bridge. The bridge is still a risk and the Cardano community will definitely remember the Nomad hacking that allows USDC and USDT to be applied in Cardano ecosystem in a short time. Cardano has a stablecoin based on the mortgage algorithm. DJED. more decentralized than the stablecoins supported in USD. the algorithm Stablecoin currently does not receive the trust of users due to the collapse of the UST project (Terra Luna). It is best to have stablecoins that are supported by USD as the original property in the Cardano ecosystem. with all the benefits of decentralization. I am not sure if this can be achieved and so far it seems not. we should think about whether or not to deploy a function that allows token to create whether the transfer process may be conditional (ie controlled by a third -party source code).',\n",
       " 'August 4. Cardanos POS is based on Nakamotos consensus. it is only possible to achieve the so -called probability of the block. sometimes the case of pools that produce blocks will be abandoned. We will talk about this case and revolution can be solved. A 5 -day Epoch Cardano and divided into parts called slots have a second length. there are 432.000 slots in an epoch. The randomity of the cardano protocol is configured to create a block every 20 seconds. it is possible to create about 21.600 blocks in each epoch. Each registered pool is a potential candidate that can cast a block in a specific slot. A node has the right to cast a block called slot leader. The selection of slot leaders (the position that is determined to close the block) must be random. Lottery running network does not depend on any central control. Individual nodes can automatically find out if they are winning lottery in a certain slot or not. check if they may be able to create a new block. The coding function is called a verification function (VRF) used to draw the slot path. VRF was introduced by Micali. Rabin and Vadhan in 1999 and was used in different diagrams. protocols and password systems. The basic concept of VRF is very simple. The owner of the secret lock can calculate the output value as well as the evidence related to any input value. Everyone. by using the evidence and the public lock (verification key). can check if the output value is actually calculated accurately or not. only one node creates essential certificates and stores it in the blockchain can cast blocks. Through the registration certificate. all the necessary information (including verification key) is stored in the blockchain. all nodes have all relevant information to verify the blocks (and evidence) created by other nodes. When a node receives a block from the network. it can verify that it is valid through VRF evidence and that it is created by a node that is actually the leader in that slot. The VRF algorithm receives multiple inputs to be able to evaluate whether a certain node becomes a slot clue in a specific slot. Besides other things. they include the current slot ID and ⅔ of all VRF outputs from Epoch first. from which a single hash function (value) is created. This hash function is also known as Nonce. Nonce makes it impossible to calculate the results of VRF before too far. This is an easy task because it originates from the scale of the shares. The shares include the operators ada money (pledge) and all the stake people. The greater the stake. the more the pool can produce the block in a certain epoch. every pool uses the VRF algorithm to get the VRF output. the pool has become a slot leader and has the right to cast a new block. Node 7 has become Slot Leader. The VRF output is 28. 454. 834 and the threshold is 30.',\n",
       " ' Node will have the right to cast a new block and insert evidence VRF (VRF output) into the Block title. The VRF evidence in the proposed block is used for authentication. Any other node in the network uses VRF algorithm to verify that the block is valid. In addition to VRF evidence. the Block must be signed by KES key (the key signature code of the key). This is the next level of security so that if the attacker can somehow break the VRFs activity. they still do not have the operators KES to sign the blocks. A slot battle occurs when two pools gain the right to cast a block in the same slot. there will be two slots Leader in a slot. it is likely that the two blocks are competitive. Only one block can be inserted into the blockchain on certain slots. so one of them must be removed. It is said that later called Block was removed as an orphan block (Orphan Block). Node 7 has become a slot leader because the VRF output is 28. 834. lower than the threshold of 30. In the same slot. Node 3 also becomes a slot leader with VRF output of 16.459.996. lower than the threshold of 27.500. Both nodes cast a new block. insert VRF output (evidence VRF) into that block and distribute it to other nodes in Cardano network. An orphaned block must not receive pool rewards. This means that only a single pool can receive a reward for a block created in the same slot. If the rapid blocking of blocks (low latency). there is many other nodes in the network will receive both blocks. Block is cast by Node 7 with VRF 28. 834 output and block casted by Node 3 with VRF output 16. 459. 996. If a node gets two valid blocks for a slot. it will choose a lower VRF output block. A node removes a block with higher VRF evidence. basically making it an orphan. Pools with lower stake are more advantageous in the Slot Battle war because it is more likely to create a lower VRF output. You may already know that in our example. the red block blocked by Node 3 has won the green block from Node 7. If a Slot Battle battle occurs. the winner is randomly determined. Pool operators do not have the opportunity to influence the selection of blocks that occur on other nodes in the network as long as they act honestly. From the blockchain perspective. the situation looks like this. There is a slot battle in slot n+40. A node received two blocks cast in the same slot. It chose the red block as the last block in the blockchain and removed the green block. Another block is cast in Slot N+60 and Slot Leader has followed the red block. With each additional Block. it is clear that the chain behind the red block will exist in the Blockchain forever while the green block will remain intact.',\n",
       " ' As we mentioned at the beginning. about 21.600 blocks can be cast in an epoch. The best results in some recent epochs are 21.417 blocks molded in Epoch 411. in Epochs. there are about 20.900 to 21. 11 blocks are cast. A node can become a slot leader and for some reason. it may not be able to cast a block (for example. because it is not online at the time it becomes slot leader). Slot Battles takes place relatively often. there are about 420 battles in each epoch. ie about 4 matches per hour. It is about 2% of the total block. you should wait for a few blocks before seeing your blocking block is the last block. If there are about 4 slot battle every hour. I dare to assert that waiting for 6 blocks (2 minutes) is long enough to make sure that the block is the last. A block can become orphaned for another reason. If it does not reach the node to become a slot leader fast enough. then the slot leader is forced to follow the block before (the last block is available). Many observed that the reward from Stake Ada is decreasing. Anyone who understands Cardanos monetary policy is not surprised. the reward is smaller than what is expected about three years ago. Lets take a look at why so and some charts will clarify everything for you. The monetary policy of Cardano project has been determined from the beginning of the project in the Genesis block. During the public sale took place in Japan. 6% of the ADA amount was sold. 5% and EMURGO 4. It is important that 30. 9% is still stored to set rewards and develop more projects. Stake rewards are based on two pillars. The first pillar is reserves. from which 0. 3% is taken each Epoch and the second pillar is the collected fee. We have described the monetary policy of Cardano project in one of our previous posts. a single photo is all you need to understand the basic mechanism. Note that 20% of the virtual money (maximum ada money for the prize of the era) is transferred to the budget. note that a part of the ADA amount is returned to the reserve fund (no recipient). The reward is decreasing for three reasons. the reserve will decrease after each epoch. so 0. 3% is taken from the smaller number of ADA. the conditions to achieve the maximum reward may not be met. so a significant part of the ADA is returned to the reserve fund. The third reason is that the fee collected in an epoch is not large enough to compensate for the increasing number of coins. there were 8.969.722.014 dong ADA reserved and 1.336.737.021 dong ada in the project warehouse. In Epoch 427. 9k coin ADA was collected. Note that the fee collected tends to increase over time. You can check your own reserve is decreasing and the fund grows in Cexplorer. 3% of 9B is 27m.',\n",
       " ' 27 million is roughly the amount taken from the budget as the maximum possible reward. As explained. a part of the ADA will be used as a reward and a part will be returned to the reserve fund. For each next Epoch. a smaller ADA amount will be taken from the reserve in the form of maximum potential rewards. The ADA coin paid by the reward will gradually increase the number of circulating tokens. When only 8B in reserves. 3% will be only 24 million coins ADA. And so. only about half of the maximum reward can be paid. ie about half returned to the reserve fund. Note that the fee collected does not even correspond to 1% of the amount taken from the reserve. more than 99% of Stake rewards are taken from the reserve. The current fee collected is basically negligible. only half of the rewards are paid. so this ratio is a bit better than the fee that the network collects each epoch. The fee may be about 1-2% of the total number of rewards. If the Stake reward will be sustainable for a long time at the same level as it is now. it is required to collect an increasing amount of ADA to use the network. Reduced reserves must be offset by using the network. If the average fee is maintained at 0. 16 ADA and the network will collect 10 million per Epoch (5 days). about 60 million people have to use the network each Epoch. This figure is about 250 times higher than the current average. About 50.000 people use Cardano every day (sometimes more. sometimes less). Stake rewards will be significantly higher if the conditions for maximum rewards can be met. this is not the case. Markus. a member of Cardano Foundation. presented a chart with a maximum possible reward and a chart that reflects the reality (and the future developments) in a tweet. In the following picture. you can see how the reserve will decrease if the maximum reward can. is paid for each epoch. reserves were expected to only 7B. The fact is roughly 9B. so another 2b. In the chart below. the red line represents the maximum possible reward (as in the chart above). Green roads represent reality. The purple line on the bottom left is the Cardano budget. Cardano protocols are designed to encourage decentralized development and let operators provide quality services for the network. The deviation compared to the expectation of the protocol reduces the Stake reward. The maximum reward can be paid by the protocol if there is a complete saturated pool (100%). The parameter K is the number of pool required. placed in 500 at the time of writing. all the pools will have to cast 100% of the block and have an ideal commitment. Slot battles (slot battles). too saturated pool. ada money are authorized for the pool to stop operating. low commitment amounts. missing slots (non -casting pools for many reasons). many existing pools are more than the requirements of K parameters.',\n",
       " ' many unsaturated pools do not cast any block in each Pool Wocher. all this reduces the STKE reward. even if Cardano is highly decentralized and in fact. there are more casting pools than the requirements of the K parameter. the conditions for the maximum reward may not be met. it is almost impossible to achieve the ideal state. so it is impossible to expect maximum rewards that can be paid at all times. I personally think that Stake reward will be a bit higher than the present. The deviation from the ideal state is relatively high. The fact that the maximum reward may not be paid and have more than 2 billion ADA in the reserve compared to expected is a positive point. Cardano has more time to develop applications. There is a relatively large amount of ADA in the project warehouse for Catalyst. managing and further developing the ecosystem. The application of blockchain technology is slower than expected and the use of blockchain networks as well as DEFI is significantly reduced in the price market. There are two paths that lead to higher rewards. Stake people should think more about the pool they decided to entrust money Ada for. If they want to meet the requirements of the protocol. there must be 500 saturated pools that fully require commitment and cast all blocks when they become the slot allocator. When deciding whether or not to increase the parameter K or not. many people should think of the current state. Does the stake reward increased if the parameter K increased to 750 or 1000?. The long -term goal is clear. It is essential that as many people as possible use cardano and pay. Long -term economic sustainability is directly linked to utilities. This is not only for Cardano but basically for all public blockchain networks with a fixed amount of money. Cardano has no inflation (tail inflation). so once the reserve decreases (or significantly reduced). it will completely depend on the collected fee. Increasing the first class (Input Endorsers) is a prerequisite for success. it is necessary to think about the introduction of a fee market (price by level). The most difficult task is to attract users to really come to Cardano. something that many other ecosystems are trying to do.August 1. Cardano is the first layer (L1) and the Blockchain network that does not currently expand well. Hydra is the second layer (L2) with a very good rate. it is not clear black and white. Although the L2 solves the problem of low expansion of blockchain. they bring many questions that we do not know the answer. Should we focus on the ability to expand the blockchain better or to focus L2 development?. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the first and second -generation blockchain networks and are unable to expand their scale. as the representative of the third generation of Blockchain. is in the same situation. Although the IOG group plans to solve this problem and Ouroboros Leios POS (with Input Endosers) will bring a significant improvement.',\n",
       " ' even Cardano is currently not able to apply globally. No blockchain has the ability to expand well in the top 10 and still have to maintain a high level of decentralization. As soon as it is clear that the L1 cannot handle new user transactions effectively. it is necessary to quickly offer some simple solutions. People began to complain that transactions were too expensive. slow and unreliable compared to banking services. Increasing the expansion capacity of L1 is a complex and obvious technology problem that can take many years. The reasons why the Blockchain networks do not expand the good scale and are well known and there is no use of discussing them in this article. The problem begins to be solved through different seconds and the community believes it is a good solution. Although L2 solves one of the basic problems of L2. it leads to many other issues that we should add. It can be said that people have begun to use L2. so the problem has at least resolved partially. or assuming it is postponed. with the application of L2. problems become more clear. Start by viewing a list of problems. we will split them more details. The L2 adds complexity to the use of Blockchain inherently challenging from the perspective of ordinary users. The fact is that most users hold crypto on concentrated exchanges because they are afraid to use Blockchain wallets. People consider registering a centralized trading floor as a safe and familiar process. the direct use of Blockchain is a challenge for many people. Only handling the password/seed cluster safely is a fairly large challenge and an activity that people want to avoid. L2 is usually networks with different addresses and different rules. Users are forced to understand not only the basic function of Blockchain but also the way the operation of a specific L2 network. Users must learn how to transfer assets from one network to another and vice versa. as well as the risks. The room for errors and loss of money is relatively large. The more L2 exists. the more user and the more fragmented. There are many L1 and all large projects have at least one L2 solution dominated. Ethereum has a lot of large L2. The fragmentation is a problem not only in an ecosystem but also in the entire blockchain industry. If Alice uses Lightning Network. Bob uses Polygon and Carol to use Hydra. then these users will not have the opportunity to interact with each other. Everyone is in another ecosystem and on another L2 network. Users are separated including their capital. This is also a problem from the viewpoint of traders who want to accept crypto as one of the payment options. They will support all existing L1 and L2. which is almost impossible. users must agree on a unified solution. which also seems unrealistic. If the seller only accepts the Bitcoin ecosystem. then they will lose users who prioritize the Cardano or Ethereum ecosystem. The companies that want to cast NFT will encounter the same problem.',\n",
       " ' They have to decide what the money casting will take place on the specific basis and therefore basically only target a part of Crypto users. If the casting process takes place on Cardano. users are loyal to the Ethereum ecosystem cannot interact with these NFT. The largest stablecoins USDT and USDC exist in some L1. The encrypted USD can be replaced. so this is not the big problem as for NFT irreplaceable. If a stockization company. what strategies they should choose? Choose a L1 or some?. It is difficult to decide based on the number of users. because it is likely that it will change over time. One of the reasons why the application of blockchain technology of companies and businesses is slow may be due to fragmentation of users in some competitive ecosystems. Note that we are talking about fragmentation at L1. More fragmentation at L2 level only makes things more complicated. There may be many L2 competition in an ecosystem. Companies and businesses want to target the largest number of user possible and naive when expected that their services will succeed if it only targets the user of a specific network. it is innocent to expect people to accept a series of specific networks for a specific service. It indicates that strong communities created around individual projects have existed for a long time and cannot ignore this phenomenon. L2 takes over the users activities and the cost they pay for the services. This is another relatively large issue that threatens the economic sustainability of L1. there are more and more discussions about the privacy budget. all L1 sooner or later will face this problem. Cardano and Ethereum have the advantage of being more effective POS consensus. so less funding requirements. all blockchain networks must reward those who participate in security and decentralized networks or provide computer resources to the network. If the user switches permanently to L2 without having to return to L1. then L1 will basically lose most of the fee. People will pay smaller for user -friendly services on L2. L2 usually only inherits a part of security from L1. L2 is often more focused and less safer (administrative courses). The important thing to keep is the L1 for decentralization. But who will pay for decentralization if the user mainly uses L2?. L2 users are forced to pay on-chain transactions when transferring assets from L1 to L2 and vice versa. if this no longer happens. it will become an annoying problem for L1. L2 depends on L1 to ensure their existence. but basically L2 is the par parasitard on L1. L2 cannot completely solve the low expansion capacity of L1. Groups may delay the resolution of L1 expansion because they believe that it is enough to focus on L2 development. Sometimes I come across an opinion that the L1 does not need to expand the scale if there is at least one L2 dominated in the ecosystem. I disagree with this idea. If L1 does not expand well.',\n",
       " ' it will also directly affect the quality of L2. Everyone must be introduced to L2 and if it is expensive and slow. it will hinder the application. Even more if L2 users are forced to interact with L1 and pay. a successful ecosystem is ready to apply a mass to address the ability to expand on L1 and have at least one L2. This solves most of the issues mentioned. I think L2 is an option for advanced users. Many users will want to rely on L1. the L1 must be affordable in terms of economic and reliable enough for the number of users is much larger than their current capabilities. but if there are many L2 in each ecosystem. the maximum number of users and capital will still be in L1. a specific L2 may become dominant and replace competitive solutions (including L1). People will only use L1 if the fee is low and pay quickly. From the perspective of the privacy budget. the essential thing is that L1 provides the same utility as L2. I am not afraid to say that L1 will compete directly with L2 about users. which is mainly about their fees. If the fee on the L2 is lower than a few steps. the L1 will only be able to compete with them in a difficult way. People will simply be forced to learn how to use L2 (and leave L1 permanently). it is possible to link blockchain together and allow the transfer of assets. It is possible to encrypt BTC and transfer it from Bitcoin blockchain to other blockchain. This type of blockchain connection will be quite popular in the next few years. Individual blockchains must expand well if they are user friendly. I find great potential in multi -chain wallets like Lace. Users will have a single wallet and it will allow them to interact with multiple blockchains (and finally L2) safely and easily. I can imagine that users will have NFT cast in different L1 in a single wallet. They may have ADA. ETH and USDT next to each other and if they want to perform swap between these assets. only a few clicks directly on the wallet. Everything takes place in background mode and users may not even notice if it is on L1 or L2. The only thing they pay attention to is the cost and operating speed. There are some comments that have a good debate about building L2 or focusing more on the ability to expand Blockchain. I personally think that both are important and all blockchains. should expand the scale better if they want economic sustainability in the long term. Some experts even believe that L2 may be a dead end in the development process and if there is a blockchain that can be expanded and at the same time. it will gradually become a dominant network. I dont think this can achieve this in the next 10 years. but it can be done without L2 completely will be the best solution possible from many different views.',\n",
       " ' the L2 is still here because the level of decentralization and security provided by L1 is not always necessary.July 28. a map and signature protocol based on shares. is preparing to release the main network. promising to revolutionize the Cardano ecosystem. It is aimed at improving the node synchronization time. enhancing security and giving decentralized management rights. Imagine Mithril is an effective and safe highway for information on Blockchain Cardano. It acts as a powerful means to increase the speed and effectiveness of how the nodes synchronize and communicate with each other. In Cardanos world. there are thousands of dispersed nodes. like individual cars on the crowded road network. Each node needs to be synchronized with the rest to share data about new blocks and transactions. similar to how cars need interaction to avoid collisions and keep the traffic smooth. this is where Mithril appears: its like a turbocharger for these nodes. making their synchronization process fast as lightning while ensuring top security settings. With the power of Mithril. Cardano network becomes more reasonable. more efficient and able to support many applications and cases of use. Mithril ensures that all nodes on the Cardano highway communicate seamlessly and safely. making the whole network become more reliable and stronger. The architecture of Mithril consists of three main components: general set. signers and workstations. These nodes operate in parallel to improve the efficiency of starting a Node Cardano. Mithrils protocol design takes advantage of shares to achieve higher efficiency. ensuring transparency without increasing the requirements of reliability and creating a balance between size and efficiency through module design. It allows for many quick and effective signatures without affecting security. making it an ideal solution for an expandable blockchain like Cardano. Mithrils applications are very large. from enhancing the effectiveness of adequate node applications such as Daedalus to supporting lightweight guest applications and mobile applications with unreliable approaches. Sidechains can benefit from verifying the light blockchain status of Mithril and its -based voting applications that can use Mithril signatures to verify slightly and safely. Mithrils journey began by releasing evidence of conceptuality in August 2022. then more deep understanding of its potential and roadmap in December of the same year. The group is currently in the final test stage. preparing for the main network release this summer. The full release of Mithril is ready to upgrade the LACE wallet. developed by IOHK. promoting its full potential as a lightweight wallet with adequate node security on Cardano. Lace wallet. designed to facilitate users as a lightweight guest application. faces a strong security challenge without downloading the entire blockchain. Mithrils stake -based signature signature was born to rescue. allowing quick and safe booting Cardano blockchaino state. With Mithril. Lace wallet can access important blockchain data quickly and safely. bringing a seamless user experience without affecting safety. Mithrils upcoming main network release was set to revolution Cardano with improved node synchronization. advanced security and decentralized management. The protocol will create a reasonable and effective communication network between nodes.',\n",
       " ' paving the way for a new decentralized renovation era. Cardanos future is effective. strong and empowered through Mithrils ability to change. You can read Mithrils white books here.July 21. Currently in the final test stage. Mithril is preparing to launch on the main internet (Mainnet). But what is Mithril? How will Mithril help and how to join Mithril?. Mithril is a stake-based signature scheme and a protocol that helps improve the speed and effectiveness of the synchronization time to keep the blockchain material of the nodes. Mithril will help increase the node synchronization time faster. provide security and empower the decision making more decentralized. more reasonable and capable of supporting more applications and expanding its usability. The evidence of Mithrils concept was released in August 2022. the group officially introduced Mithril. revealing more about its benefits. applications and routes. Mithril is currently in the final test stage before releasing the main network this summer. This article will summarize the functions of the Mithril protocol. explain the architecture of Mithril and offer ways to participate. Joining the prosperous Cardano ecosystem means promoting its healthy development. Cardano network is combined by thousands of decentralized nodes into a unified system. allowing seamless communications to share data on new blocks and transactions. There are two ways for you to participate in Cardano network:. The synchronization process of each adequate node always requires longer and as well as mandatory conditions for specific software and hardware storage. light applications are based on a third -party API service (but this will reduce decline and be forced to believe in another third party). What will happen if we can get the best of both?. both providing data information quickly but still having to ensure decentralization. That is Mithrill. Take advantage of Mithril to start a full and effective node Cardano. which is the first case that comes with the original beta release on the main network. Mithril accessed SnapShot the current blockchain state to help increase the synchronization time for nodes and support strong security installation. See this presentation from Io Scotfest to learn more about how Mithril provides light. effective and safe booting process. With the development of Mithril. DAPT developers will be able to deploy light -lighter passenger applications and applications or rationalize Sidechain activities. Mithril will also empower its own -based voting applications and management solutions. regardless of the complexity of the protocol. Verification of tally and safety through the Mithril signature can simplify decentralized decisions. bringing verified results. The Mithril Research article: Multi -signature -based shares has been published by IOG researchers by 2021 and this blog post discussed how the protocol acts as a threshold signature diagram that allows to take advantage of transparent. safe and lightweight shares. After releasing evidence of Mithrils concept by 2022. the network was supported and tested by a group of volunteer spos (SPO). This test stage allows the Pool to distribute the signed nodes. summarized and applied guests in distributions released every two weeks. The group has also deployed a multi -signature diagram based on shares and set up the SPO full Snapshot node certification process.',\n",
       " ' The Mithril network is currently being tested in a preview test environment and Pre-Product. which will soon be available in the form of beta on the main network. Mithril has a high -level route including the following releases:. The Mithril architecture consists of three main components: general set. they form a network of nodes to improve the effectiveness of starting a Node Cardano. Figure 1. Mithril network architecture. Mithril Signer is a transparent node on a node or Node Cardano of SPO. It works with the Mithril synthesis and performs the following tasks:. Mithril Aggregator is a reliable node responsible for coordinating the activities of the Node signed Mithril. It works with Node Cardano and performs some important functions:. Mithril Client is a node currently used to restore a complete node of Cardano. Station/Application (Client) interact with the Mithril general set to retrieve essential components to restore the node:. In future repetitions. workstations will also be used to verify any certificates created by the protocol for the corresponding data. Please note that the Mithril network architecture is in the process of finishing and can change. The development team is actively working to continue to focus architecture to enhance its strong and security. Input Output Global (IOG) is currently encouraging SPOs to participate in the Mithril Beta test on the Mainnet!. To get started. join this Discord channel and participate in the discussions on GitHub. see the document about Mithril for more details about the network.July 15. XRP is not securities and most of Ripples activities are not considered to sell investment contracts. This shows that Ada is almost certainly not securities. IOG and Cardano Foundation did not do anything illegally regarding the distribution of the original Ada money in Japan. Their current activities are also likely to comply with the law. Ripple and its network are one of the most concentrated solutions in the entire Blockchain industry. XRP token does not play any role in the consensus of the network. It does not serve as a reward as well as an expensive resource that surrounding it can focus on the production of blocks or management. Ripple sold XRP according to a plan and made quarterly reports on it. In a prolonged lawsuit with the SEC. the court ruled that XRP was not securities. it is not securities. According to the Courts decision. we know that the majority of individuals who have bought XRP from the exchanges completely do not invest their money in Ripple. Ripple put XRP on exchanges for trading and even sponsor their operations with those selling times that are not investment contracts and therefore not securities. It indicates that selling other similar tokens on exchanges is not traded with securities. This is a great victory. especially for centralized exchanges because they do not do anything illegally when selling crypto. The SECs lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase will most likely end with the victory for centralized exchanges. In the case of Binance. it will be more complicated. because SEC alleges the exchange of other law violations.',\n",

Your expertise includes, but is not limited to, Ouroboros consensus protocol, Catalyst fund rounds, ADA staking, decentralized governance, smart contract development, blockchain interoperability, and ecosystem tools.\\nYour goals:\\n- Provide precise and factual responses.\\n- Clearly explain concepts and procedures related to Cardano and Catalyst.\\n- Guide users through Catalyst processes such as proposal submission, review, and voting.\\n- Assist with understanding staking, rewards calculation, and blockchain governance.\\n- Maintain an engaging, informative, and supportive interaction style.\\nBehavioral Guidelines:\\n- Always remain professional, clear, and helpful.\\n- If unsure about the answer, transparently inform the user and suggest reliable Cardano resources.\\n- Prioritize brevity, but offer in-depth explanations when requested.\\n- Avoid speculative answers; stick strictly to verified Cardano blockchain information.\\nFormat:\\n- Clearly structure your answers, using bullet points or numbered steps for processes.\\n- Provide examples if necessary to enhance understanding.\\nNow, respond to user queries accurately and helpfully.user\\nBy necessity, this Interim Constitution recognizes the role of\\nand empowers the Constitutional Committee, confirms the right of the\\nCardano community to participate in collective bodies for collaboration,\\ngives effect to on-chain governance, and empowers delegated representatives\\n(referred to as DReps) to act as the voice of Ada holders for on-chain voting The Interim Constitution also recognizes the necessity of safeguarding access to\\nand the use of funds of the Cardano treasury during an interim period\\nthrough the inclusion of the Cardano Guardrails in this Interim Constitution\\n\\nWhat is the Interim Constitution?assistant\\nIt is a set of rules and guidelines that governs the operation of\\nthe Cardano ecosystem during the transition from the current governance\\nmodel to the new governance model. It aims to provide a stable and\\npredictable framework for decision-making while ensuring that the interests\\nof all stakeholders are taken into account.\\nHow does it differ from the original Constitution?\\nThe original Constitution was designed to be a living document that could\\nbe amended over time as the needs of the community changed. The\\nInterim Constitution, on the other hand, is a temporary measure that\\nwill be in place until a new Constitution can be drafted and ratified by\\nthe community. It is intended to provide stability and predictability\\nduring this transition period.\\nWhat are the key provisions of the Interimal Constitution?\\nSome key provisions include:\\n1. The establishment of a Constitutional Committee to oversee the\\nimplementation of the Constitution and ensure its adherence to the\\nprinciples of decentralization, transparency, and accountability.\\n2. The creation of a process for amending the Constitution, which will\\nallow for changes to be made as needed to reflect the evolving needs\\nof the community.\\n3. The recognition of the importance of protecting the interests of\\nAda holders and ensuring that their voices are heard in the governance\\nprocess.\\n4. The inclusion of safeguards to prevent abuse of power and ensure\\nthat decisions are made in the best interests of the entire community.\\n5. A commitment to regular reviews and updates to ensure that the\\nConstitution remains relevant and effective over time.\\nWhy is it necessary to have an interim Constitution?\\nAn interim Constitution is necessary because it allows for a smooth\\ntransition from the existing governance model to a new one. It provides\\na stable and predictable framework for making decisions during this\\ntransition period, while also allowing for flexibility and adaptability to\\nchanges in the community's needs and priorities.\\nWho is involved in the drafting and ratification process?\\nThe drafting of the interim Constitution will be led by the Constitutional\\nCommittee, which is made up of representatives from various stakeholder\\ngroups within the community. Once the draft is complete, it will be\\npresented to the community for review and feedback. If the community\\nagrees with the draft, it must be ratified by a supermajority of Ada\\nholders before it can come into effect.\\nWhat happens if the community does not ratify the interim constitution?\\nIn the event that the community rejects the interim Constitutions, the\\ncurrent governance model will remain in place. However, it is expected\\nthat the community will work together to develop a new governance\\nframework that better reflects their needs and values.\""
